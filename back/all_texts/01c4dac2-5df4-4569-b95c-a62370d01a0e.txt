On Saturday, Paul Ryan posted a photo to his Instagram.
The photo was a mass selfie of a large group of Capitol Hill interns.
It wasn t long before social media commentators noticed something very wrong with the photo.In his post, Ryan wrote: I think this sets a record for the most number of #CapitolHill interns in a single selfie.
#SpeakerSelfie.
So here s the photo:Photo via InstagramThat s a huge sea of white people.
Now, I am sure that the interns shown in the photo have worked very hard to get to where they are; however, it is very problematic to see that the people who aid lawmakers don t even come close to representing the United States.

According to a report released in 2015 by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, minorities are severely underrepresented on the Capital Hill.
One of the key findings of the report is that: Although people of color make up over 36 percent of the U.S. population and over 28 percent of the citizen voting-age population, they represent only 7.1 percent of top Senate staffers.
They report also says that, Senate offices representing states with large Hispanic and AfricanAmerican populations hire few senior staffers of color.
Commentators quickly made the connection between the lack of diversity in the photo and the GOP autopsy report that concluded that the Republican Party is going to go extinct if they do not reach out to minorities and try to get them to join their ranks.Republicans hate hiring mandates but they sure know how to make a case for them, as we can clearly see from the photo.Featured image from screenshot via Instagram
