Police are investigating a possible hate crime after a bomb went off inside a women s restroom in Target.On Wednesday, law enforcement responded to the Target retail store in Evanston, Illinois after a small explosive device went off inside the women s bathroom.
No one was hurt and the damage was minor, but authorities are looking into whether or not this was a hate crime.According to WGN:Early indications are that a plastic bottle was used but no projectiles like nails or tacks were inside it.
Investigators are gathering evidence including examining store security camera video.For months, conservatives have been viciously protesting the retail giant over the decision to let transgender customers use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity.An online petition to boycott Target has been signed by over 1 million people and right-wingers have literally entered the store to harass employees and customers with annoying religious rhetoric and hate speech.Here s the video via WGN.The hate against the LGBT community has reached fever pitch in many red states, where Republicans have passed and enacted discriminatory laws allowing business owners to refuse service to LGBT people if they have a sincere religious belief.
It would certainly not be surprising if the perpetrator of this bombing ends up being a disgruntled right-wing bigot.
After all, they are the only one obsessed with stopping people from using the women s bathroom and this bomb certainly achieved that goal, albeit temporarily.Conservatives certainly better hope that one of their own rabid extremists isn t responsible for this act of terrorism.Because if that turns out to be the case, then right-wing nut jobs would have proven themselves far more dangerous to women s safety in bathrooms than transgender people have ever posed since there has not been one instance of a transgender person sexually assaulting a woman in the bathroom across the 17 states and over 200 cities that have protections in place for transgender people.Featured image via screen capture
