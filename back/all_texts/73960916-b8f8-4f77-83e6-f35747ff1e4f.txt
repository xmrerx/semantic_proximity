You know things are getting bad on the campaign trail when you have to appeal to the child in everyone by offering French fries for everyone.
Well, that s exactly what happened at a rally in Iowa over the weekend while presidential hopeful Ted Cruz was apparently trying to appeal to the future voters of America.
This is the stuff you have to do when you don t really have any accomplishments to speak of besides shutting down the government and pissing people off.In a lame attempt at throwing First Lady Michelle Obama under the bus, Ted Cruz decided healthy food is for suckers, we need to bring back all the stuff that makes our kids fat and lazy, so Cruz says: Let me say something to the school-aged kids here.
When Heidi s first lady, French fries are coming back to the cafeteria The last I checked the cardboard was supposed to be on the tray and not in the food!
Yeah!
When Ted Cruz is president, it ll be French fries and sugary soda for everyone!!
Yeah!!
Then recess all day!
And no more homework!Cruz honestly sounded like he was running for student body president of the 6th grade.
Which probably isn t completely dumb, considering that the average Republican voter hasn t gotten past that reading and maturity level.So, everyone a vote for Cruz is a vote for French fries YEAH!Video/Featured image from Vine
