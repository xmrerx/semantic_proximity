benghazi , libya ( reuters ) - authorities in eastern libya have announced a conference in march to drum up support to rebuild the country s second-largest city benghazi heavily damaged during three years of fighting between military forces and islamist fighters .
the announcement signals a desire to demonstrate a return to normality in the port , where top military commander khalifa haftar declared the end of a campaign to oust islamist fighters in july .
clashes have sporadically continued in some isolated areas , while life has returned in the rest of the city , though some districts were almost completely destroyed by shelling and air strikes .
a forum titled international conference and exhibition for rebuilding benghazi city will be held from march 19-21 , the organizers said in an invitation posted online , adding that a six-day exhibition would be held the same month .
haftar is aligned with a government and parliament in eastern libya which was listed as the conference s sponsor .
he has rejected a u.n.-backed government based in the capital , tripoli , as he has gradually strengthened his position on the ground .
the united nations has sought to bridge differences between the two sides , part of a conflict since muammar gaddafi was toppled in 2011 .
talks were suspended in october .
