#BREAKING @RealBenCarson on #foxreport: If after meeting and they (Trump Transition Team) decide they want me, then I wouldn't turn it down HARRISFAULKNER (@HARRISFAULKNER) November 21, 2016 I didn t 100% say that I would never serve.
I just said that my preference would be to stay outside.
Basically I ve said, my preference was to be outside, and to act as an advisor.
But if after going through the process, they all conclude that, you now, that it would be much better to have me in the cabinet, I would have to give that some serious consideration.
It s just not my preference.
