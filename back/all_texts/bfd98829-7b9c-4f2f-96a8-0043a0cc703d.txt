Donald Trump threw a party to celebrate the New Year, so let s ruin his good time by looking back at the best of Alec Baldwin s masterful impersonations of him on Saturday Night Live.2016 was a tough year that most Americans would rather forget.
We lost beloved musicians, actors, and childhood heroes.
But 2016 was a good one for Alec Baldwin as he scored the role of a lifetime because of the stupidity of Donald Trump.Once the presidential debates rolled around in September, Baldwin stepped up and delivered a perfect performance as Trump.
It has been so good, in fact, that Trump has whined about it on Twitter every time Baldwin has appeared on the show.Just tried watching Saturday Night Live unwatchable!
Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can t get any worse.
Sad Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night.
It is a totally one-sided, biased show nothing funny at all.
Equal time for us?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016From his debate gaffes to his tweeting as president-elect, Baldwin took satire to a new hilarious level that nailed Trump as the bumbling Putin-loving buffoon he has always been.Here s the video via YouTube.And just think, Baldwin will have four more years to play the role as the real Trump fumbles American foreign and domestic policy every day as he pretends to be the legitimately elected President of the United States.So while Trump is busy destroying the country, at least we can escape our grim reality for at least a few precious minutes every Saturday to watch Baldwin troll Trump with a portrayal that will make him lash out like a petulant child.
That is, unless Trump goes full dictator and ends Saturday Night Live for making fun of him.Featured image via screenshot
