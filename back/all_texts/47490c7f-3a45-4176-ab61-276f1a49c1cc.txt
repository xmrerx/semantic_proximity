Former House of Representatives member and Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Jason Chaffetz (UT-R) was a guest on the Judge Jeanine show last night.
Judge Jeanine started out her segment with Chaffetz talking about how Hillary Clinton and friends keep lying and obfuscating the law.
She asked Chaffetz what he could tell her about what s being done, and asked Chaffetz, What can you do?
Chaffetz replied to Judge Jeanine: Yeah, it s been more than a year now, and the State Department is holding tens of thousands of documents on a case that they claim is closed!
And when I met with Attorney General Sessions much like Ron DeSantis did, I basically got a stiff arm.
I got an Attorney General that said he would not comply, he wasn t going to do any sort of prosecutions and it s, it s such a huge difference.
When he was a Senator he would have never put up with that.
But the deep state is very real.
They re pushing back, and we need to do an investigation on this.
Judge Jeanine asked if Attorney General Jeff Sessions was afraid of them?
She then went on to ask Chaffetz, What does a president have to do to get Sessions to do his job?
Judge Jeanine also asked Chaffetz, Should Jeff Sessions should be out?
Chaffetz replied, Well, I don t know what the case is to keep him in this place, if he s not going to look at the obvious conflicts of interest.
