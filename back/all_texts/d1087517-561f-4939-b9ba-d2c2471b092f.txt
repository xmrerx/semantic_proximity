David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard, finally got what he deserved when he was forced out of a racist protest on Saturday in New Orleans, Louisiana.The protest Duke attended was to counter the Take Em Down NOLA protest, which was calling for the removal of a Confederate statue of Andrew Jackson but fortunately, Duke was stopped when a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters chased him away.
Sadly, this confrontation didn t occur before Duke could share some of his white supremacist rhetoric with the crowd.
Duke preached: I tell you one thing.
It was built by the forefathers of the European Americans who created this country and who gave us our constitution.
Who gave us our freedoms and they should not lose their rights and liberty in their own country.
They should not have their statues taken down.
They should not lose their culture of this society.
I am here to defend our American heritage.
Our Louisiana heritage and our New Orleans heritage.
But it didn t take long before protesters surrounded Duke, and started calling him out.
A crowd gathered and chanted things like Racist, fascist, anti-gay!
and Right-wing bigot go away!
These protesters refused to let up until they had forced Duke out of Jackson Square completely.TwitterYou can watch the video of Duke being driven out by protesters below:David Duke is yet another racist white man who serves as a major threat to this country.
Duke is not only one of Donald Trump s most racist, loyal supporters, but he is now running for Senate in Louisiana after being inspired by the support that Donald Trump s hateful rhetoric has received from racist voters.Trump has created an environment where racists like Duke believe they can thrive, and it s becoming more and more critical that we continue to shut down white supremacy whenever we see it.
These protesters did an amazing job in the face of hate, and hopefully Duke will be even just a little bit discouraged.Featured image Twitter and screenshot
