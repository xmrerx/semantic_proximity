Tom Hanks, Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin and Amy Poehler are among the notables set to appear on a telethon to benefit the ACLU that will stream March 31 via Facebook Live.
Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU is billed as a modern-day telethon to raise funds for the venerable advocacy organization that has been working overtime with legal challenges to aspects of President Trump s political agenda.
Our work in the courts is essential right now to hold off the worst of the abuses, said ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero.
But it is also the collective will and tireless actions of we the people that serve as a bulwark against unconstitutional and wrong-headed policies and executive orders.
By supporting our work through this telethon, we can fight even harder to defend the rights guaranteed by our Constitution.
Here s a little Facebook promo for the event:More talent is expected to sign on in the coming days.
