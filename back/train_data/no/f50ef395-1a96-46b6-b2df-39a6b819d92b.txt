kiev ( reuters ) - ukraine has expelled a russian journalist working for the television channel ntv as punishment for spreading anti-ukrainian propaganda and justifying the actions of separatists , the state security service ( sbu ) said on thursday .
relations between kiev and moscow have been poisoned since moscow annexed crimean from ukraine in 2014 and backed a separatist insurgency in ukraine s eastern donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people despite a notional ceasefire .
ukraine says russia is fighting a hybrid war with kiev , spreading propaganda while supporting the separatists with troops and sophisticated weaponry and launching cyber attacks on ukrainian infrastructure , which moscow denies .
vyacheslav nemyshev was expelled in the early hours of thursday for preparing a series of false anti-ukrainian materials , the sbu state security service said .
the propagandist is forbidden from entering ukraine for three years .
ntv said on its website the incident confirmed that it was practically impossible for russian journalists to work in ukraine today .
i was at the police station for five hours , first the police took testimony from me , then the sbu officers , ntv quoting nemyshev as saying .
after that we drove around kiev for a really long time , then we stopped at some street where i sat in a car in the dark .
after that , they told me that everything had been decided , and we went to the border .
ukraine in august detained and then deported another russian journalist for spreading anti-ukrainian propaganda , a move condemned both by russia and the organization for security and co-operation in europe , which monitors the donbass war .
the security service had also barred two spanish journalists for their negative coverage of the conflict .
