who likes donald trump ?
not democrats .
not women , young adults , hispanics or independents , either .
half of republican voters don t even like him.according to a new poll conducted jointly by the washington post and abc news , donald trump is unpopular with just about everyone in the country.in fact , the washington post reports that trump has the worst favorability rating of any candidate in the survey s 32-year-long history.the poll shows that 67 percent of all voters view trump unfavorably.certain demographics like him less than others .
for example , 75 percent of women view him unfavorably .
among young voters , 80 percent have an unfavorable view of the current republican frontrunner .
not surprisingly , hispanic voters like trump the least , with 85 percent having an unfavorable view.half of all republican voters said they view trump unfavorably .
what s more , just 20 percent of republicans said they would oppose attempts to stop trump from gaining the party s nomination .
more than twice as many , 43 percent , said they would support such an effort.while only 34 percent of republicans surveyed said they want to see trump become president of the united states , that number is still higher than the number of voters who support challengers ted cruz or john kasich.he may manage to gain the republican nomination , but trump s very low favorability rating is not going to carry him through a general election.according to real clear politics , both democratic candidates would defeat donald trump in the general election.hillary clinton leads trump by 10.6 points , according to the site s general election matchup predictions.clinton s democratic competitor , bernie sanders , leads trump by an even larger margin nationally , with a 15.8 percentage point lead over the republican frontrunner.it s easy to see why republicans are willing to do just about anything to stop trump from winning the party s nomination.trump may poll favorably among a small portion of republican voters , but you can t win a general election when democrats , independents , women , hispanic voters , young adults , even half of the people in your own party literally despise you.featured image via scott olson/getty images
