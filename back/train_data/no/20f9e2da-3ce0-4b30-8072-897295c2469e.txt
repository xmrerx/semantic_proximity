kiev ( reuters ) - ukraine said on tuesday it had expelled a belarussian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move linked to allegations from belarus that the ukrainian defense ministry had set up a spy ring in minsk .
belarus s kgb state security service said on monday it had arrested a ukrainian journalist and declared a ukrainian diplomat persona non grata due to their alleged involvement in espionage .
the ukrainian foreign ministry has also made the decision to declare a belarussian diplomat persona non grata and he has already left the country , ukrainian foreign ministry spokeswoman mariana betsa said by telephone .
betsa said the diplomat was a first secretary in the embassy in kiev but declined to name him or her .
the ukrainian defense ministry has denied the kgb s allegations .
minsk-based ukrainian journalist pavlo sharoyko was arrested in october and has since been charged with being an undercover intelligence officer by the kgb .
reuters has not been able to reach him for comment .
the case puts further pressure on relations between minsk and kiev that were tested earlier this year when belarus hosted large-scale joint military exercises with russia .
september s zapad-2017 ( west-2017 ) war games unnerved ukraine and nato member states on europe s eastern flank , which feared the exercises could be a rehearsal or cover for a real offensive .
