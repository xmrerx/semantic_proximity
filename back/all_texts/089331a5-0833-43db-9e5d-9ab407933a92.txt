Donald Trump is counting on a big win tonight, although most pollsters indicate a victory for Hillary Clinton.
Still yet, we re sure he s prepared a concession speech.
Joking!
In preparation for Donald s victory party, he has a cash bar set up for guests, according to Ben Jacobs of The Guardian on Twitter.
We do hope Donald has paid the bar staff in advance.
Also, his baker.

Margaux Nasty Gray (@RedGray) November 8, 2016As we wait in anticipation for the results to come in tonight, exit polling shows that Hillary Clinton s ground game is far superior to that of Donald Trump s. But, Donald has a cake and a cash bar!Image via Twitter.
