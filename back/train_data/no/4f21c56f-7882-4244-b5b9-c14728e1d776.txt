beirut ( reuters ) - the death toll from air strikes on a syrian town in a de-escalation zone has risen to 61 , a war monitor said on tuesday , a demonstration of the fragile state of areas set up in attempt to ease the violence .
jihadist rebels blamed russian warplanes of carrying out monday s attack and said they would fight back against syrian president bashar al-assad s forces and his russian and iranian backers in the six-year-old conflict .
the british-based syrian observatory for human rights said three air strikes hit the market in atareb , west of aleppo , and killed at least 61 people .
atareb is inside what is known as a de-escalation zone under an agreement between turkey , russia and iran to reduce the bloodshed .
but despite the diplomatic efforts , fighting continues in many areas , including aleppo , idlib , raqqa , deir al-zor and hama .
( the zones ) did de-escalate fighting , u.n. humanitarian adviser jan egeland told reuters .
but lately , there has been increased fighting also .
the zones were set up under the astana process , a series of talks in the capital of kazakhstan between russia and iran , and the rebels supporter turkey .
they agreed in september to deploy observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in syria s idlib province , which is largely under the control of islamist insurgents .
following the air strikes , the tahrir al-sham jihadist alliance denounced the ceasefire talks and pledged to keep fighting government forces and their russian and iranian allies .
this aggression and crimes confirms for us that there is no solution with the colonizers without fighting and struggling , it said .
tahrir al-sham includes the group formerly known as the nusra front , which changed its name last year when it broke formal ties to al qaeda .
