jerusalem ( reuters ) - an ultra-orthodox jewish lawmaker resigned from the israeli legislature on wednesday after drawing rabbis wrath for attending his gay nephew s wedding .
yigal guetta of the shas party said in an israeli radio interview earlier this week that he and his family had gone to the celebration , held two years ago in israel , because he wanted his sister s son to be happy , although gay marriage violated his own religious beliefs .
a letter published on monday by five prominent israeli rabbis said same-sex marriage is an abomination .
accusing guetta of desecrating god s will , they called on his party to fire him .
guetta made no immediate public statement after his resignation was confirmed by party officials .
the newspaper haaretz quoted a source close to the politician as saying he had refused to apologize and decided to quit , to avoid being asked to do so by shas s own religious sages , who set party policy .
same-sex weddings held in israel are not sanctioned by the state , and only orthodox rabbis can issue marriage licenses .
couples may marry without a license , but the union won t be officially recognized .
israel does recognize same-sex couples who marry abroad and any other non-orthodox weddings performed outside of the country .
