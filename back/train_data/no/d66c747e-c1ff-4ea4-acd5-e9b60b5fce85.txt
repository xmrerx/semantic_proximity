was o reilly out-of-bounds ?
most americans would likely agree that we need to address the viability of employment opportunities for poorly educated americans of every race who are walking around with multiple facial piercings and tattoos on their faces.donald trump appeared on the o reilly factor monday night , but for once it wasn t the presidential candidate making headlines for his controversial remarks.instead , it was bill o reilly himself who sparked fury after making statements about african-americans that many called racist.during the interview , o reilly pointed out that trump is not polling well among minority voters , and questioned the republican front-runner about his strategy for winning over black voters.trump responded by saying he was doing fantastic with african-americans and with hispanics before launching into a speech about how the real issue was that jobs were being outsourced to countries like china and mexico.o reilly then pushed trump to explain exactly how he could promise jobs to black voters , while offending many african-americans at the same time .
how are you going to get jobs for them ?
o reilly asked .
many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads , and i hate to be generalized about it but it s true , if you look at all the educational statistics , how are you going to give jobs to people who aren t qualified for jobs ?
via : daily mailby the way bill , there are no shortage of white people or hispanics walking around with face tattoos .
i m as sick as the next person of the excessive pc world we live in , but bill s comments were pretty idiotic , has no basis and should be condemned .
