of course , the left applauded miss great britain s bold defiance of the rules ( resistance is all the rage in case you haven t heard ) ignoring the fact that no one held a gun to her head to make her compete in the pageant.the magazine that teaches teenage girls how to have anal sex had this to say about how proud they were of muna jama : she stuck to her beliefs and the internet could n't be prouder https : //t.co/lyqbnepkwg teen vogue ( @ teenvogue ) august 4 , 2017the swimsuit competition .
watching contestants parade around in barely-there swimsuits is synonymous with the world of beauty pageants the way sashes and rictus grins and pledges for world peace are.but now one contestant has thrown out the rulebook , and competed in the finals for miss universe great britain wearing a kaftan , rather than a two-piece.muna jama , from london , is muslim and earlier this year won the right to compete in the famed competition wearing a kaftan .
it is the first time in the history of the competition that a contestant has not not donned a revealing bikini.here is a picture of the other ( less special ) miss universe contestants wearing the required bikini for the bathing suit competition : help me congratulate the outstanding and beautiful anna burdzy as miss universe great britain 2017 , i m proud to have come this far with the pleasure to share the stage with all these incredible women !
for this i feel like a winner thank you for following me on my journey , it wouldn t have been the same without your encouraging messages , constant support and nonstop love that i was able to make history for the first time ever !
thank you .

however , this year , jama , who is the co-founder of a start-up tackling illegal migration and child abuse in africa , decided to apply again , but this time petitioning officials to be allowed to wear a kaftan .
i wouldn t wear a bikini to a beach , so i m not going to wear one in a competition to score points , she has told metro.co.uk .
nyphere s a picture of the bathing suit miss great britain wore during the competition : it takes bravery , emotional resilience and most importantly surrounding yourself with strong minded people who are prepared to make great sacrifices to welcome permanent and positive change .
i may not be able to unwrite a moment in my life but i know a moment will never define me .
i will always rise above your expectations and pushed past your limitations .
you are what you say you are , and your imaginations can be your worst enemy unless you overcome your fears .
be careful of what you think of others because it s a reflection of what you are .
work at being a better person , and one day we can welcome a better world .
.
.
this moment has proved that i am capable of almost anything i set my mind to and limitations is a status waiting to be changed .
i thank everyone who stood beside me and believed in my vision .
