BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Palestinian cause will stay alive among Arabs until the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, the Syrian president s office said on Wednesday in response to U.S. President Donald Trump s Jerusalem decision.
The future of Jerusalem is not determined by a state or a president but is determined by its history and by the will and determination in the Palestinian cause, President Bashar al-Assad s office said on an official social media feed.
