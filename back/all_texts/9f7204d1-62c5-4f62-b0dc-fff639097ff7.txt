WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday said it will rely on international experts to ensure that Iran is living up to its commitments to curtail its nuclear program.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) report on Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement is more than a technicality and there is ample reason to distrust Iran.
