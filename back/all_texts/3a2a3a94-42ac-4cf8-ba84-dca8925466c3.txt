Yesterday, after Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called for the vote on the GOP s health care bill to be delayed until after the July 4 recess, Donald Trump met with GOP senators in a closed-door meeting to discuss how the failing bill might be saved.
There s just one major problem: Trump doesn t know what the f*ck he s talking about!
In fact, he probably doesn t even know what is in the bill.The New York Times recapped the meeting, and hidden in the report was a certain gem from an anonymous senate staffer who was present in the meeting.
The account from this staffer truly proves that Trump is running the country blind and has no idea what s going on.
The staffer said: A senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the White House with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan and seemed especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy.
This senate staffer also said that Trump seemed oblivious to the fact that the health care bill had tax implications, because in the meeting the POTUS said he would handle tax reform at a later time.
Considering that Trump doesn t read and is incapable of focusing his attention on anything besides tweets, it s highly possible that Trump hasn t even looked at this health care bill.To make matters even worse, Trump demonstrated a delusional sense of comfort when he declared the meeting a success on Twitter.
Trump tweeted: I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare.
They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!
This proves that Trump is absolutely insane, and his incompetency has become a major threat to the well-being of all Americans.
He doesn t even know what s in his own legislation.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images
