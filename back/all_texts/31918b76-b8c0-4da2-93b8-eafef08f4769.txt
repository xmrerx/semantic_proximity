One after another, Republicans are breaking ranks with their party and saying they just can t throw their support behind the GOP s appalling excuse for a healthcare plan.
With so many conservatives jumping ship, it is starting to look more and more likely that the American Health Care Act is set to fail.Bloomberg reporter Steven Dennis reported on Friday that Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) issued a statement saying he cannot support the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare in its current form.
It is estimated that the AHCA would result in 24 million people losing their insurance coverage by 2026, with 14 million of these people finding themselves without health care by the end of the year.Heller said he agrees with Nevada Gov.
Brian Sandoval, who recently joined with Ohio Gov.
John Kasich, Arkansas Gov.
Asa Hutchinson and Michigan Gov.
Rick Snyder to argue that the GOP plan would be disastrous in states that had expanded Medicaid.
Heller said that he just can t support the AHCA in its current form.

Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) March 17, 2017It is looking like the AHCA, even if it manages to pass the House, will crash and burn in the Senate.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said on Thursday that she will not support the bill as it is written.
Several other Republican senators have criticized the bill, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT).
As much as the GOP would like to believe otherwise, Republicans aren t necessarily just going to fall in line and vote in favor of the bill.Senate NO votes on AHCA as written: COLLINS PAUL HELLER Major critics include: CASSIDY COTTON LEE CRUZ + MURKOWSKI says won t defund PP Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) March 17, 2017Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
