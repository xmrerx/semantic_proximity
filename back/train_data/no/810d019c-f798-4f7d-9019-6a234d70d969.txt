beirut ( reuters ) - the party of lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri , who unexpectedly quit a week ago while in saudi arabia , denounced on saturday attacks against the kingdom and iranian intervention in arab countries .
hariri s future movement political party said it stands by him and was waiting impatiently for his return to lebanon to handle his national responsibilities in leading this stage .
hariri s shock resignation , in a broadcast from riyadh last week , has plunged lebanon into crisis and thrust it back into the forefront of regional rivalry between iran and saudi arabia .
