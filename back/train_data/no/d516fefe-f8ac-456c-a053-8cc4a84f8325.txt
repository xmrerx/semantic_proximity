cairo ( reuters ) - egypt s public prosecutor has ordered the detention of 29 people suspected of espionage on behalf of turkey and joining a terrorist organization , state news agency mena reported on wednesday .
according to the results of an investigation by the general intelligence services , the group has been recording phone calls and passing information to turkish intelligence as part of a plan to bring the muslim brotherhood back to power in egypt , mena said .
the nationalities of the suspects were not specified .
they are also accused of money laundering and trading currency without a license .
ties between ankara and cairo have been strained since the army ousted president mohamed mursi of the brotherhood following mass protests against his rule in 2013 .
the muslim brotherhood has close ties with turkey s ruling ak party and many of its members have fled to turkey since the group s activities were banned in egypt .
following mursi s ouster , egypt branded the brotherhood , the world s oldest islamist movement , a terrorist organisation and most of its senior members have been arrested , driven into exile or underground .
the brotherhood says it is a peaceful organization and has condemned the crackdown .
