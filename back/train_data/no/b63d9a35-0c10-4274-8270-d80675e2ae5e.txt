cairo ( reuters ) - egypt s united nations envoy on tuesday criticized u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al-hussein s remarks on systemic violence in the country , saying they reflected flawed logic , state news agency mena reported .
ambassador amr ramadan was quoted as saying that he had cautioned zeid against his office becoming a mouthpiece for paid agencies with political and economic agendas , and he rejected his accusations , without elaborating .
at a un human rights council meeting in geneva on monday , hussein said the state of emergency declared by the egyptian government last april had been used to justify systemic silencing of civil society .
he cited reports of waves of arrests , arbitrary detention , black-listing , travel bans , asset freezes , intimidation and other reprisals against human rights defenders , journalists , political dissidents and those affiliated with the muslim brotherhood group .
last week egypt came under fire from human rights watch , which said in a report that there was systemic torture in the country s jails , leading cairo to block access to hrw s website .
egypt s human rights parliamentary committee , which was critical of the report , has also developed an action plan in response , state media reported on tuesday .
the plan reportedly includes meeting with foreign diplomats in egypt and outside the country to explain its efforts to defend human rights .
