real journalism hit washington today !
one of our favorite citizen journalists went at the main stream media full force .
the video below is what happens when you turn the tables on the press they freak out .
they can t handle it .
notice how the reporters in the video below are a little shocked when the tables are turned and someone yells a question to them .
you ll love the question too !
this is a classic ! washington the journalist who scooped the establishment media and unmasked susan rice as a key figure in the obama administration spying scandal turned the tables monday and grilled white house reporters about how they are doing their jobs.or not doing them as soon as press secretary sean spicer concluded his daily briefing and left the room , documentary filmmaker mike cernovich addressed reporters and loudly asked , why will nobody here cover the violence against trump supporters ?
a confused hush fell over the room as reporters , unaccustomed to being on the receiving end of shouted questions , tried to figure out what was going on.but cernocivh immediately continued , and why won t you demand that leaders of the democrats disavow the violence by antifa the way you demanded trump disavow violence from his supporters ?
he then answered his own question by telling the room : this has been completely covered up .
you have no answer .
are you a journalist ?
asked april ryan , white house correspondent and washington bureau chief for american urban radio networks .
i am , madame .
i am a reporter , i am a documentary filmmaker , he repliedafter today 's press briefing was compete , a journalist asked about political violence by the left .
real journalism , finally !
