HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean soldiers and armored vehicles blocked roads to the main government offices, parliament and the courts in central Harare, a Reuters witness said on Wednesday, after the military said it had seized power in a targeted assault on criminals around President Robert Mugabe.
Nearby, some Zimbabweans queued for cash outside banks while public taxis ferried commuters to work.
