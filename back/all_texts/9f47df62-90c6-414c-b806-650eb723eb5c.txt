Donald Trump has turned yet another meeting in which he should have been focusing on being America s president and getting sh*t done into an absolute circus and embarrassment.During a meeting with airline executives, Trump decided that he was bored and could no longer focus, so he went on a completely incoherent rant about things his personal pilot had told him.
As you can imagine, everyone in the room was shocked as Trump continued to hijack the meeting and went on babbling, making it impossible to actually get anything accomplished until he was finished.According to the White House pool report, Trump commended airlines for succeeding despite the bad equipment that the airport gives you, in many cases.
Then he started complaining about the equipment, stating that he had a pilot who s a real expert who once told him that airlines are often given the wrong stuff.
Trump continued: Let s order the right equipment.
Probably the wrong equipment cost more.
Here are some more gems from his rant: We want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service and with an absolute minimum of delays.
We spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East, we got nothing.
And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports.
As you can imagine, most of this rant made zero sense.
This has become a pattern for Trump he continues to meet with industry CEOs, but he doesn t actually accomplish anything.
He doesn t tackle policy, and he spends most of his time talking about himself or complaining.
This shouldn t be too surprising, considering that we elected a former reality television star who knows NOTHING about policy, so he s obviously doing whatever he can to pass the time in these meetings.You can watch Trump go completely off track in the meeting below:Read more:Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images
