rush limbaugh nailed it today when he said : trump s a different animal .
they [ the press ] don t know how to deal with it , and he s making em look like children .
in this press conference today there was a man in the front row from cnn , a reporter in the front row , and he kept shouting at trump like a little child .
he demanded that trump take his question .
he started shouting at trump while trump was answering other questions , and trump refused to take the question and looked at the him and said , no , you re fake news .

and that s when i started laughing and applauding here when we were covering this live .
