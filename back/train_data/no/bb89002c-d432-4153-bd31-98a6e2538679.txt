thinking before you speak is basically a required skill if you want to be a lawmaker , but missouri gop senator roy blunt didn t get the memo.in the wake of the orlando mass shooting , republicans have been accusing president obama of being weak against isis because he won t say the words radical islamic terrorism .
it s as if the gop believes saying the words will magically make the terrorists go away .
what exactly would using this language accomplish ?
president obama demanded to know in remarks made last week .
what exactly would it change ?
would it make isil less committed to try and kill americans ?
would it bring in more allies ?
is there a military strategy that is served by this ?
the answer is none of the above .
calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away .
but republican senator roy blunt is now accusing his democratic opponent of being weak on terrorism because he also hasn t said the words.blunt , who cowardly dodged the draft during the vietnam war through the use of student deferments posted the accusation against jason kander on twitter .
despite ft .
hood , boston & orlando , @ jasonkander won t acknowledge the root of threats we face : radical islam , he wrote on monday night after being criticized for voting to kill several gun control reforms that would ban suspected terrorists from buying guns.despite ft .

i volunteered to serve in afghanistan to fight radical islamic terrorism , kander wrote while also including the words blunt accused him of refusing to say .
think before you tweet .

cale miller ( @ cale_miller ) june 21 , 2016roy blunt should be ashamed and embarrassed , and he should definitely think about who he is talking to before he writes something so ridiculous on twitter .
because right now , karma is biting him hard on the ass.featured image : flickr
