The GOP implosion is about to be set off as influential Republican leaders are on the cusp of staging an intervention with presidential nominee Donald Trump.Yes, you read that right three months before a presidential election, a candidate is being given an ultimatum by their party leaders about cleaning up their act or dropping out of the race.You couldn t even make this stuff up for TV, let alone reality.According to NBC News:Key Republicans close to Donald Trump s orbit are plotting an intervention with the candidate after a disastrous 48 hours led some influential voices in the party to question whether Trump can stay at the top of the Republican ticket without catastrophic consequences for his campaign and the GOP at large.Republican National Committee head Reince Priebus, former Republican New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are among the Trump endorsers hoping to talk the real estate mogul into a dramatic reset of his campaign in the coming days.The intervention comes as Trump has repeatedly been attracting negative press for a slew of gaffes, including attacking the Khans whose son was killed in battle kicking out a crying baby at his rally, selfishly accepting a Purple Heart, and backstabbing fellow Republicans running for reelection.In the last several days, influential Republicans, from policy advisers under Reagan to Congressman Richard Hanna and mega-donor Meg Whitman, have publicly stated they will be voting for Hillary Clinton over the GOP nominee.
Heck, even John McCain s granddaughter is voting for Hillary Clinton.
It seems that with every passing day another Republican wakes up and realizes how truly damaging Trump is.Of course the Trump campaign denied such an intervention was in the works and pathetically tried to convince the public that the campaign was more unified than ever.
Republicans are more scared that he will drop out of the race, something that seems very unlikely.As of right now, the Trump train has derailed and is heading on a crash course into a ditch.Can anyone remember a time in our American electoral history when a presidential candidate was forced to undergo an intervention to clean up his act?
This is something completely unheard of, but lo and behold, it s happening right before our eyes.Remember when Republicans told us he would change his tune when he secured the delegates needed to be the nominee?
Guess that was just another lie.
And now they are paying the price, and, if Democrats show up to vote in November, it will pay off beautifully.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
