WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote later Wednesday on whether to begin debate on a Republican tax bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the chamber.
“Today the Senate will take the next important step toward fixing the tax code and helping middle-class families keep more of their hard earned money,” McConnell, a Republican, said as he opened the Senate.
Members would vote to begin debate on the bill, he added.
Democrats oppose the legislation, but only a simple majority is needed to start debate under special rules governing the tax legislation, which aims to cut taxes to businesses and individuals.
Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the Senate.
