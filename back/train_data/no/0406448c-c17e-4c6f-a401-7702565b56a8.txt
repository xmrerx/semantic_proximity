istanbul ( reuters ) - prominent turkish rights activist and businessman osman kavala has been jailed pending trial , charged with seeking to overthrow the government , state-run anadolu news agency reported on wednesday .
an istanbul court remanded kavala in custody as part of an investigation into the movement of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , which ankara accuses of carrying out an attempted coup in july last year , the agency said .
it said kavala was charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order and attempting to overthrow the government of the republic of turkey .
kavala , whose anadolu kultur organization is involved in promoting culture and rights , was detained nearly two weeks ago at istanbul s ataturk airport , prompting expressions of concern from europe and the united states .
since the failed putsch on july 15 , 2016 , more than 50,000 people have been jailed as they face trial and some 150,000 sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector .
the u.s. state department described kavala s initial detention as an example of a very alarming trend of detention of civil society leaders , journalists , academics and activists in turkey .
the turkish government says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it faces .
gulen has denied involvement in last year s attempted coup .
