Another turn left for the Hillster so no school choice and no teacher accountability.
Would you vote for someone who favors the Union over your kids?
So much for liberating poor kids from failing schools While the media chase the Bernie Sanders rallies, keep your eye on the political crowds that matter.
On Saturday the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) endorsed Hillary Clinton 16 months before Election Day.This counts in the fight for the Democratic Party nomination because the 1.6 million member union boasts it can make a million phone calls and knock on 500,000 doors.
Bernie s Birkenstock irregulars can t match that political power and money.The endorsement is even more notable as another sign of Hillary s left political turn.
Democrats in New York and elsewhere have been debating education reform, but by embracing the AFT Mrs. Clinton is choosing the union status quo that opposes school choice and teacher accountability.Via: WSJ
