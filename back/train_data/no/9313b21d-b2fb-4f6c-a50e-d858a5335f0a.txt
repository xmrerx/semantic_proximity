this week president donald trump followed through with his most audacious building a wall along the us southern border with mexico.after his visit to the department of homeland security this afternoon , trump is set to sign government directives today that will set in motion the construction of a new system of border reinforcement which will include a number of new provisions -including the wall.the move is expected to correspond with announcements on stricter immigration procedures in the short term sending out a power message to illegal immigrants hoping to cross the us southern border from 2017.bloomberg adds : the trump administration is also considering a 120-day suspension of refugee admissions and cutting the total number allowed into the u.s. in the current fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000 , actions that could be announced as soon as thursday , according to a person familiar with the plan .
the border directives come immediately on the heals of trump s recent statements and executive move to renegotiate , or cancel washington s position in the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) and the transpacific partnership ( tpp ) .once again , trump is wasting no time putting his signature campaign issues into play something many of his critics have doubted he would be doing.read more mexico news at : 21st century wire mexico filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @ 21wire.tv
