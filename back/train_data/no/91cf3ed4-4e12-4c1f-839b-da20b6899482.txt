taipei ( reuters ) - a taiwan court on friday jailed a mainland chinese man for 14 months for breaching national security laws , following months of strained relations over china s detention of a national from the self-ruled island .
china , which sees taiwan as a wayward province to be taken back by force , if necessary , severed official communications last year to pressure president tsai ing-wen , whose party traditionally favors independence , to concede its position .
zhou hongxu , formerly a student in taiwan , was charged for seeking to arrange meetings between a taiwan government official and a chinese communist party official outside taiwan , in return for payment to the taiwan official , a court document showed .
zhou intentionally jeopardized national security , though the attempt was unsuccessful , the court said in the document released after the verdict .
zhou , who had met the chinese official at a 2014 event in shanghai in 2014 , did not plead guilty , his lawyer said , despite a confession during the trial that he later described as having been made in improper circumstances .
he appeared in court on friday in a calm mood and dressed in dark colors .
the court reduced his sentence , taking into account his confession , and the failure of the bid to breach national security , it said in its statement .
on monday , a taiwanese activist , li ming-che , confessed in a chinese court to attempting to subvert the beijing government , videos of his hearing released by chinese authorities showed , although his wife refused to recognize the court s authority .
li , a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism , had gone missing on a trip to mainland china in march .
