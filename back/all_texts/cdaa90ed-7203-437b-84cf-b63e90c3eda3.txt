According to Donald Trump, Obamacare has wreaked havoc for even longer than even the dumbest among conservatives thought.Speaking about healthcare a topic he often confuses with life insurance the Donald stood in front of a bunch of human props and complained:For the past 17 years, Obamacare has wreaked havoc on the lives on innocent, hard-working Americans No, seriously.
He actually said that and Mike Pence looks like he just ate a fart after hearing it:Trump thinks Obamacare is 17 years old.
In other words: Old enough to date.

MSNBC was quick to fact check this claim that the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare by detractors when it was passed under President Obama, became law under President Bill Clinton.Trump started his speech by saying Obamacare s been wreaking havoc for the past 17 years so that s cool.

Because our so-called President really is the dumbest motherf*cker alive.Naturally, Trump blew up Twitter with this new information that President Clinton signed Obamcare into law before the first debate on the issue happened:President Trump, speaking loudly over crying kids, says Obamacare has hurt the country for 17 years.

Christina Marie (@Christina_6381) July 24, 2017Wait, did the moron really say we've had the ACA for 17 years?
Come on 25th amendment, he's clearly lost it.
#resist Alan Griffin (@Gryphonskull) July 24, 2017At this point, it s fair to ask: Is there anything he won t blame on the Clintons?To be fair, he later says that seven years ago, a small group of politicians engineered a government takeover of healthcare years after he says Obamacare became law.Can we please have some 25th Amendment action?
Pretty please?Featured image via screengrab
