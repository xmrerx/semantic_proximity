Equinox Los Angeles, one of the swankiest gyms in America, where celebrities like Chloe Kardashian, Mickey Rourke, Renee Zellweger and Sean Combs have been seen exiting is apparently okay with accepting their exorbitant fees from gym members, as long as they don t support our current President, Donald J. Trump.On their Facebook page, Equinox makes no secret about the fact that transgenders are welcome at their DC location: Members pay $200 to $300 initiation fees and $160 to $250 monthly rates.
They rave about the gym s amenities, which include classes taught by former Olympians and spa treatments.Equinox gym makes it pretty clear however, in one of their Facebook posts that they tolerate all people of all beliefs.
They actually tell Facebook users that if they have narrow minds that they need not apply .
Hmmm .so asking a member to leave because he supports our president isn t narrow minded?
Watch the video below, as one of the sweetest conservative voices in social media, Jesse Lee Peterson tells his story of how he was treated by Equinox Gym in Los Angeles.
(The video cuts off part of Jesse s head, but his story is definitely worth listening to.)
Conservatives and specifically, conservative Trump supporters are under attack by leftist bullies everywhere.
We need to stand strong and stick together.
There has never been a more important time to stand your ground and be unafraid of who you are.
We cannot allow the Left to bully us into submission.
I was attacked, bullied and harassed by management @equinox Los Angeles because I support Trump!
