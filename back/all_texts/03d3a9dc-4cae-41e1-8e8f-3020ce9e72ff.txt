Ordinarily we would not celebrate the death of another human being, but some people are just so awful that they make us want to run into the streets and jump for joy when they finally bite the dust.
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was one of those people.
While the Republican Party is mourning his death, liberals aren t doing any such thing.
Sure, we feel sympathy for his family because they lost a loved one, but that s where it ends.Antonin Scalia spent his career on the Supreme Court violating the rights of everyone who was not a white, Christian, Republican male.
Not only did he help place George W. Bush in the White House in 2000, he also fought against women s rights, voting rights, and LGBT rights.
Justice Scalia was also a racist who believed that African-Americans are not smart enough to attend elite universities with white students.No, we are not saddened by his passing, we are relieved that he will no longer be able to inflict harm on the people of the United States.
Seriously though, I hope someone did that.
Doesn t seem very pro-life to me, but his decisions rarely were.
HAHAHAHAHA!Best day ever!
I stand with God, do you?
Very few .
Who is Clarence going to copy now?!
OMG what s going to happen to him?!
We have decided that Jesus wouldn t like that very much.
Thankfully, President Obama now has the opportunity to replace Satan s spawn with a justice who actually supports the Constitution and ALL of its amendments.
Republicans are going to fight like hell to keep this from happening, because they, like Scalia, do not care about this country or its citizens.
And this, my friends, is why it is so important that we put our Bernie/Hillary fighting aside and vote for whomever the Democratic Party picks as our candidate.I m going to leave you with this, the truest of all the Scalia memes: All images from Facebook/ Twitter/ Instagram
