benghazi , libya ( reuters ) - medical staff in the southern libyan city of sabha said on monday they were suspending work for 10 days in protest over poor security after a doctor was kidnapped .
health services in libya have been severely disrupted by years of conflict with the remote south particularly affected .
salem al-selhab , who worked in the surgical department of the sabha medical centre , the biggest hospital in southern libya , was kidnapped by an unknown group on thursday evening .
for a long time the medical staff of the sabha medical centre have suffered attacks , abuse and been shot at , said osama al-wafi , a spokesman for the center , adding that selhab s kidnapping was a serious setback .
this doctor was very important , he said .
staff at the center and at private clinics in the city announced a 10-day strike on sunday to demand selhab s release and the provision of security for medical staff .
sabha is a major hub for the smuggling of migrants toward libya s northern coast , some of whom seek treatment in local medical facilities .
the sabha medical centre receives 70 percent of its backing from international organizations in the absence of state support from rival governments in tripoli and the east , said wafi .
we suffer greatly from a shortage of medicines , political division and lack of support , he said .
the world health organization ( who ) , one of the international bodies to provide sabha medical centre with support , strongly condemned violence against staff in the area .
who urges all to refrain from attacking health workers and facilities , as required by international humanitarian law , and calls upon parties responsible for the kidnapping of the doctor in sabha to ensure his safety and immediate release , it said in a statement .
