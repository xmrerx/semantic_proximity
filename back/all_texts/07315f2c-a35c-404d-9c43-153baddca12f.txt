It s become a weekly ritual: Trump goes through each day, doing his Trumpian thing, and at the end of the week, various media outlets are recapping Trump s bad week.
This week, though, seems to have been especially bad for Trump, because Republicans are frightened.
They re frustrated.
They re confused.
And they don t think he ll win the election.At a private fundraiser for Rep. Joseph Heck (R-NV), Mitch McConnell asked the room of Republican supporters whether they think Trump can win.
Maybe half raised their hands.
When he asked whether they think Trump will win, however, the room fell silent, and not one person was able to raise their hand.Not.
One.
Person.
In that room.
Thinks Trump will win in November.The silence in that room had to deafening.
It s certainly telling.
When your own party s donors don t believe you will win your election, you ve got a huge problem.For his part, McConnell refuses to talk about Trump to the press.
When they caught up with him, he was curt, saying, This is not something I am going to discuss today, and then, Because I choose not to, when they pressed him on why.Even one of Trump s staunchest allies, Newt Gingrich, thinks his 3am tweetstorm about the dishonest press was wholly inappropriate to someone who wants to be president:.
@newtgingrich said @realDonaldTrump has got to become much more disciplined.
Do you agree?

But when the rest of the country doesn t, when even his own party doesn t, then he s in a lot of trouble.Too bad.
November 8th could end up being very humiliating for Trump.
