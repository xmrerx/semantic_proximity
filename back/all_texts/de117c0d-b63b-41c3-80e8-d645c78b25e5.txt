If you didn t think Republicans could stoop any lower, think again.Because if they have their way, there will be a state law in Washington that will guarantee that even our private body parts no longer remain private.In their effort to persecute transgender people, Washington state Republicans have chosen to push legislation that would force everyone to show their genitalia before they are allowed to use a bathroom.According to Pink News,Senate bill 6548 would amend equality legislation to state: Nothing in this chapter grants any right to a person to access a private facility segregated by gender, such as a bathroom, restroom, toilet, shower, locker room, or sauna, of a public or private entity if the person is preoperative, nonoperative, or otherwise has genitalia of a different gender from that for which the facility is segregated.
And because the bill solely relies on the presence of genitalia to determine who can use which bathroom, it means girls and boys would have to show their vaginas and penises to whatever stranger is guarding the bathroom in order to be let in.Imagine going to a library, a theme park, a theater, a business, or even school and having to stand in line for the bathroom with the horrifying thought that some strange person is going to have to examine you below the belt to determine which bathroom you can use.
It s sounds pretty damn embarrassing, not to mention cruel.But this is the strategy Republicans have come up with to discriminate against transgender people.The same kind of perverted legislation has already been proposed in VirginiaThat bill was strongly blasted by civil rights advocate Tim Peacock: This is what the conservative movement has devolved into: forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never-before-seen act of violence or sexual aggression (that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections).
Human Rights Campaign spokesperson Sarah Warbelow called the Washington bill urged people to demand that the bill be killed.
We urge all fair-minded people across the state to demand their lawmakers immediately stop these offensive assaults on fairness and equality, and we call on the Senate to vote down these dangerous measures if they come to a vote on the floor.
Republicans might as well announce to pedophiles everywhere that this is their chance to legally examine the private parts of children, because that s what this bill basically does.
An adult would be required to look at the private parts of children to determine which bathroom they can use so that a transgender child doesn t use what conservatives claim is the wrong bathroom.It s not hard to see that if this bill passes the lawsuits are going to pile up and clog our judicial system even more than it already is.
It s also not hard to see that this is a conservative dream come true, and it s a sick dream at that.Featured Image: Pixabay
