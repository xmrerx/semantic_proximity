neil degrasse tyson doesn t often jump into the political fray .
in fact , he s rather famous for holding the unscientific feet of both political parties to the fire , as he did on bill maher : that being said , there s no denying that tyson is a thinking man , which means he s not a fan of bigotry or the guns used in mass shootings .
his twitter reaction to the horrific massacre at the pulse nightclub in orlando , florida , was particularly poignant , despite being completely scientific.first , he questioned whether the second amendment is even a good idea : odd how many americans invoke the 2nd amendment to justify gun ownership , rather than explore whether or not it s a good idea neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 12 , 2016for that , tyson received a lot of pushback , but he was ready for it : @ charlescwcooke so then the tweet does not apply to you .
and of course it was a one liner because that s what tweets are .
neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 12 , 2016regardless of your view on guns , it s tough to deny that that massacre was also a hate crime .
tyson doesn t hate .
instead , he gave us the science of the rainbow the lgbt rainbow in a series of wonderful tweets : the exact rainbow any of us sees in the sky is entirely our own a personal , yet communal gift from the laws of optics .
neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016 rainbows are always the same angular size in the sky they are various segments of a circle that is 84-degrees across .
neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016a rainbow forms only broadside to your line of sight .
that s why the pot of gold at its base remains eternally out of reach .
neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016 isaac newton , in opticks ( 1704 ) , published his discovery that white light is composed of colors the colors in rainbows .
neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016if we had vision like @ startrek s giordi , rainbows would look twice as thick , and include parts of ultraviolet & infrared .
neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016 newton assigned seven colors to the color-continuous rainbow : red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet .
meet roy g. biv neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016most people can take or leave indigo as a rainbow color , but newton was mystically fascinated with 7 , so we re stuck with it .
neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016 and sometimes you will find colors of the rainbow on flags .
pic.twitter.com/fl9ajujank neil degrasse tyson ( @ neiltyson ) june 14 , 2016for that , he also received some nasty pushback : @ neiltyson have you come out of the closet yet ?
# evolutionistscum chuck landreth ( @ charleslandreth ) june 14 , 2016but mostly , he received love : @ neiltyson you , sir , are a true treasure !
i wish you a lifetime of scientific excitement and a never ending supply of rainbows !
70acres ( @ 70acres ) june 15 , 2016 @ neiltyson this sequence was nothing short of elegant .
