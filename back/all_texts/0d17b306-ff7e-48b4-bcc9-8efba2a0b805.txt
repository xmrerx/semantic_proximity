Hillary Clinton often talks about how Donald Trump can be baited with a tweet, and thus he s ill-suited to be President of the United States because he can t be trusted with his Twitter account, let alone the nuclear codes.One Twitter user just tested this theory, and the results were absolutely hilarious.Eric Curtin, otherwise known as @dubsteps4dads on Twitter, is a self-described writer for things and to the rest of us, he s a f*cking genius.He recently tweeted out this series of images that shows his brilliant level of trolling.
And who did he troll?
None other than Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump.Trump doesn t follow many people at all on Twitter, but when Curtin tweeted @realDonaldTrump follow me back so I can DM i have important info about hillary the GOP nominee quickly took the bait and followed him back.What happened next is pure comedy genius.First, came the initial invitation to Trump:Then came the follow by Trump:Followed by the direct message to Trump: Then the immediate block by Trump:Curtin then tweeted out a wrap-up of all that transpired with the simple caption: life comes at you fast.

Not only that, it proves Hillary correct that Trump can very easily be baited with a tweet.
He s also apparently extremely desperate for dirt on Hillary because he followed back a random Twitter account.This is yet another reason Trump can t be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.Featured Photo by Scott Olson, Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images Twitter
