berlin ( reuters ) - chancellor angela merkel s conservatives widened their lead over the social democrats following a television debate in which merkel came across as more convincing and reliable than her spd challenger martin schulz , a poll showed on thursday .
the weekly survey by infratest dimap for ard television showed support for merkel s cdu/csu bloc holding steady at 37 percent while the spd dropped two percentage points to 21 percent - their lowest reading in the poll since early january .
the pollster questioned 1,503 voters from monday to wednesday , meaning the survey was the first fully conducted after sunday s television debate in which hardly any policy differences emerged between merkel and schulz .
the anti-immigration , euro-hostile afd came in unchanged at 11 percent , making it the third-strongest political force .
the radical left followed with 10 percent , up 1 point .
the business-friendly fdp scored 9 percent , also up 1 point , while the environmental greens were unchanged at 8 percent .
the polls indicated two parties fdp and the afd should enter the bundestag as they look set to beat the 5-percent threshold .
the fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between merkel s cdu/csu and the spd .
another scenario could be a tricky three-way jamaica coalition between merkel s conservatives , the fdp and the greens , though such a broad alliance has never been tested on the federal level before .
