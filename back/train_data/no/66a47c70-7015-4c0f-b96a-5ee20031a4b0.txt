abu dhabi ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said on wednesday he wanted to remain firm with iran regarding its ballistic missile program and influence in the middle east , but warned regional countries against exacerbating rising tensions .
the french leader arrived in the united arab emirates on wednesday for a two-day visit that will see him inaugurate a new louvre museum , hold talks on the geopolitical situation with abu dhabi crown prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed al-nahyan , before ending his trip in dubai to attend an economic forum .
in an interview with the government-linked al-ittihad newspaper posted on the french embassy website , macron repeated his country s stance that there was no alternative to the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between iran and world powers .
at the same time , it is also important for us to remain firm with iran with regard to its regional activities and its ballistic missile program , macron was quoted as saying .
with tensions mounting in lebanon following the resignation of prime minister saad al-hariri and an attempted ballistic missile strike on riyadh by houthi rebels in yemen , macron warned about an escalation in the region .
today , more than ever , we need a region of peace and responsible regional actors working for the stability of the middle east , macron said .
the opening of an additional front would only exacerbate tensions and further destabilize the region .
