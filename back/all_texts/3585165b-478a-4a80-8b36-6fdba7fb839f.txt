It s only been a few weeks since CIA veteran Evan McMullin announced that he was joining the presidential race as a conservative Independent candidate, but it s already obvious that he s got it out for Republican nominee Donald Trump.Not only did McMullin blast Trump on Sunday in an interview with ABC s This Week in which McMullin made an extremely strong case for why Trump is not a credible candidate, but he continued his personal crusade against Trump on Monday by live-tweeting the business mogul s foreign policy speech and pointing out every blatant error.During Trump s speech, the GOP nominee basically spewed his usual bigotry he proposed that immigrants be screened through an idealogical test to determine if they can enter the country, spoke about a commission on radical Islam and expressed support for war crimes.
McMullin, just like most of us, was disgusted and shocked by what he was hearing and decided to tweet his reactions as The Donald filled his supporters gullible ears with nonsense.
This is what resulted:TwitterTwitterTwitterMcMullin actually had some really important points to bring up, such as the fact that Trump will basically ruin America s standing with other countries TwitterTwitterTwitterMcMullin also called Trump out for his extreme policies and dictator-like delivery.TwitterTwitterTwitterThe former CIA operative made sure to point out that if voters were looking for a conservative candidate, he was far more qualified than Trump on all counts.
And there s more than enough reason to believe that the GOP will be eager to get behind him, considering that several of the party s more prominent leaders have already condemned and denounced Trump for his inflammatory rhetoric.It seems like McMullin is on a roll and doesn t plan on stopping his attacks on Trump anytime soon.
Just last week, McMullin called Trump an inhuman authoritarian.
Judging from these tweets, things are escalating quickly.Featured image via screenshots
