the anheuser-busch brewery put beer production on hold this week , instead of canning safe drinking water to distribute to flooding victims affected by hurricane harvey.more than 50,000 cans of emergency drinking water will be sent from the brewing company s factory in cartersville , ga. , a spokesperson for anheuser-busch said to fox5.the water will be distributed at red cross shelters in baton rouge , la. , where flash flood watch is in effect through thursday , according to the national weather service .
throughout the year , we periodically pause beer production at our cartersville , ga. , brewery to produce emergency canned drinking water so we are ready to help out communities across the country in times of crisis , said sarah schilling , brewmaster at the anheuser-busch brewery in a statement .
putting our production and logistics strengths to work by providing safe , clean drinking water is the best way we can help in these situations , she said .
fox newsmeanwhile , joel osteen , the pastor of the lakewood megachurch in houston , tx , is being hammered on social for keeping the doors to his church closed to victims of the worst recorded flood in houston s history .
osteen s net worth is valued at over $ 40 million .
in the aftermath of hurricane harvey , joel osteen tweeted to his followers : victoria & i are praying for everyone affected by hurricane harvey .
please join us as we pray for the safety of our texas friends & family .
joel osteen ( @ joelosteen ) august 26 , 2017apparently , many folks on twitter didn t feel as though the pastor , who also happens to be mega-rich , is doing enough to help the people who have supported his luxury lifestyle for years.one twitter user published photos that were allegedly taken in the parking lot of the lakewood megachurch following the massive flooding .
if these pictures are indeed accurate , the lakewood church appears to be unaffected by the flooding.update : joel osteen 's lakewood church in houston is accessible .
their statement it 's inaccessible is a lie .
