the democrats just keep on pushing the fake news of trump colluding with the russians to win the election .
the striking thing is the coordination in talking points .
unreal !
they must email every person to push over and over the same words so we re all brainwashed to believe the lies : earlier in the week , the line was crisis of confidence the democrats are way too predictable ! cnn decided it was a good time to declare a crisis in confidence with the trump administration what a joke !
the firing of comey was nothing of the sort !
when democrats called for coney s firing for months and then trump finally fires him , how can that be a bad thing for democrats ?
it s not they re just playing politics : cnn reported : a president who thrives on crises has created the biggest one yet of his presidency.president trump s decision to fire james comey creates a crisis of confidence around the federal government on a level that most likely hasn t been seen since watergate .
with the tangled threads of russian influence , last year s presidential election and an active fbi investigation , trump s move will test loyalties and force a moment of truth for his republican allies and his justice department.no one is seriously questioning whether the president acted within his authority , and the white house s official explanation for what transpired is straightforward enough .
according to that version of events , the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended comey s ouster , and the president quickly agreed and acted accordingly .
