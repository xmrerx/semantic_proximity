Abdul Razak Ali Artan, a Somalian refugee came to the US in 2014, and he is already a US Citizen.
How does a Muslim refugee from Somalia become a US citizen so quickly?
While others wait in line for years, refugees who come to the US through the State Dept.
sponsored Refugee Resettlement program are given, food stamps, free health-care, free education, housing, a monthly stipend, in many cases, they are given free furniture, and best of all, they are fast-tracked to US citizenship.
What was it that Trump was criticized about again?
Wasn t it something about how we needed to stop the flow of Muslim refugees into America until we can find a better way to vet them?
I m pretty sure most of the students on the OSU campus are rethinking their opposition to Trump s plan after today (at least those who were mowed down by his vehicle or stabbed by the butcher knife he was wielding during his planned attack).
Authorities had previously confirmed that the suspect was a Somali refugee, legally residing in Ohio.Artan fled Somalia with his family in 2007 before landing in Pakistan.He moved to the United States in 2014, where he was granted legal, permanent status.It should be noted that Ohio State s online directory only lists one student with the name, Abdul Artan.Furthermore, The Lantern OSU s campus newspaper ran an interview with Artan just a few months ago, in which he criticized the school for not having Muslim prayer rooms on campus.
I wanted to pray in the open, but I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media, he stated.
I m a Muslim, it s not what the media portrays me to be.
I don t blame them, he continued.
It s the media that put that picture in their heads so they re just going to have it, and it s going to make them feel uncomfortable.
Authorities maintain that the attack was done on purpose and are treating the incident as a possible terrorist act.
DCMedia would like us to believe they are unsure of the motive behind his attack.
