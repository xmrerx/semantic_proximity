she flew in sheryl crow with her band and crew for a 20-minute set .
she special-ordered heart-shaped floral centerpieces , heart-shaped chocolate parfaits , heart-shaped tiramis and , because orange is the charity s color , an orange carpet rather than a red one .
she imported a swiss auctioneer and handed out orange rulers to serve as auction paddles , playfully threatening to use hers to spank the highest bidder for an ibiza vacation.the gala cost $ 363,413 .
