mexico city ( reuters ) - mexicans favor u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton over republican donald trump by a 10-1 ratio , according to a poll .
the poll , conducted by consulta mitofsky and released last week , showed that 2.9 percent of mexicans have a favorable opinion of trump , compared to 30.4 percent for clinton .
the poll comes almost a month after a meeting between trump and mexican president enrique pena nieto in mexico city sparked outrage across the country and led to the resignation of luis videgaray as finance minister .
roy campos , director of the mitofsky polling firm , said mexican interest in the u.s. presidential election signified a change from years past .
“ while in the election of 2008 the interest awakened by [ democratic president barack ] obama was based on approval ... now the interest is because of fear , ” campos said , adding that trump is the least popular u.s. presidential candidate among mexicans in history .
when he announced his candidacy last year , trump said mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the united states and that he would build a wall on the southern u.s. border and make mexico pay for it .
he also has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on mexico , deport millions of migrants and ditch the north american free trade agreement .
the poll , which was conducted between sept. 2 and 5 , surveyed 1,000 mexicans and had a margin of error of 3.1 percent .
