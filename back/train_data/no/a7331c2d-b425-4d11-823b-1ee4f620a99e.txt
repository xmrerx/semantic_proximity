flashback to february 18 .
201 : in a remarkable dispute just two days before a pivotal republican primary , pope francis said donald trump s plan to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border is un-christian , prompting trump to respond that it was disgraceful for the pope to question his religion .
a person who thinks only about building walls , wherever they may be , and not building bridges , is not christian , francis told reporters wednesday aboard the papal plane .
this is not in the gospel .
the pope s comments were first made public on thursday .
they obviously got to the pope , trump said .
he doesn t know me the pope heard only one side of the story .
in response to pope francis comments , candidate trump told his supporters that i am a christian and i am proud of it , and also attacked the mexican government for using the pope as a pawn .
there can t be a good economy without good businessmen , without their capacity to create and to produce , he said , shattering his reputation as an enemy of the free market economy.the pope recognized that the essential value of work and employment is only possible when companies are sound and successful .
moreover , only an economically healthy society can keep a democracy afloat , he suggested .
the world of work is a human priority , francis said , and it s also a priority for the pope .
there s always been a friendship between the church and work , starting with jesus , who was a worker .
when work is weakened , it s democracy that enters into crisis , he said .
there s a social compact .
without denouncing unemployment benefits , francis insisted that state intervention wasn t a real solution .
a monthly check from the state that allows you to keep the family afloat doesn t solve the problem .
it has to be resolved with work for everyone , he said .
