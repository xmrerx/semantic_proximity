remember when rand paul drilled hillary clinton on whether she knew about arms being shipped to jihadists ?
that was a classic moment because her response was a well scripted look of attempted ignorance .
if you know hillary , you know in this moment she was lying her a @ @ off .
it s epic check it out : hillary lies through her teeth while under oath : you would think our republican congress would push harder on this but who knows if people like former congressman mike rodgers ( mi ) might have been involved in the arms shipments .
it has been reported that he had involvement in this.the key thing in all this is that it reveals hillary to be totally incompetent as secretary of state .
it would also be nice if she was prosecuted for perjury i m not holding my breath.via : gateway pundit
