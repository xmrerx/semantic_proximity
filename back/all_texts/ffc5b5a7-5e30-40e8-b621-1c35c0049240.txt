CNN uses their go-to move when they don t like what someone is saying during an interview..they cut you off!
A CNN broadcast Saturday cut off an African-American Trump supporter in the middle of answering a question about white guilt posed by a reporter.
I have seen one shirt that said no white guilt, things like that.
I mean, there have been some messages that might not be that open to folks from diverse perspectives.
What would your message be to folks like that?
Trump supporter Diante Johnson answered, When it comes to no white guilt, I I agree with that, I actually just made a post about it on my page and a video about it There are some White Americans that feel guilty for what their ancestors did, you know, this and that, and the thing about it is, they shouldn t have to feel guilty, this is America The video was then cut off.The reporter continued, Certainly, an interesting perspective there from an African-American who supports Donald Trump and is here today.
The CNN video comes from coverage of a rally held on the National Mall Saturday.Johnson is president of the Black Conservative Federation.Via: Daily Caller
