WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday it supported reviews by Congress of Russian interference into the 2016 U.S. presidential election, saying intelligence agencies have been cooperating closely with lawmakers from both parties.
“We certainly have long supported the principle of congressional review of this matter,” spokesman Josh Earnest told a news briefing.
