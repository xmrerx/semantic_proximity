remember when this would seem like a far-fetched idea ?
democratic presidential front-runner hillary clinton said she loves the idea of appointing barack obama to the supreme court if she s elected president.at a campaign event in iowa tuesday , mrs. clinton told the crowd the next president may have to appoint up to three supreme court justices .
when one attendee mentioned mr. obama as a contender , she seemed excited by the recommendation .
wow , what a great idea .
no one has ever suggested that to me , i love that , wow , mrs. clinton said .
he may have a few other things to do , but i tell you , that s a great idea .
i mean , he s brilliant , he can set forth an argument and he was a law professor , she added .
so he s got all the credentials , but we would have to get a democratic senate to get him confirmed .
