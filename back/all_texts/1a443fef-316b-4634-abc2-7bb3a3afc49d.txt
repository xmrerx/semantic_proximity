On Wednesday, Senator John McCain responded to White House Press Secretary s claim that the massively failed raid in Yemen that left 30 civilians and a Navy SEAL dead, didn t achieve its primary objective, and managed to recover copies of three videos that have been on YouTube for about a decade, a huge success.
According to Spicer, any criticism of the raid which Trump authorized over dinner without adequate planning, preparation, or backup after his staffers goaded him with claims that Obama would not have the cajones to do it is a disservice to the dead.
The life of chief Ryan Owens was done in service to his country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information we received during that raid, Spicer said.
Any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions he took.
Full stop.
McCain disagrees: Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media.
Only emboldens the enemy!
Trump tweeted.
He s been losing so long he doesn t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in bogged down in conflict all over the place.

He's been losing so .

Our hero.. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017..Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a "failure."
Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017You know what emboldens the enemy?
Failing to kill him.
While he did manage to mow down women and children wholesale, Trump s raid missed al Qaeda leader Qassim al-Rimi, the primary target.
Since the raid, al-Rimi has been taunting and mocking Trump in his propaganda videos.
Our hero Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a failure.'
Trump concluded triumphantly.
Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!
It is probably past time for us to get smart and start winning again, but it seems that we will need to wait four years for that.
The raid killed about double the number of civilians as it did militants, the important, game-changing intelligence recovered turned out to be decade-old YouTube videos, he missed his primary target, and Yemen revoked our permission to conduct anti-terrorism operations within their borders.If this is winning in Trump s America, it is time for all of us to be frightened.
Fortunately, The Internet is here to let Trump know what they think of his new, GREAT America where losing is winning and the Ku Klux Klan is not an extremist group.This won t be the last time Trump gets people killed with his impulsive ego-driven mistakes.

@realDonaldTrump Donald, maybe if you pay attention during briefings instead of tweeting about Ivanka's shoes fewer people will die.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump There is no greater tribute to a fallen US soldier than for the idiot who got him killed to use his name in a Twitter fight Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump Jesus Christ.
These tweets make you look like a fucking lunatic.
BenDavid Grabinski (@bdgrabinski) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump you consider the death of one of your soldiers a "win"?
Brilliant.
Ben Pearce (@BenPearceDJ) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump Ryan may have acted heroically but the mission (u decided to send him on over dinner) was an awful failure.
https://t.co/m2eb2fpcv2 Tim Guinee (@TimGuinee) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump Winning!
pic.twitter.com/UAP0CLThAN Letters of Note (@LettersOfNote) February 9, 2017Someone died.
Have some humanity.
Stop using him as a prop piece for your rhetoric.
@realDonaldTrump PORP (@TheOfficialPORP) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump Just imagine if Hillary had called Benghazi a "winning mission" BenDavid Grabinski (@bdgrabinski) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump how dare you politicize the death of a fallen hero I already had a low opinion of you but I'm absolutely disgusted Rob Gorski (@The_Autism_Dad) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump how dare you not even use his full name, show some respect.
You killed Chief Petty Officer William Ryan Owens.

@realDonaldTrump my god, if that's what's considered "winning" or "successful" I think the whole world would prefer you to stop, NOW!
Eloise-at-midnight (@moonatmidnight) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump There is nothing as shameful as a lying draft dodger sending a hero to his death strictly to feed his ego.
You disgust us.
Stupid Should Hurt?
(@stophrtngusa) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump STOP.
TWEETING.
YOU sent Ryan on a bad mission.
It's on you now when our heroes die.
J Throw (@mamathrow) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump nah man you killed a soldier, 30 civilians, and got banned from the country Dolly Doldrums (@_Philosophica) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump While you were asleep in bed.
Your incompetence got a Seal killed and you couldn't care enough to be in Situation Room.
ECMadTown (@ECmadtown) February 9, 2017And to think @realDonaldTrump signed the order at dinner, never monitored op from SitRoom, and was in bed tweeting when it went down.
LOSER!
D E V I N (@DevinMillington) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump an 8 year old was shot in the neck and bled out because of you Derek: Dream Hipster (@AnarchistPrince) February 9, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump You killed 30 civilians, including an American citizen, AND slaughtered an American soldier AND MISSED YOUR TARGET!
Liar Carl Allan Salonen (@CarlASalonen) February 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump How was that a winning mission?
You missed your target, who is now mocking you, & we lost a soldier.
You failed #WhyIResist FarmersCubed (@FarmersCubed) February 9, 2017William Ryan Owens was a hero exactly the sort of hero who deserves a Commander-in-Chief who cares about the lives of our men and women in uniform, a leader who will not place them in unnecessarily dangerous scenarios just to satisfy his ego.
If this is winning, there is only one solution: we need to stop winning.
