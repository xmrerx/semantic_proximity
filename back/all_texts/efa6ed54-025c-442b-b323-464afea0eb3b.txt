BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it is making unremitting efforts on the North Korean nuclear issue, after U.S. President Donald Trump said Beijing had tried but failed to persuade Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear weapons program.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the comment at a daily news briefing.
