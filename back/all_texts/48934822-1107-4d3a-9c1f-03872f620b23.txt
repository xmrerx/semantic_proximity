BARNICLE: So you re asking the Democrats to be as fair as the Republicans were CONWAY: they were very fair.
Excuse me, President Obama had seven of his cabinet members confirmed on January 20, 2009, his inauguration day.
Are you going to guarantee me the same courtesy?
It doesn t sound that way if you read The Hill and the Washington Post, yesterday.
And then he had five more that week.
President Bush had nine his first week.
He had State and Defense and Ag and Commerce and Education and Energy and Treasury.
Are we going to have that?
It doesn t seem that way.
