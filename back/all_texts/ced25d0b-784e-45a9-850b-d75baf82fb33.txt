On Tuesday, our resident Manchurian couch potato met with the head of Chicago s Fraternal Order of Police to talk about the carnage (as Trump calls it) in the city that prompted Trump to send in the feds in January.
Sadly, our police are often prevented from doing their jobs, Trump told union officials at the meeting.
In too many of our communities, violent crime is on the rise.
These are painful realities that many in Washington don t want to talk about.
We have seen it all over.
Trump thanked the union president Dean Angelo for the support he and the union gave during the campaign and, as is custom, took a moment to tell them how much cops love him, describing the numbers in his favor among law enforcement as extremely lopsided.
Then, he said something that would be taken as a joke when uttered by most people but not by someone who installs people in various government offices to serve as loyalty police: I m just trying to figure out the few people who voted the other way.
Who are they?
Who are they?
Find out who they are, please, and let us know.
The room filled with uncertain, muffled, uneasy laughter.Was Trump joking?
Who knows?
After all, ever since he came to power he has treated the act of firing and threatening anyone who disagrees with him as a regular, everyday activity.Watch this extremely uncomfortable moment below:Featured image via Chicago Tribune
