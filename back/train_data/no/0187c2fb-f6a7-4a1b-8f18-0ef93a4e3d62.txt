athens ( reuters ) - residents on the greek island of lesbos went on strike on monday to protest against european policies they say have turned it into a prison for migrants and refugees .
islanders shut businesses , shops , municipal offices , nurseries and pharmacies and dozens rallied on a central square , calling on the government to transfer asylum-seekers to the mainland .
lesbos is not a place of exile , a banner read .
just a few miles from turkey s coast , lesbos has borne the brunt of europe s migrant crisis .
in 2015 , nearly a million people - most fleeing syria , iraq and afghanistan - landed on its shores before heading north , mainly to germany .
it is now hosting some 8,500 asylum-seekers in facilities designed to hold fewer than 3,000 .
lesbos is not an open prison , nor will we allow anyone to view it as such , mayor spyros galinos was quoted as saying by the athens news agency .
thousands of asylum-seekers have become stranded on lesbos and four other islands close to turkey since the eu agreed a deal with ankara in march 2016 to shut down the route through greece .
some have been moved to camps on the mainland , but authorities say the terms of the agreement prevent asylum-seekers from traveling beyond the islands .
rights groups have described conditions in camps across greece as deplorable and unfit for humans .
on lesbos , violence often breaks out over delays in asylum procedures and poor living standards .
the message ( today ) was that we can t take it any more , galinos said .
lesbos is in a state of emergency .
