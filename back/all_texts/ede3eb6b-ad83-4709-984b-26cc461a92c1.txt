During his campaign, Donald Trump promised that he was a friend of the LGBTQ community.
Of course, after watching him stack his campaign and now his cabinet with virulently homophobic and transphobic figures, we all knew that was a steaming pile.
Trump proved us all right on Wednesday, when it was revealed that he and his bigoted administration rolled back the protections for transgender school children that were put in place by the Obama Administration.President Obama was, of course, a fierce champion for LGBTQ equality, and he made sure that transgender people would be protected in public spaces.
Of course, the bigots in the Trump Administration have no intention of doing anything but pandering to the Religious Right, and therefore will be doing all they can to assault this same community.
Well, there s one late night host who has had enough of Trump s bigotry: Late Show host Stephen Colbert.On Thursday night s edition of the show, Colbert employed the use of animated bathroom signs to give Trump and his administration a literal middle finger when it comes to policing genitals and bathrooms.
Of course, it will be a cold day in hell before Trump or anyone on his team would watch such a show, but it sure is nice to have people in prominent positions on the side of those who are arguably the most vulnerable people in our society right now: LGBTQ youth.Watch the amazing clip below, via the Late Show Twitter:The brave souls who point the way to our nation s bathrooms are not taking Trump s rollback of transgender rights lightly.
