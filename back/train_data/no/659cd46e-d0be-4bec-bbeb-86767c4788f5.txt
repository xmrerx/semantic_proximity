( reuters ) - texas governor greg abbott signed into law on wednesday a bill aimed at addressing public pension problems in the state ’ s two biggest cities , dallas and houston .
the new law will increase retirement ages , hike worker and city contributions , limit cost-of-living ( cola ) increases for retirees , and restructure governance .
in a tweet on wednesday , abbott wrote that he was “ proud of the texas legislature leading on pension reform that ensures fiscal soundness. ” the dallas police and fire pension system was projected to become insolvent within 10 years if the city or the state did not act .
the new law cuts the dallas system ’ s nearly $ 3.7 billion unfunded liability to $ 2.18 billion and boosts the funded ratio to nearly 50 percent from the current 36.8 percent , according to a bill analysis .
the houston bill would help reduce the $ 8.1 billion unfunded liability in the city ’ s municipal , police , and firefighter funds by reducing benefits .
the law also lowers the fund ’ s assumed rate of investment return from as high as 8.5 percent , one of the most ambitious rates in the country , to 7.25 percent , closer to nation ’ s average .
the city of houston estimated that without any type of reform , the city would contribute $ 3.7 billion to the pension systems over five years .
with reforms , the city will contribute $ 2.0 billion .
the city estimates a savings of $ 1.4 billion , and an estimated debt service cost of $ 0.2 billion .
