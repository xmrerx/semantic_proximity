According to the mother of the 35 year old murdered woman, this maggot had tried to murder her before.
But in Obama s eyes he didn t present any danger to the community.
Hmmm I wonder if those were his two girls if he might feel differently?Obama s early release program is going to work as expected.
A cocaine dealer who received early release murdered his ex-girlfriend and her two children.
He now faces the death penalty.Criminals already plea down their cases and now thanks to Obama they get to plea and plea again.Wendell Callahan, 35, murdered Erveena Hammonds, 32, Anaesia Green, 10, and Breya Hammonds, 7.He slaughtered them, stabbed them brutally in their home in Columbus, Ohio in January.Once sentenced to 12 1/2 years, he had 4 years shaved off his sentence in two guideline changes.He also stabbed Hammonds current boyfriend Curtis Miller who showed up while Callahan was still in the apartment.
Callahan was stabbed himself in the fight with MillerCallahan s mother said no one has talked to her son about what happened since he is in the hospital.
Typical enabling mother and we have an enabling president.There were many witnesses and the children throats were slit.
They were in the first and fifth grades.In 2006, he tried to call her.
Hammonds said that he had beaten and choked her so severely that she thought he would have killed her if (a) good Samaritan didn t pass by.
But he was good in prison and presented no threat to the public.
He s one of those low level offenders Obama wants free to roam our streets.No threat?
He tried to kill her in 2006!Callahan s idiotic mother said,His mother, however, said the murder accusations were out of character.
He wouldn t do that to her and her kids, she said.She raised a sociopath by making excuses for him.Via: Independent Sentinel
