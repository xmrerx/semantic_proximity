WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, one of the most prominent critics of President Donald Trump, said on Tuesday he was out of step with his party and would not seek re-election.
“There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party,” Flake, whose term ends in 2018, told the Arizona Republic.
Flake added that he would not run as an independent.
