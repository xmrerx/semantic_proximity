Anderson Cooper decided it would be a good idea to roll his eyes numerous times during his interview with Kellyanne Conway Not smart!The cameras caught his eye rolls Classless move!
Conway responded by calling his move sexist .
We have to agree because you know he wouldn t pull this move with anyone else.
Conway has been just one more person the left has targeted with their slings and arrows.
It s not professional critique but nasty and very sophomoric comments about anything from the way Conway dresses to her physical appearance.
It s been brutal but she s such a strong woman that she just keeps bringing great commentary.
We say BRAVO!The disrespect is unbelievable!
