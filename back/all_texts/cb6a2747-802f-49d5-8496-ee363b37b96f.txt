On Sunday, House Speaker Paul Ryan stated that he feels he must support Donald Trump as the Republican Pary s presidential nominee, due to his position in Congress and the Party.
During an interview on NBC s Meet the Press, Ryan told Chuck Todd, I feel like I have certain responsibilities as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as Speaker of the House.
Ryan continued, saying: Imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress.
Ryan then went on to add a caveat to his duty-bound support for Trump.
Now having said that, if something is done and said that I don t agree with, that I think puts a bad label on conservatism then I m going to speak out on it as I have, as I will continue to do.
And I hope I don t have to keep doing it.
Ryan is indirectly commenting on his recent condemnation of Trump s racist rhetoric.Todd then pointed out that Ryan is choosing his party over what is best for the U.S. You just made a case though of party over country.
No, I didn t, Ryan replied.
I know Hillary Clinton won t agree with anything we want to do.
She ll put a bad judge on the Supreme Court, she won t agree with any of the conservative reforms we are trying to do.
Ryan s statement was an appeal to putting party politics over the nation s interests.
Ryan s Trump is better than Clinton talking point isn t going to cover that up.
The majority of the GOP has decided to back Trump as their new elephant overlord, despite their division on his policy proposals.
Ryan is no different, even though he is trying to posture himself as a voice of reason against Trump s rhetoric in the GOP.
That isn t possible to do with any credibility.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screenshot
