really hillary ?
why don t you tell us about men who are offensive to women donald trump s remarks about fox news anchor megyn kelly are offensive , but the rest of the republican field is equally offensive , democratic presidential front-runner hillary rodham clinton said monday .
what donald trump said about megyn kelly is outrageous , but what the rest of the republicans are saying about all women is also outrageous , clinton said .
they brag about slashing health-care funding , they say they would force women who have been raped to carry their rapist s child , and fail to put forward proposals that would help women earn equal pay .
i think the guy went way overboard .
offensive , outrageous , pick your adjective , clinton told reporters following a campaign event here focused on making college more affordable .
* ( * she really meant forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for free college for every american and illegal alien as a means for her to get the youth vote ) via : washington postand then there s that whole underage sex scandal where bill was named as being an active participant with pedophile pal and donor , jeffrey epstein by former teen sex slave .
no war on women here
