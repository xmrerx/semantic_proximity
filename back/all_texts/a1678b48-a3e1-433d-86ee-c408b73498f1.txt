Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto was scheduled to meet with Trump on January 31, but that isn t happening anymore.
Via Twitter, Pe a Nieto announced that this morning we informed the White House that I will not attend the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday.
Esta ma ana hemos informado a la Casa Blanca que no asistir a la reuni n de trabajo programada para el pr ximo martes con el @POTUS.
Enrique Pe a Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017This cancellation is unsurprising, following Trump s decision to move forward with his stupid f*cking wall and his even more ridiculous claim that Mexico will somehow pay for it and, of course, directly following Trump s tweet that indicated Mexico should cancel the meeting if they refuse to pay for the wall:The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico.
It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017of jobs and companies lost.
If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017 Mexico does not believe in walls.
I ve said it time and time again: Mexico will not pay for any wall, Nieto said in a video published Wednesday.Un mensaje para todos los mexicanos: pic.twitter.com/EFcNh7fQtm Enrique Pe a Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017 I ve asked for the minister of Foreign Relations to re-enforce protection measures to our citizens, he said in the video, adding that 50 Mexican Consulates in the United States will be used to protect the rights of immigrants from Donald Trump.President Asterisk and Pe a Nieto met once during Trump s campaign.
After a brief joint public appearance, Nieto tweeted that At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.
His position has not changed since then, and it likely will not.Featured image via screengrab
