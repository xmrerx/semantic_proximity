If there s one thing we all know for certain, and one thing we can all unite behind, it s the fact that this year s election cycle is absolutely bonkers.
Especially on the Republican side.While the Democrats have two very solid choices for Commander-in-Chief, and it literally comes down to style of leadership and policy positions (as it should), the Republicans are left with two choices that are the equivalent to choosing which venereal disease you d rather put up with.
They re pretty f*cking awful.Noticing how crazy this year s election has become was none other than the insurance company Esurance.
And in a brilliant April Fool s Day prank that may actually win the day, they put together an entire commercial dedicated to selling election insurance.
They begin by posing the question: This November, anything could happen.
Are you covered?
Then they go through why you will likely need to leave home and move to Canada, and will need an insurance policy to protect your home for at least the next four years.By the end, they end with: The smart way to protect your home after you abandon it.
And while it may be only a joke, it s really not a half bad idea.To avoid the feeling that you may need to move, remember to vote blue no matter who.Protect your home in case of a sudden move to another country with #ElectionInsurance.https://t.co/DvuXMnK0KJ Esurance (@esurance) March 31, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
