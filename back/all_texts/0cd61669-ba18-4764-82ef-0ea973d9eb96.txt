Things just keep going from bad to worse in regards to everything coming out of the Donald Trump campaign.
If he s not being a racist blowhard or blaming the media for himself being a douchebag, then he s throwing insults around like a schoolyard bully who doesn t have any friends.Now, on top of the many, MANY misspelled tweets coming from the Trump campaign, misspellings so bad even the Merriam-Webster dictionary felt compelled to call him out on them, he now can t even spell the name of one of his key endorsements properly on his website.As we all know by now, Donald Trump embraced Sarah Palin s bombastic personality full-on.
Likely because the pair goes together like peas and carrots.
Neither have the experience to run for any sort of public office, but both feel just because they are loud and inappropriate that should be enough to get bigots to the polls to vote.
However, as much as Trump seems to love having Palin s endorsement, he and his staff couldn t take the time to spell her name correctly:via donaldjtrump.com As we all know, Palin spells her name Sarah not Sara and you d think if Trump respected Palin as much as he says he does, he would ve at least taken the time to spell her name properly.Is this a big deal?
No, but considering this just continues to fit the pattern of Trump s inability to spell, it makes you wonder if he s even capable of tying his own shoes, let alone run the nation.Featured image: YouTube
