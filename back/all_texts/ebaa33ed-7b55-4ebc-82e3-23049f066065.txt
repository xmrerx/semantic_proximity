Harry Reid has had just about enough of the refusal of the leaders of the Republican Party to disavow their support of Donald Trump.
The Senate Minority Leader slammed his colleagues on the other side House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in particular for refusing to un-endorse their presidential nominee, even as he attacks the mother of a fallen American soldier.Reid issued a blistering missive against Ryan and McConnell, saying: Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan approvingly spoke at Donald Trump s convention, endorsed Donald Trump for president and believe he is mentally fit to sit in the Oval Office.
Occasional statements that do nothing to repudiate Donald Trump s words and actions are spineless.
Anything short of revoking their endorsements is cowardice.This shouldn t be hard.
Donald Trump is a sexist and racist man who insults Gold Star parents, stokes fear of Muslims and sows hatred of Latinos.
He should not be president and Republican leaders have a moral responsibility to say so .
Senator Reid is right.
Donald Trump has run his campaign on increasingly dangerous rhetoric that taps into the deepest, basest instincts in his blind followers.
Now, he has escalated those attacks to a family of the fallen, just because they had the audacity to call out his disgusting anti-Muslim bigotry.
Kzir Khan was right.
Donald Trump has sacrificed nothing and no one for this great country.
All he has done is make a complete and utter mockery of our election process and run the most outrageously offensive presidential campaign we have ever seen.Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell, if you have any integrity, morals, values, or love of country at all, you will not continue to push to make this shameful excuse for a presidential candidate our Commander-in-Chief.
He is clearly unfit to hold that office.
It s time to put country before party.
For once in your sorry careers, do the right thing.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
