the news that the forecast for the third quarter gdp is set to expand to 4.0 will be bad news for the democrats who are trying to take down president trump .
it will be ignored by the mainstream media who are focused on statues and protests.this should be great news for trump s economic team of brilliant and successful businessmen but even greater news for all americans !
maga ! reuters reported : the u.s. economy is on track to expand at a 4.0 percent annualized pace in the third quarter with inventory investment contributing 1.12 percentage points to growth , the atlanta federal reserve s gdp now forecast model showed on thursday.last friday , the government said its first reading on the gross domestic product in the second quarter was a 2.6 percent growth pace , which was 0.2 point below atlanta fed s final estimate.a pro-growth president finally ! president trump has unleashed the beast !
pro-growth and less regulation within industry in america has allowed our economy to nearly double the gdp within the president s first year amazing ! the coal industry is back along with the steel industry .
ripping away unnecessary regulations is the key to growth .
trump knows how to get america back to work and how to help industry do that.while the left protests pretty much everything trump wins ! when president trump was campaigning to make america great again , so many of us understood that this meant bringing back growth to our economy .
a successful america is great for everyone !
those who don t have a political agenda understand this is a win-win no matter who you are.this is exactly why trump won !
