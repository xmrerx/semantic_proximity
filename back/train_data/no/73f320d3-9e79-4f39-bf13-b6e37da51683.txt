paris ( reuters ) - france s national assembly ( lower house of parliament ) will vote to adopt a counter-terrorism bill on tuesday , including measures to increase police and intelligence agency powers when there is a security threat or reason to believe an attack is planned .
the bill , still subject to amendments but expected to be definitively approved by mid-october , will transpose into law several powers granted to the police and other agencies under a state of emergency that began in november 2015 , after the islamist attacks in paris that killed 130 people .
the state of emergency , the most sweeping anti-terrorism powers in europe , will expire at the end of october .
below is an outline of the measures that will come into force if the bill passes into law .
human rights and legal experts have raised concerns about the sweep of the proposals , including the fact that in some cases the interior ministry would be able to act without judicial oversight .
under the proposals , the legislation would remain in place until at least 2021 , and the government will have to report to parliament annually on how it is using the new powers .
* * the interior ministry would have the power to designate public spaces as security zones for up to a month , limiting who could enter and leave ( both vehicles and people ) and with wide powers to stop and search within the perimeter .
private security guards , under police supervision , would be granted similar stop and search powers .
* * the interior ministry would have the power to shut down places of worship if there are suspicions that they are being used to propagate hate speech or incitement to violence , to provoke acts of terrorism or to justify terrorist acts .
the closures could be for up to six months , with the religious sites having 48 hours to lodge an appeal with judicial authorities against the decision .
* * the interior ministry would have the power to limit the movement of people considered a national security threat .
the individual administrative control and surveillance measures would compel a person to remain in a defined geographic area , report to the police three times a week , report any change of residence and potentially submit to an electronic surveillance bracelet .
* * the interior ministry , with approval from a judge , would have the freedom to search private property and seize documents , objects or goods if there is a suspicion of terrorist activity being planned or to prevent a terrorist act being carried out .
