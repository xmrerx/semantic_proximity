WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was prepared for a military option in handling the North Korea nuclear crisis but warned it would have dire consequences for the Communist country.
We are totally prepared for the second option, not a preferred option, Trump said at a White House news conference.
But if we take that option, it will be devastating, I can tell you that, devastating for North Korea.
That s called the military option.
If we have to take it, we will.
