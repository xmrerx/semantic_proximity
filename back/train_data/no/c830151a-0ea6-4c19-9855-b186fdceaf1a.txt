a huge number of federal employees wouldn t be able to stand their jobs if republican presidential front-runner donald trump won the next presidential election .
according to a survey done by the government business council , a quarter of government employees find trump so unbearably repulsive that they would actually quit.the breakdown revealed that 14 % of workers surveyed would definitely jump ship , and 11 % stated that they d consider leaving their jobs resulting in a potential 25 % of federal employees terminating their positions .
it could be disastrous , when you imagine all the government agencies such as the post office and our va system which are normally understaffed to begin with trying to function with 25 % fewer people .
the results of trump s presidency could be damaging on every level.when broken down by party , 42 % of democrats said they d consider leaving , compared to just 8 % of republicans .
the survey also revealed that regardless of their political party , almost 60 % of federal employees admitted they d be embarrassed to call trump their boss .
this was much higher than any of the democratic candidates such as hillary clinton ( 49 % ) and bernie sanders ( 37 % ) .to make matters even more embarrassing for the gop , survey participants were also asked how they felt about their current boss , president barack obama and the majority ( 56 % ) of democratic employees said they would be honored to support him for a third term ( if he was permitted one ) .so while donald trump might continue to be popular in the polls , this study reveals that many americans are still level-headed and quite humiliated by the idea that he might be given the chance to lead this country .
you can t get a much clearer sign than 1 in 4 people quitting their jobs to demonstrate just how vile the idea of trump in the white house is.this poll was conducted at the end of january , and used data from 688 federal employees with a margin of error give or take four percentage points .
of those surveyed , 42 % called themselves republicans , 31 % identified as democrats , while 8 % said they did not know and 19 % wouldn t state their party.featured image via gage skidmore
