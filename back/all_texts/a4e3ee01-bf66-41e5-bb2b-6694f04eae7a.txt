Civil rights icon, Rep. John Lewis, recently announced that while he has attended every presidential inauguration for three decades, he s going to forego the dubious pleasure of attending Donald Trump s. Lewis says that Trump, who received the benefit of a hostile foreign government s team of hackers, propagandists, and a massive fake news campaign headed by often-shirtless, journalist-killing, homophobic leader of said nation, is not a legitimate president and that The Donald is all talk, talk, talk no action or results.
In response to Lewis remarks, Trump decided to spend the weekend preceding Martin Luther King Day hate-trolling a man who was violently beaten in Selma while fighting for equality.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Just to put things in perspective, Trump s father was arrested at a Ku Klux Klan rally and the only thing Trump has ever done for black people is to make a Tyler Perry movie come to life by giving these two idiots attention:On Saturday, Trump continued his assault on Lewis, urging the Congressman to finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S.
Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S.
I can use all the help I can get!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017As was expected, the Internet had Lewis back:.
@realDonaldTrump Also, sweetheart, the portrait you're painting of "inner cities" does not make it seem like you've ever been there.

@realDonaldTrump His district is fine.
In fact a large portion of it is suburbs.
You are stereotyping & perpetuating racial stereotypes.

You wonder why black America doesn't connect with you?
You're attacking an MLK associate Sharika Soal (@LadyThriller69) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump wow you're really doubling down on this, huh.

@realDonaldTrump You HAVE a lot to learn from John Lewis.
He's a civil rights icon who was arrested and beaten so people could vote.
pic.twitter.com/hbu5QWexYG Kristina Wong (@mskristinawong) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump you lost today, buddy.
America loves John Lewis a lot more than you.
Just put your phone down and call it a night Michael Skolnik (@MichaelSkolnik) January 15, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump After Trump's tweets, sales of John Lewis's graphic novel "spiked by 106,700%," and sales of his memoir jumped 56,750%.
Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump "finally"?
He's spent his life fighting for justice.
Yashar (@yashar) January 15, 2017@Green_Footballs @realDonaldTrump No we didn't.
We chose Hillary.
The system gave us this.
Thanks fly over country.
CBQUE94 (@CBOD14) January 15, 2017This guy deserves a trophy:@realDonaldTrump while you tweet, insult ppl & stiff contractors, @repjohnlewis has committed his life to making America more equal for all.
Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump further you have been an inner-city real estate developer for your entire life, but have done NOTHING to help inner-cities.
Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump your tweets demonstrate that as a white-heterosexual-"1 percenter" you have NO understanding of struggle for civil rights.
Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump for DECADES, you haven't even fulfilled your charitable commitments how people trust you to lead is beyond me.
#NoMorals Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump while @RepJohnLewis was fighting for voting rights, healthcare & education, YOU were busy peddling bitherism > #fakenews!
Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump you're not half the man @repjohnlewis is.
You HIDE behind Twitter.
You are only concerned w/ building your Trump fiefdom.
Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump final point: @repjohnlewis is a role model for our kids.
In the 1960s, Lewis made USA great by tackling her greatest stain.
Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) January 15, 2017On Monday, we celebrate the life of one of the greatest civil rights figures to ever live.
On Friday, the nation will mourn as we watch a man who will attempt to undo everything King (and Lewis) fought for.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images and screengrab
