Kyle s own words: So for those of you who don t know, this past Friday (12.16.2016) I was given the diagnosis I didn t want to hear.
It seems that I have stage 4 glioblastoma.
It s a very aggressive type of brain cancer.
Currently, there is no cure, but there is a chance.
The doctor said it all depends on how hard we go after it, and how my body responds to the treatment.
I fully believe that God is still in the miracle-making business as well!
I m putting complete trust in God and I know regardless of the outcome, I ll be healed one way or another!
Please continue to keep me in your thoughts and prayers.
Thanks ya ll!
