vietnam has supposedly made modest gains in reducing human rights abuses but a catholic priest was just released after two decades in a vietnam prison .
what on earth did this priest do ?
well , he fought for religious freedom yes , vietnam is still holding others in situations just like this .
soooo vietnam throws us a bone and releases just one prisoner as a gesture so obama will lift the arms ban ?
why not hold out for all political prisoners ? vietnam has freed one of its longest-serving political prisoners , just a few days before a visit by barack obama in which human rights is expected to be a key talking point.nguyen van ly , a catholic priest who has spent most of the past two decades in detention due to his relentless pursuit of democracy and religious freedom , was released from a prison in central hue province after his fourth stint behind bars .
they released him in a special amnesty by vietnam s president before the obama trip , catholic priest phan van loi told reuters by phone.the communist country s state-controlled media has made no mention of ly s release , which comes as obama weighs whether to lift an arms embargo on vietnam , a decision washington has long said would hinge on human rights progress.loi said that he met ly after his release and that although he appeared weak , he was in high spirits.the us embassy in hanoi welcomed the release of ly but said other dissidents should be freed too .
we call on the government to release unconditionally all prisoners of conscience and allow all vietnamese to express their political views peacefully without fear of retribution , an embassy spokesman said.during ly s long periods of incarceration , sometimes in solitary confinement , he suffered numerous health problems , including strokes and partial paralysis.ly s release on friday was three months before the end of an eight-year prison sentence for anti-state propaganda , which comes under a section of the criminal code that rights groups say is vaguely worded and used to punish outspoken critics.the priest has been on the receiving end of some of the country s harshest verdicts , stemming from his opposition to the political monopoly of the communist party .
he set up a pro-democracy movement and was behind several banned publications.human rights is a thorny issue for vietnam that has created dilemmas for western governments keen to engage with one of asia s fastest-growing economies but alarmed by the arrests , harassment and jailing of its detractors.via : the guardian
