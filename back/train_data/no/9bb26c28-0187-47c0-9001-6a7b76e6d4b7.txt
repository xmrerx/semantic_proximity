beirut ( reuters ) - an air raid in the government-held qusur district of deir al-zor city in eastern syria killed more than a dozen people , syrian state television and a war monitor said on monday .
state television said jets from a u.s.-led international coalition battling islamic state carried out the air strike and that it killed 14 civilians and wounded 32 others .
a spokesman for the coalition said on tuesday it had not carried out such a raid , and that its only strike in the vicinity in recent weeks took place in september across the euphrates from the city .
the war monitor , the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights , reported that it was not known which aircraft carried out the strike , but that at least 22 people were killed .
the syrian army , backed by russia , iran and shi ite militias , is fighting islamic state in the city of deir al-zor , as well as in parts of the surrounding countryside .
both syrian and russian jets have been hitting islamic state in that area .
the u.s.-backed coalition has been conducting air strikes against islamic state in support of the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) alliance of kurdish and arab militias to the east of deir al-zor across the euphrates .
the rival u.s.-backed and syrian army offensives against islamic state have clashed several times over recent months as they have pushed the jihadists from territory in eastern syria .
the u.s. and russia have said they communicate with each other to prevent possible points of conflict of violence between the two offensives .
