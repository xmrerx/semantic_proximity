Amateur president Donald Trump has avoided doing any real work while only being on the job for just over one month.
The 70-year-old has taken several vacations, though, and his trips to his extravagant resort Mar-a-Lago have cost the taxpayers dearly.
Just after winning the election, Trump went on a thank you tour.
Later, after taking the oath of office, the thin-skinned alleged president held a rally in Florida.
Trump needs his ego fed daily.
With abysmally low approval ratings and finding himself plagued with scandals, Trump wants his supporters to throw a rally in his honor.
Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally.
It would be the biggest of them all!, he tweeted to his 25.5 million followers.Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally.
It would be the biggest of them all!

Alex Leo (@AlexMLeo) February 25, 2017And it is extremely nice for Donald Trump to give Three Doors Down and Alabama a chance to work again at a rally.
MAGAGAGAGA!!!
Frog frog!

Matt Haig (@matthaig1) February 25, 2017Trump has been silent about this murderer..@realDonaldTrump still no comment on this murderer who shot & killed an Indian and wounded 2 others after saying "Get out of my country."

:o @realDonaldTrump Steven Bonnell II (@OmniDestiny) February 25, 2017Trump launched a war on U.S. Intelligence agencies and the press.
It looks like the amateur POTUS needs a safe place.
@realDonaldTrump You are the biggest snowflake.
Get criticized: hold a rally with your sycophants.
Need a presidential safe space, pumpkin?
Aaron Gouveia (@DaddyFiles) February 25, 2017Trump is Making America Embarrassed Again.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe next time you should delete a tweet like this and just find someone to hug you instead.
This is EMBARRASSING MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) February 25, 2017A reminder to the Whiner-in-Chief.
@realDonaldTrump This is America.
We don't have rallies for leaders we've elected.
That's why we have elections.
Scott Monty (@ScottMonty) February 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Lincoln won roughly 40% of the popular vote, but I don't recall him whining about the election.
He had work to do.
Kevin M. Levin (@KevinLevin) February 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump if you're that desperate for a crowd, let me assure you the attendance at your impeachment hearings will be YUGE.

MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) February 25, 2017Size matters.
Lol.
@realDonaldTrump Your obsession with size is very telling.

@realDonaldTrump why not focus on your job, #BenedictTrump ?

Trump unleashes mean-girl tweets to distract the public from what s really going on.
Many times he tweets our self-praise while patting himself on the back.
In this case, he has to know that another rally won t make him look presidential but it s a great tool to distract us from what s taking place.
The White House conveniently banned selective members of the press yesterday and that s because of the new reports on his ties to Russia.Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images.
