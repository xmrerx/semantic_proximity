rabat ( reuters ) - morocco s king dismissed several ministers and top officials on tuesday for failing to improve the economic situation in a region shaken by protests , a statement said .
protests erupted in the rif region around the northern city of al-hoceima last october , triggered by the death of a fishmonger whose produce was confiscated by police .
the man s crushing to death in a garbage truck during a confrontation with police became a symbol of corruption and official abuse .
protests , also fueled by economic underdevelopment , continued there this year .
morocco s king mohammed dismissed the ministers of education , planning and housing and health , as well as other officials , after an economic agency found imbalances in implementing a development plan , state news agency map reported , citing a palace statement .
political protests are rare in morocco , where the palace remains the ultimate power .
the protests , the largest in morocco since the days of the 2011 arab spring , were directed at the government and the king s entourage rather than the monarch himself .
the king s move came as protest leader nasser zefzafi and 29 others accused of organizing demonstrations in the northern region went on trial in casablanca .
they face charges ranging from conspiring against the state to protesting without authorization .
zefzaki s lawyer told reuters he could be sentenced to death in a worst-case scenario .
the judge adjourned the session until oct 31 .
zefzaki s supporters protested in front of the court while some 70 lawyers attended the trial .
the protest movement was born after fikri s death .
police confiscated fish they said he had bought illegally and dumped it in a garbage truck .
desperate to recover his stock , fikri jumped inside and was killed by a rubbish crusher .
in july the king pardoned dozens of people arrested in the protests and blamed the failure of local officials to quickly implement development projects for stoking public anger .
