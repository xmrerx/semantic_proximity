A group of White Lives Matter protestors held a protest outside of the building of the Houston chapter of the NAACP on Sunday morning.
Members of the group indicated that they were angry that the NAACP has not spoken out against the Black Lives Matter movement.
We came out here to protest against the NAACP and their failure in speaking out against the atrocities that organizations like Black Lives Matter and other pro-black organizations have caused the attack and killing of white police officers, the burning down of cities and things of that nature, a member of the White Lives Matter group said.
If they re going to be a civil rights organization and defend their people, they also need to hold their people accountable.
During the protest, protestors carried assault rifles and other firearms, as well as a giant Confederate flag.
We re not out here to instigate or start any problems, Reed said.
Obviously we re exercising our Second Amendment rights but that s because we have to defend ourselves.
Their organizations and their people are shooting people based on the color of their skin.
We re not.
We definitely will defend ourselves, but we re not out here to start any problems.
We came here because the NAACP headquarters is here and that s one of the most racist groups in America, a protestor named Scott Lacey said.Police eventually arrived at the protest and created a barricade.
No one was harmed during the protest, except anyone who still had an ounce left of faith in humanity.You can watch a video report about the protest below.Featured image via video screenshot
