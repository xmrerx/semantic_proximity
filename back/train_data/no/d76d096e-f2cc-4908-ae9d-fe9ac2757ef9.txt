hillary s campaign has been working in coordination with the mainstream media for months to hide donald j. trump s popularity with the everyday americans hillary claims to be a champion of .
pennsylvania is one state the democrat party would never have believed would be in jeopardy only one month before the election , but then again , they never expected the mass appeal trump would have with middle america who want their country back and the jobless who want to be contributing members of our society again .
we all basically want the same thing , to make america great again and that is why the democrats are about to lose pa nearly 100,000 pennsylvania democrats have switched to republican since the beginning of the year.what s more : the pennsylvania republican party says more than 240-thousand new voters have joined the party since last november.the state republican party says that the surge in republican registrations is nearly twice the number of newly registered republicans compared to both the 2008 and 2012 numbers combined.combine this stunning development with the emergence of the amish vote and the coal miners who are supporting trump after hillary promised to take away their jobs , and you ve got a blue state that has a very high probability of turning red !
