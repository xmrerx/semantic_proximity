Michelle Obama has been wearing some interesting fashion choices during her overseas trip to Italy.
To each his own but the latest outfit crossed over the line because it was disrespectful to the religious guests of Siena Cathedral.
Women are supposed to cover their shoulders upon entry into the cathedral.
Who does that?Rules must be for the little people and not for the Obamas Sienna, Tuscany is one of the stops for the Obamas on their trip to Italy.
