Our weekly documentary film, curated by our editorial team at 21WIRE.
EDITORS NOTE: At times, this film might sanitise the CIA infamous operation in Southeast Asia, just short of glorifying it, but the detail and over view of this piece of history is extremely education especially when you consider how similar operations are doing the exact same operation in Turkey, Pakistan and Yemen.
From its origins with the legendary Flying Tigers of WWII to the final days of the Vietnam War, the covert program of Air America is one of the most clandestine operations in CIA history.
