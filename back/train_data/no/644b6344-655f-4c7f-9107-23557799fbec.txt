washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. supreme court on tuesday rejected a challenge by procter & gamble co and other companies to the way california imposes taxes on businesses that operate in multiple states .
the justices left in place a december 2015 ruling by the california supreme court that california is not bound by a 1967 agreement between states that set a formula for calculating taxes .
california , which joined the multistate tax compact in 1974 , changed the formula in 1993 .
california has since withdrawn from the state compact .
several companies , including two procter & gamble subsidiaries , kimberly-clark worldwide inc and merck kgaa subsidiary sigma-aldrich corp , sued in 2010 after being denied refunds for the tax they paid between 1993 and 2005 .
the companies said they overpaid their taxes by $ 34 million .
lawyers for the companies had said $ 750 million in potential tax refunds in california and additional amounts in other states were at stake in the case .
many states have moved away from the multistate tax compact formula .
to favor and attract businesses within their borders , these states have rearranged the way they tax business income so that in-state businesses pay less and out-of-state businesses pay more .
