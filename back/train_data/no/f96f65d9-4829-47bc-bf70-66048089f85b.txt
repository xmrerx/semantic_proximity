private jets , lots of cash , presidential suites you name it !
unreal ! late last month an ib times report showed that goldman sachs paid bill clinton some $ 200,000 for a speech ahead of an effort to lobby the state department ( then led by hillary clinton ) on export-import bank legislation tied to a $ 75 million purchase order from a chinese company to a goldman-owned aircraft manufacturer.the idea that the paid speech and the authorization of an export-import bank loan to the chinese firm were related was of course dismissed as preposterous by goldman ( draw your own conclusions ) but what certainly isn t preposterous is the fact that the clintons reap millions for speaking engagements and as you can see from the following , if you want a clinton , a quarter-million in cash isn t all you ll need to budget for.the full list is here : hillary speaking feesas a reminder , hillary is running for everyday americans .
