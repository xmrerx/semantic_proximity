ankara ( reuters ) - turkey is launching an initiative at the united nations to annul a decision by the united states to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital , president tayyip erdogan said on friday .
erdogan was speaking two days after a muslim leaders meeting in istanbul condemned u.s. president donald trump s decision , calling on the world to respond by recognizing east jerusalem as the capital of palestine .
we will work for the annulment of this unjust decision firstly at the un security council , and if a veto comes from there , the general assembly , erdogan told crowds gathered in the central anatolian city of konya via teleconference .
the united states is a permanent security council member with veto powers , meaning any move to overturn washington s decision at the council would certainly be blocked .
jerusalem , revered by jews , christians and muslims alike , is home to islam s third holiest site and has been at the heart of the israeli-palestinian conflict for decades .
israel captured arab east jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally .
trump s decision broke with decades of u.s. policy and international consensus that the city s status must be left to israeli-palestinian talks , leading to harsh criticisms from muslim countries and israel s closest european allies , who have also rejected the move .
a communique issued after wednesday s summit of more than 50 muslim countries , including u.s. allies , said they considered trump s move to be a declaration that washington was withdrawing from its role as sponsor of peace in the middle east .
asked about the criticism during an interview with israel s makor rishon daily , the u.s. ambassador to israel said trump had done what is good for america .
president trump ... does not intend to reverse himself , despite the various condemnations and declarations , ambassador david friedman said .
