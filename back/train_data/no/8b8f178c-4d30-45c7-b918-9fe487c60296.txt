johannesburg ( reuters ) - zimbabwe president robert mugabe should end his attempts to remain in office after the military seized power this week as he has no regional diplomatic support to stay in power , botswana president ian khama said on friday .
the military intervention , which political sources say could pave the way to a national unity government after 37 years of mugabe rule , also presented an opportunity to put zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity , khama told reuters .
i don t think anyone should be president for that amount of time .
we are presidents , we are not monarchs .
it s just common sense , khama said .
