trump and his whole team should be disqualified from the presidency after this.donald trump continued sucking up to russia on friday by openly siding with russia and vladimir putin over news outlets in the united states while singling out fox news as the lone media outlet that has sold out america in support of trump and his russian friends.russians are playing @ cnn and @ nbcnews for such fools funny to watch , they don t have a clue !
@ foxnews totally gets it !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 30 , 2016this is pretty damn serious because it demonstrates that trump will always side with russia against american businesses , media outlets , the intelligence community , and government officials if they continue to criticize or oppose him.rooting against american media while praising one of our enemies amounts to treason and twitter users absolutely went nuclear on trump for doing just that .
@ realdonaldtrumpit s killing you isn t it ?

matthewdicks ( @ matthewdicks ) december 31 , 2016donald trump is unfit to be president .
he has proven that time and time again , and he just made it clear again today .
he intends to side with russia over america and his obsession with putin is terrifying.russia is clearly going to use trump like a puppet and if the american people don t want putin to control the white house , now is the time to do something about it.featured image : photo of donald trump by joe raedle/getty images .
