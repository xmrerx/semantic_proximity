Donald Trump s presidential campaign has been trying hard to convince the media and (white) voters that he is wholeheartedly making an appeal to black voters.
But in reality the Trump attempt to speak about the issues that black Americans have been insulting and ham-fisted at best.Taking that into consideration, Conan O Brien broadcast an ad poking fun at what Trump outreach to black voters would really look like:Like the real Trump campaign s efforts, the hilarious ad comes across more as something that a white person who has never interacted with a black person would come up with.
It starts out echoing Trump in the way he has argued that black people have terrible lives, then ratchets up to point out different ways that Trump could pander to black voters including appointing Denzel Washington to run the FAA.The comedic bit points out how bad the actual Trump work has been, showcasing just how little attention Trump gives to how real black Americans are dealing with life.
Instead, Trump treats these voters as simpletons who are looking to him to be their savior.
His pitch has literally been to ask black voters what else they have to lose, a far cry from a positive sales job.And black voters are understandably not responding to the Trump come-on.
Polls show that Trump is on track to have less black vote support in the election than either John McCain or Mitt Romney did in their elections, although President Obama was on the ballot in those contests.Some polling in swing states has shown Trump polling at zero percent with black voters.
They have largely been turned off by a campaign using the most nakedly racist appeals seen in such an effort since the pro-segregation Dixiecrat party was a player in the 1960s.Featured image via screen capture
