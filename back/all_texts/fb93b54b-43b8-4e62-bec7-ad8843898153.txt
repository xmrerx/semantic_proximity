A Republican member of Congress was caught scrubbing his Wikipedia page of potentially embarrassing information, including his affiliation with a cult.
Rep. David Jolly s (FL) congressional campaign was caught in the act.
Jolly is running to replace Senator Marco Rubio after his failed presidential campaign.A spokesman for Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that the campaign removed certain information, including references to the Church of Scientology, that once appeared on Jolly s Wikipedia page.Spokeswoman Sarah Bascom confirmed to BuzzFeed that the campaign took off parts of the Wikipedia entry that told of Jolly s ties to Scientology.
The campaign also removed references to Jolly s past career as a lobbyist and his past positions on gay marriage, according to the report.Jolly told a local newspaper the attempt to hide the information was a careless staff mistake, but the incident follows a pattern of politicians and their underlings attempting to remove information from the heavily trafficked encyclopedia site.
Corporations have also previously been caught attempting to remove unflattering information or add PR fluff to the site as well.The information Jolly tried to remove has been restored, with a sentence noting:Jolly s relationship with the Church of Scientology, which is based inside his congressional district in Clearwater, Florida, has been reported on in the press, including Jolly s attendance at various fundraising events hosted by the organization.Via TheLipTV, here is the invitation for the Scientology fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi involving David Jolly that his campaign tried to hide:David Jolly Scientology InvitationThe Daily Beast reported on Jolly s ties to Scientology in a story headlined Scientology Could Get Its Own Senator.
In addition to Jolly s fundraising connection to the group, his wife was slated to be a model in a charity fashion show for the group, and the treasurer for his PAC is on the board of a group founded by Scientologists.Jolly is perhaps trying to avoid connections to Scientology due to their well-documented history of harassment campaigns against defectors, practices involving disconnecting members from their families, or their belief in alien involvement in world affairs.Featured image via screencapture
