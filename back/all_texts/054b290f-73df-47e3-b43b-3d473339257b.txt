Donald Trump is once again whining about the media investigating his ties to Russia, and attacked President Obama in the process.Despite having extensive business ties in Russia and connections to Vladimir Putin, whom he admires, Trump claimed in a Tuesday morning Twitter tantrum that he doesn t know the Russian tyrant nor does he have any deals there.
And Trump appeared to try and excuse any deals he may have by attacking President Obama for making a diplomatic deal with Iran.I don t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2017First of all, Trump has plenty of business and financial ties to Russia.According to Time,[F]or all of his denials of Russian ties lately, Trump has boasted in the past of his many meetings with Russian oligarchs.
During one trip to Moscow, Trump bragged that they all showed up to meet him to discuss projects around the globe.
Almost all of the oligarchs were in the room just to meet with him, Trump said at the time.And when Trump built a tower in Panama, his clients were wealthy Russians, the Washington Post reported.
Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.
We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia, Trump s son, Donald Jr., said at a real estate conference in 2008.Trump has also borrowed a lot of money from Russian financial institutions over the years because American banks see him as too much of a risk due to his many bankruptcies.And second, President Obama s deal with Iran was not a business deal or one that President Obama personally profits from.
It s a diplomatic deal reached to reduce Iran s nuclear program.
In other words, President Obama was doing his job to keep Americans safe, unlike Trump, who has escalated tensions between the United States and Iran along with China since taking office more than two weeks ago.What s truly amazing is that Trump is still whining about being outed for his ties to Russia and Putin.
And the fact that he would use President Obama s deal with Iran to justify his personal business deals in Russia is pathetic.And Twitter wiped the floor with him.
@realDonaldTrump You mean Americans?
