Some great news on the carbon emissions rule!
The Supreme Court agreed to stop enforcement until legal challenges are resolved.
This power grab is something that s not good on any level and in spite of the statement that it would create job it s a job killer!
Just ask anyone connected to the coal industry.A divided Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to halt enforcement of President Barack Obama s sweeping plan to address climate change until after legal challenges are resolved.The surprising move is a blow to the administration and a victory for the coalition of 27 mostly Republican-led states and industry opponents that call the regulations an unprecedented power grab.
By temporarily freezing the rule the high court s order signals that opponents have made a strong argument against the plan.
A federal appeals court last month refused to put it on hold.The court s four liberal justices said they would have denied the request.The plan aims to stave off the worst predicted impacts of climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions at existing power plants by about one-third by 2030.Appellate arguments are set to begin June 2.The compliance period starts in 2022, but states must submit their plans to the Environmental Protection Administration by September or seek an extension.Many states opposing the plan depend on economic activity tied to such fossil fuels as coal, oil and gas.
They argued that power plants will have to spend billions of dollars to begin complying with a rule that may end up being overturned.Implementation of the rules is considered essential to the United States meeting emissions-reduction targets in a global climate agreement signed in Paris last month.Read more: CNBC
