Donald Trump is known for his controversial and often racist comments and he continues to be unrelenting.
During his latest feud with Fox News and specifically Megyn Kelly, Trump tweeted an image of Kelly meeting with a Saudi prince and a woman dressed in niqab.

In his latest racist tweet, Trump does what he does best which is to play on the fears of individuals.
This time, just like many times before, Islam was used as a vehicle in which to do so.
He has called for banning Muslims from entering the United States, stood by and did nothing while a Muslim woman was kicked out of one of his rallies for simply being a Muslim, and has attacked the religion and its followers to the point where there has been a surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the country because of his comments.
Thus, the fake image of Megyn Kelly is designed to associate Kelly with Islam and Muslims, which in Trump s as well as his racist associates warped minds means something terrible and something un-American.Trump is a disturbing and a disgusting individual who appeals to folks just like him.
Let s hope that when all is said and done in terms of the elections, we can all look back and reminisce at the big bad joke that was Donald Trump running to be president of the United States.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons
