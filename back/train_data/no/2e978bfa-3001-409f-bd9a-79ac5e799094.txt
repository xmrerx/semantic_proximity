seoul ( reuters ) - china has resumed its ban on group tours into south korea , south korea s inbound travel agency said on wednesday , an issue that erupted last year as part of china s retaliation over the south s deployment of a u.s. anti-missile system .
i was told from my boss this morning that our chinese partners ( based in beijing and shandong ) said they won t send group tourists to south korea as of january , the official from naeil tour agency told reuters by phone .
the move was probably due to visa refusals by chinese authorities , the official said .
the move came despite south korean president moon jae-in s recent visit to china , which showed some signs of a thaw in relations since the row over the anti-missile system broke out last year .
