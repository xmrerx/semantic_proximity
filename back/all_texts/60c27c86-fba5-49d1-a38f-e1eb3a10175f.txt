President Trump is known for not holding back and he certainly didn t on Friday during a speech in Huntsville, Alabama.
He lashed out in a BIG way at NFL players who don t stand during the national anthem.
He said team owners should remove the silent protesters from the field Trump, appearing at a campaign rally for US Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) said he wished NFL suits would take a hard-line stance against players who take a knee while The Star-Spangled Banner is played before kickoff.
We re proud of our country, we respect our flag, Trump told supporters in Huntsville.
Wouldn t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when someone disrespects our flags to say, `Get that son of a bitch off the field right now!
Out.
He s fired!
He s fired!
Trump then pranced around the stage, arms extended, to soak up wild applause from supporters chanting, USA, USA, USA!
Trump predicted that an NFL owner will take such action although the league is arguably doing that already, by keeping former San Francisco 49ers quarterback.Colin Kaepernick off the field.
You know some owner s going to do that, Trump said.
He s going to say, `That guy who disrespects our flag, he s fired!
