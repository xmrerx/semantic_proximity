BARCELONA (Reuters) - Thousands of demonstrators waving Spanish flags demonstrated in Barcelona on Saturday in favor of Spanish unity and against a referendum on independence for Catalonia planned by regional authorities for Sunday.
The chanting crowd filled a square in central Barcelona that houses the headquarters of the Catalan regional government as well as the city council.
