DUBAI (Reuters) - Seven suspected al Qaeda militants were killed by a drone strike in central Yemen on Wednesday, residents and local officials said.
The strikes hit two cars carrying armed individuals in al-Bayda province, the sources said.
U.S. forces have repeatedly launched drone and air strikes against Yemen s al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
The group has taken advantage of a more than two-year-old civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country.
AQAP operates in several provinces in southern and eastern Yemen, including in Abyan, Shabwa and al-Bayda.
