london ( reuters ) - britain s ruling conservative party must remain cool-headed , business minister greg clark said on thursday , after a speech by prime minister theresa may at their annual conference was ruined by a prankster , letters falling off a slogan and coughing fits .
the bbc reported that while ministers were rallying around the beleaguered may and praising her guts and grace in persisting with the hour-long speech despite the mishaps , some conservative members of parliament were discussing amongst themselves whether to ask her to resign .
