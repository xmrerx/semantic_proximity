washington ( reuters ) - u.s. military assistance for hurricane relief efforts has delayed the deployment of additional forces to afghanistan , the pentagon said on thursday .
forces are flowing to afghanistan , they have been slightly delayed by ongoing hurricane relief efforts , lieutenant general kenneth mckenzie , joint staff director , told reporters .
u.s. officials have told reuters that the united states will send about 3,500 additional troops to afghanistan .
puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands were battered by hurricanes irma and maria .
hurricane maria knocked out power to puerto rico s 3.4 million residents last month , devastating the island s already dilapidated electric power infrastructure .
there are about 11,000 u.s. troops assisting in relief efforts to puerto rico , along with a number of naval vessels , according to the pentagon .
mckenzie added that relief efforts would also slow the deployment of the wasp , an amphibious assault ship , to the pacific at a time of heightened tension between north korea and the united states .
defense secretary jim mattis said earlier this week that hurricane relief efforts could have an impact on troop deployments , but did not specifically mention afghanistan .
we are ready to go even to the point that it s going to impact the deployments , perhaps , of some of these troops overseas next year , because we ve interrupted their preparation , mattis told a senate armed services committee hearing .
