Frederick Douglass and Andrew Jackson will be very disappointed in Donald Trump when they learn he fibbed a teensy bit about a Civil War battle he says happened on one of his golf courses.
According to a plaque yes, a plaque Trump proudly displays at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, the length of the Potomac River that borders his course is called the River of Blood because both Union and Southern soldiers died en masse between the 14th and 15th holes.
The FAILING New York Times reported in 2015:Between the 14th hole and the 15th tee of one of the club s two courses, Mr. Trump installed a flagpole on a stone pedestal overlooking the Potomac, to which he affixed a plaque purportedly designating The River of Blood.
Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot, the inscription reads.
The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as The River of Blood.
The inscription, beneath his family crest and above Mr. Trump s full name, concludes: It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River!
The site does have historical significance alongside the Bowling Green Massacre, in that its historical significance is completely made up.
No.
Uh-uh.
No way.
Nothing like that ever happened there, said Richard Gillespie, executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, said of Trump s claim.
Gillespie added that the only thing close to that was the Battle of Ball s Bluff in 1861 in which several hundred Union solders were killed.
It happened 11 miles upriver, nowhere near the River of Blood.
Called on his lie, Trump attempted to salvage his story by explaining: That was a prime site for river crossings.
So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot a lot of them.
Historians say that literally no one has ever died in that crossing, but Trump complains that someone might have died at some point.
How would they know that?
Trump said angrily after learning that historians say his stupid plaque is FAKE NEWS.
Were they there?
Trump says numerous historians have confirmed the River of Blood.
He did not know any of their names.
Embarrassingly for Trump, even Golf Digest took the time to debunk the blood river.Sadly, this is not the first mass killing invented by the Trump Administration.
With the Bowling Green Massacre, the Atlanta massacre, and that thing that happened in Sweden and now the River of Blood, it seems that we may not be able to trust this administration, shockingly.
Naturally, the Internet finds this news hilarious:.
@GolfDigest Making up a battle named "The River of Blood" is creeeeeeeepy.

Vs. (@JFD8) May 2, 2017The "river of blood" was the result of the "bowling green massacre" where Andrew Jackson fought Frederick Douglass and won the Civil War.
https://t.co/jfT4yjaGF6 limon (@limonpoker) May 2, 2017The River of Blood was the most tragic loss of life on US soil until the Bowling Green Massacre.
https://t.co/cFv6ccKbQQ Apophatos (@Apophatos) May 2, 2017@andylassner @BevVincent @GolfDigest Trump is on the horn to the ministry of truth to write the river of blood into history books.
Dissenters are obviously socialist terrorists.
