mexico city ( reuters ) - mexican authorities said on tuesday they will aim to identify some 3,000 bone fragments , apparently human , found at the weekend in the northern state of coahuila , where organized crime has been blamed for the loss of thousands of lives .
state prosecutors said they were sending the remains to a genetic laboratory to assess whether they could be linked to people who have disappeared .
according to government data , nearly 18,600 people have disappeared since president enrique pena nieto took office in december 2012 .
in november , he signed into law a national commission dedicated to finding people who have disappeared .
it will add some 469 million pesos ( $ 25 million ) to fund search efforts in its first stage .
gang violence has claimed more than 100,000 lives over the past decade and authorities are often unable to identify bodies found in mass graves .
vida , a coahuila-based group representing 77 people whose relatives have gone missing , found the fragments in a field on saturday after a tip-off about the location .
the group , accompanied by prosecutors , experts and members of the military , also found a metal barrel , gun casings , two buttons and a buckle .
vida spokeswoman silvia ortiz said similar previous discoveries indicated that victims bodies had been dismembered and burned for hours before the bones were broken apart with shovels .
state prosecutors said they could not yet determine how many people the bones belonged to , according to a spokesman .
