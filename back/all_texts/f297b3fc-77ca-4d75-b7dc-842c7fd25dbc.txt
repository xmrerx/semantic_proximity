Donald Trump has helped America s racists feel good about showing their true colors in all their bigoted glory.
Furthermore, amazingly, the more racist Trump s remarks get, the higher he goes in the polls.
Things that would be political suicide for almost anyone else seem to work wonders for Trump s numbers.
Well, there is yet another person who is calling Trump out: Former adviser to President Obama, Van Jones.What has Jones so upset is most ominous indeed.
It seems that a think tank of white power types that go by the name American Renaissance is so impressed with Trump s racism that they are now making robocalls on behalf of his bid for the presidency.
The calls focus specifically on Trump s ban all Muslims plan.
The horrible message says: We don t need Muslims.
We need smart well-educated white people who can assimilate to our culture.
Van Jones appeared on Face the Nation on Sunday, and he blasted the dangerous, bigoted rhetoric that has made Trump so popular with racists: This is troubling.
If I were [Donald] Trump, this is a time to look in the mirror.
Who am I inspiring?
Who am I attracting?
Why will horrible racist groups say I m the only candidate that speaks for them?
This is what is my deep concern is that Donald Trump is beginning to legitimate some of the dark things that have been in our country for a long time, and now starting to let them elevate, let them rise.
Jones is right, of course, but, unfortunately, Trump doesn t care.
All he cares about is numbers, and if it takes being bald-faced racist to get them, then, by God, that s what he ll do.
The GOP s base is full of ignorant bigots, and Donald Trump has done a perfect job of courting them.
Help us all if he actually gets anywhere near the Oval Office.Watch the interview with Van Jones below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story
