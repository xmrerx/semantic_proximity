Donald Trump has been coming apart at the seams before our very eyes.
The public has noticed, certainly, but so has someone else: Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine.
Hillary Clinton s veep said the following of Trump s attempts to blame the rest of the world for the accusations of groping that keep coming out against him: He is swinging at every phantom of his own imagination because he knows he s losing.
These remarks were made on ABC s This Week, and Kaine also made it crystal clear that Trump s allegations that Hillary s campaign had anything to do with the avalanche of unflattering stories that have come out ever since Trump was caught on a hot mic with then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, insisting that he could do anything he wanted to women because he is a star.While discussing Trump, Kaine also reminded America of the orange buffoon s bullying behavior, and said that the hot mic tape is what gave these women the courage to tell the stories of their experience with Trump: That s what s going on.
It s not because of our campaign, but it s very characteristic of Donald Trump that now he s blaming these women.He s making weird claims that, no, I couldn t have assaulted this person, she s not attractive enough to assault.
How bizarre is that?
He s blaming the media; he s blaming the GOP; he s saying that America can t run a fair election.
And this is what bullies do.
Tim Kaine is right.
Trump bullies and threatens anyone who he can t get his way with.
He makes sure that people understand that he ll make their lives a living hell if they dare to go against him, no matter how horrible his behavior has been.Well, it looks like Trump has finally met his match, and the tantrum he throws when he loses on election night is sure to be one for the ages.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
