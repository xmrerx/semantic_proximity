A National Rifle Association television host went full racist on Sunday to celebrate Donald trump taking over the White House.In an offensive post on Twitter, right-wing gun nut Chuck Holton wrote that President Obama, the first black president, left a brown stain across America.
And he couldn t even spell his racial slur correctly.
Okay!
he wrote.
Party s over.
Let s get busy scrubbing Obama s mocacchino stain off of America!

Chuck Holton (@rangerholton) January 22, 2017You know, because a mochaccino is a brown chocolate color and President Obama s skin color is brown.Seriously, President Obama left the White House two days ago but conservatives are STILL making racist remarks about him.Holton, who pathetically only has 413 followers on Twitter, got torched by a couple Twitter users.
@rangerholton At least spell your hateful insult correctly: mochaccino Cassy Blue (@CassyBlue3) January 23, 2017Was it the reversed recession?
The 16 million jobs?
Or having OBL shot in the face?
@rangerholton Me!
(@Nativemanley) January 23, 2017But Holton just doesn t post his racism on Twitter.
He posts his sexism there as well.For example, here are some of his attacks on the Women s March.Women spent more than $150 million attending a march and accomplished nothing.
Liberalism in a nutshell.
