Voodoo Doughnut is a very unique dessert shop in Portland, Oregon.
They have many one-of-a-kind desserts, in very creative designs.
However, according to the one of shop s proprietors, Kenneth Cat Daddy Pogson, they usually stop short of engaging in political discourse via their dessert creations.
But Pogson said they just couldn t resist when it came to the ridiculousness that was the Oregon militants engaged in a standoff with the authorities at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon.To that end, once the standoff was over and the group s leader, Ammon Bundy, was in custody, Pogson made his thoughts known in the way he usually does: with a unique doughnut depicting Ammon Bundy in a jail cell.via The Oregonian TwitterPogson revealed to The Oregonian his reasons for breaking his own rules regarding politics, saying: but this whole thing seemed like such a big deal with them taking public property, armed to the teeth, making a stand that they thought everyone would join.
It was a debacle that was on everyone s mind, left or right.
Once he heard Bundy had been arrested, he told his donut artist: I want a face behind bars and the words Welcome to Portland.'
Welcome to Portland indeed.
We re sure Ammon Bundy won t be getting any of Pogson s delicious doughnuts where he s going.Pogson also said that he wanted to make it clear that he was not mocking LaVoy Finicum, the vocal occupier at the refuge who perished in a shootout with police.
Pogson said of Finicum: The death was senseless.
I didn t want it to come off like I was ridiculing [Finicum].
He died for what he believed in.
I don t believe in it.
But I wanted to send this message.
[Bundy] is no longer among his people.
Now he s on the left coast.
Likely, that s where Bundy will stay, as he should.
Enjoy your time in prison, Mr. Bundy.
The rest of Oregon will go on with their lives, and thanks to you, have a new doughnut to enjoy.Featured image via voodoodoughnut.
