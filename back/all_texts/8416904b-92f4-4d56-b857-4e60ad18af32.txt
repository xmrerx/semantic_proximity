Kanye West announced on Twitter this week that he s $53 million in debt.
He immediately began begging for help from white billionaires.
The very next day, West took to Twitter to announce he doesn t want White publications covering black musicians anymore.
HOW and WHY does this racist black rapper get a pass from the media after making such clearly racist and ignorant comments?
Watch the video below to see West s interview with SaturdayNightOnline.com host Garrett, as he compares his dangerous career as a rapper to that of a cop on patrol or soldier at war.
I m putting my life at risk, literally!
When I think about when I m on the Can t Tell Me Nothing, and Coldest Winter moment, like that mountain goes really, really high.
And if I slipped you never know.
And I think about it.
I think about my family and I m like, wow, this is like being a police officer or something, in war or something.
It s pretty sad that a guy with no talent has been given so much opportunity in America, and has literally blown it because he can t keep his big fat, hateful racist mouth shut.
