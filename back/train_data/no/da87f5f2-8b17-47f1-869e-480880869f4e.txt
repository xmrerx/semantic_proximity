washington ( reuters ) - expanding the u.s. navy to 355 ships as recommended by military leaders and backed by president donald trump would cost some $ 400 billion more over the next 30 years than the currently planned 308-ship fleet , according to a study released on monday .
the annual cost to build , crew and operate a 355-ship fleet would be about $ 102 billion , or 13 percent more than the $ 90 billion needed for the currently planned navy , according to the study by the nonpartisan congressional budget office .
the $ 102 billion cost of the 355-ship fleet is 33 percent more than congress appropriated in 2016 for the current 275-ship navy , the cbo said .
to achieve the larger force , the navy would need $ 26.6 billion annually for ship construction , which is 60 percent more than the average amount that congress has appropriated for shipbuilding in the past 30 years , the cbo study said .
the navy â€™ s 2017 shipbuilding plan called for boosting the size of the fleet to 308 ships , which was expected to cost $ 21.2 billion per year to implement over 30 years .
with trump pressing for an expansion of the fleet to 350 ships during the presidential campaign last year , the navy released a new force structure assessment in december seeking a 355-ship navy .
taking into consideration older ships being retired , creating a 355-ship fleet would require the navy to buy about 329 new ships over 30 years , compared with 254 under its previous plan for a 308-ship fleet , the cbo study found .
the navy would have to buy about 12 ships per year under the larger fleet plan , versus about eight per year under the earlier plan .
the larger fleet would require more civilian and uniformed personnel and more aircraft , pushing up overall operating costs , the cbo said .
the increase in shipbuilding would force all seven u.s. shipyards to expand their work forces and improve their infrastructure in order to meet the demand for vessels , the cbo said .
the greatest challenge would be building submarines to meet the force structure requirements , the report said .
the study said the earliest the navy could achieve a 355-ship fleet would be the year 2035 , or 18 years from now .
