CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will meet Saad al-Hariri, who announced his resignation as Lebanese prime minister on Nov. 4, on Tuesday evening, the presidency said on Monday.
Sisi and Hariri s meeting will address the latest developments in the region and developments of the Lebanon situation, a statement from Egypt s presidency said.
Hariri has since Saturday been in Paris, where he met French President Emmanuel Macron.
He has said he will return to Lebanon by Wednesday for the country s Independence Day celebrations.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has said he will not accept Hariri s resignation until it is delivered in person and all sides in Beirut have called for his speedy return.
The resignation sparked a political crisis in Lebanon and put it on the front line of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Hariri criticised Iran and its ally Hezbollah, which is in Lebanon s coalition government, in his resignation.
