bogor , indonesia ( reuters ) - qatar is open to dialogue in resolving a dispute that has seen the gulf state isolated from its arab neighbors , its emir said during a visit to indonesia on wednesday .
saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade ties with qatar on june 5 , accusing it of financing terrorism and maintaining too close of ties to their arch-rival iran .
doha denies the charges .
qatari emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani said he discussed the issue with president joko widodo of indonesia , which has the world s largest population of muslims and has close ties to the arab world .
we conveyed ... that qatar is ready to conduct a dialogue to solve the problem as we already know that no one will win , thani told reporters after meeting with widodo at the state palace in bogor , outside the capital of jakarta .
we are all brothers and suffering because of this crisis , he added .
president widodo did not publicly address the dispute .
the leader of the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas also visited malaysia - another muslim-majority nation - and singapore this week .
saudi and other arab nations have made a list of 13 wide-ranging demands of qatar , including closing down the al jazeera television network and curbing ties with iran .
kuwait and top united states officials have attempted to mediate between the parties , but there is little sign that the crisis will be resolved soon .
