DUBLIN (Reuters) - An Irish general election appeared likely after opposition party Fianna Fail submitted a motion of no confidence on Friday in the deputy prime minister, which the ruling party considers a breach of a three-year agreement to support prime minister Leo Varadkar s government.
Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin told state broadcaster RTE that his party had submitted the motion.
A senior member of Varadkar s Fine Gael party earlier said that the submission of a no confidence motion by Fianna Fail would kill the deal to support the government.
