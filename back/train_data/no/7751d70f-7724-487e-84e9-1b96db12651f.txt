washington ( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump said he does not have to win the new hampshire primary vote on tuesday to secure the nomination , apparently tamping down expectations despite holding a double-digit lead in that state ’ s polls .
the billionaire businessman came in second to texas senator ted cruz in the iowa caucuses last week , although polls put him ahead .
his candidacy has alarmed the republican establishment and has been marked by rows , including over his calls for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states .
no republican has won the presidential nomination without winning either the iowa caucuses or the new hampshire primary since the 1970s , but it would not technically be impossible .
asked whether a loss in new hampshire would derail his campaign , trump told the nbc news show “ meet the press ” : “ i don ’ t think i need it .
i hope that i get it. ” “ i would like to win but i don ’ t know that it is necessary. ” recent opinion polls give him a lead of between 10 and 22 percentage points over the next closest contender .
trump has built his campaign in part around his self-declared reputation as a “ winner , ” and a loss in new hampshire would intensify doubts that he can translate opinion poll support into votes .
he also told “ meet the press ” that he has spent as much as $ 50 million less than expected on the campaign so far , in part because the media provides him so much free publicity .
“ people like you put me on .
what do i take a commercial for ? ” trump told the show ’ s moderator , chuck todd .
