kirkuk , iraq ( reuters ) - kurdish forces have moved back their defensive line around the oil region of kirkuk in northern iraq by 2 km ( 1.2 miles ) to reduce the possibility of friction with nearby iraqi forces , security sources in the region said on friday .
the peshmerga , as the kurdish force is known , withdrew from positions in the areas of taza and bashir , about 10 km south of kirkuk , overnight , they said .
iraqi security forces moved into some of the positions evacuated in an orderly manner , without any clashes , they said .
the areas of taza and bashir are mainly populated by shi ite turkmen , many of whom are loyal to the shi ite led-government in baghdad and affiliated to iranian-backed political parties and paramilitary groups .
