Ever since the leaked tape of Donald Trump s hot mic before appearing on Access Hollywood revealing he has sexually assaulted women, many have been weighing in on what the candidate is calling locker room talk.
Trump apparently thinks that it is perfectly fine to talk about being sexually aggressive towards women without their consent, and also apparently thinks that this is what men talk about in locker rooms.Well, one man who spends a lot of time in locker rooms is speaking up and calling out Trump, and that person is none other than the legendary NBA champ LeBron James.James told reporters what actually goes on in locker rooms, which usually has a lot to do with what happened during the game.
He also said: That s not locker room talk.
That s trash talk.
Emphasizing the fact that he has many women in his life, as well as children, and wouldn t want that sort of talk around them, nor does he think it is okay.Good on James for speaking out against Trump and his crude and horrific talk.
Hopefully, this becomes a trend, and more and more athletes take a stand against the reality television host.Trump shouldn t be allowed near women, let alone the Oval Office.
Remember to vote BLUE this November 8th.Watch the video here:LeBron weighs in on Donald Trump: That s not locker room talk.
That s trash talk.
