beirut ( reuters ) - syrian government and allied forces have taken the eastern town of al-mayadeen from islamic state , a syrian military source said on saturday , further weakening the militants diminishing presence in syria .
al-mayadeen , near the iraqi border in deir al zor province , had become a major base for islamic state militants as they were being driven out of their de facto syrian capital in raqqa city by a u.s.-backed offensive .
over the past few months many of the individuals which the u.s.-led coalition against islamic state has targeted have come from al-mayadeen , coalition spokesman ryan dillon told reuters .
the syrian government campaign to take al-mayadeen has been supported by heavy russian air strikes .
the u.s.-led coalition has also previously struck in the vicinity of the town .
al-mayadeen lies south of the provincial capital deir al-zor city , where syrian and allied forces are also trying to oust the militants from a small pocket they still control .
the syrian military source said the jihadists in al-mayadeen had suffered a collapse in their ranks .
