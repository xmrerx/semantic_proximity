In the course of hosting Thursday s Breitbart News Daily, Breitbart London Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam stood up for departed Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, who has been under sustained attack from the Left since becoming first Donald Trump s campaign chairman and now chief White House strategist.Kassam recalled how he was a 27-year-old with his own website when he met Bannon in late 2013.
He came to me and he said, You know, I hear great things about you.
Can you do what you do from inside Breitbart?
At the time Breitbart was not a very well known name in the U.K.
I admit to being skeptical what was the commitment going to be?
Would I be taken care of?
Would I have editorial freedom?
Why do they want me, or trust me?
he said.
But I knew of Breitbart from my trips to CPAC there s only ever been about 12 Brits at CPAC, in any one year, but I was always one of them, he continued.
In 2013 I took Bannon at his word, and my life has just become a remarkable journey since.
And that s why they re calling him one.
They re projecting.
The liberal media, who has decided amongst themselves what the world should look like through their ideology sees people who stand athwart history yelling stop as the biggest threat to their androgynous, zombie civilization.
Stephen K. Bannon is the man who flew to London to hire me, this brown guy called Raheem Kassam from a Muslim family to run his London operation, and he s now put him in the seat on his radio show.
Swallow that, liberals.
Swallow that, CNN.
Swallow that, New York Times.
