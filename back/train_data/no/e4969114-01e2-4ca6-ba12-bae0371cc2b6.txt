nancy pelosi attempted to offer her ( incoherent ) thoughts on the democrat inspired shooting of us rep. steve scalise ( r-la ) that took place yesterday at the hands of 66 yr. old bernie sanders supporter and trump hater in alexandria , va .
in case anyone hasn t noticed , nancy seems to be living in an alternate world lately .
she s frequently confused and regularly makes nonsensical remarks , but referring to a fellow congressional member who s in critical condition in the hospital as deceased ?
really nancy ? watch : https : //twitter.com/joshdcaplan/status/875413158600613889when will nancy s voters begin to demand she take a competency test or step aside for the good of the nation ? here are just a few of nancy s latest and best missteps .
they would almost be humorous if she wasn t working as a public servant with a great deal of responsibility.on april 26 , 2017 , house minority leader nancy pelosi appeared on meet the press and gave a completely incoherent response to a question about the border wall .
for the second time in a matter of weeks , progressive leftist democrat minority leader nancy pelosi displayed what many believe can only be accredited to having a severe case of trump derangement syndrome .
while speaking to abc s jonathan karl , nancy confused the presidency of donald trump with george w. bush for the second time since president trump s inauguration.during two public appearances in march 2017 , nancy confused iran with iraq , pronounced words strangely , and claimed republicans are offering a mini me or mickey mouse budget .
ends her very strange press conference by saying , i don t know .
but there s no there there .
we re beginning to wonder if nancy is still there ? is nancy so flustered and panicked by trump s presidency and her diminished role in congress that she is no longer able to speak in public ?
or , is it possible ( all kidding aside ) that she needs to be examined by a medical professional ? you be the judge
