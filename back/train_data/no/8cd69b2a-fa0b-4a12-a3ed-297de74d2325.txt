kigali ( reuters ) - a rwandan opposition official and eight others were charged on wednesday with forming an armed group and seeking to overthrow the government - indictments that could see them jailed for life .
boniface twagirimana , the vice president of the fdu inkingi movement , denied the charges in the kigali court .
the party s leader , victoire ingabire , is already in jail , convicted of conspiring to form an armed group and other charges in 2013 .
the prosecutor said the defendants had joined p5 , describing it as an umbrella group of five organizations , including fdu inkingi , operating outside the country .
the central african nation has been widely praised for the speed of its economic growth , and for its overall recovery from the genocide that killed more than 800,000 people in 1994 .
but rights groups have accused it of fueling conflict and backing armed groups in neighboring democratic republic of congo .
president paul kagame has also faced mounting criticism for what activists say are widespread abuses , a muzzling of independent media , and suppression of political opposition - accusations he dismisses .
only one defendant pleaded guilty to a charge - papias ndayishimiye , who said he had planned to join the group to offer some help .
he joined the others in denying plotting against the government .
they could be jailed for 10-15 years if convicted of forming an armed group , and for life if found guilty of planning to overthrow the government .
early this month , police arrested diane shima rwigara , a leading critic of kagame , and charged her with forgery and tax evasion .
