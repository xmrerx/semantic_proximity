beirut ( reuters ) - the deir al-zor military airport in eastern syria , which the syrian army recaptured this month from islamic state , began functioning again on monday for the first time in nearly a year , syrian state media and a monitoring group said .
the military base is seen as a valuable asset for the syrian army as it presses its campaign against islamic state in deir al-zor province .
two planes landed and took off from the base on monday , state tv reported - the first such activity there since september 2016 , the syrian observatory for human rights monitoring group said .
monday s flights carried aid to deir al-zor , syrian state media and the british-based observatory said .
on sunday , the united nations said it had halted costly airdrops to the city as a land corridor opened .
the u.n. has estimated that some 93,000 people were living in extremely difficult conditions in government-held parts of deir al-zor during the islamic state siege and were supplied by air drops to the base .
syrian government forces and their allies broke islamic state s three year siege of deir al-zor earlier this month , reaching the government-held enclave in the city and the adjacent air base .
the syrian army and u.s.-backed militias are fighting separate offensives against islamic state in the province , the jihadist group s last major stronghold in syria .
