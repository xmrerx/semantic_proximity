Wilbur Ross spoke with WaPo about true tax reform He did a great job explaining his position on simplifying and cutting taxes.
He said the W2 should be a one pager .
He believes it takes entirely too long for the average employee to do taxes We say Amen to that!If Congress doesn t get in the way, tax cuts and simplification are a possibility.
Ross is such a great pick for President Trump.
he s another one who doesn t need this job at all but is doing it for America.
Pretty awesome!MORE ON WILBUR ROSS:WILBUR ROSS ON NEIL CAVUTO: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is one smart man when it comes to making an economic argument against the Paris Accord.
He appeared on Neil Cavuto right before President Trump spoke and brilliantly discussed why we need to get out of this boondoggle that will drain America of trillions of dollars.
We re so lucky he s our Commerce Secretary!
He s apolitical and strictly looking at what s best for America financially.WILBUR ROSS TAKES ON MATT LAUER: Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce, tells that President Trump s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord does not mean that the U.S. will do nothing to combat climate change.
He says that President Trump is an environmentalist and that the decision will do nothing to damage America s national security.
Yes, you can be an environmentalist and care about the planet BUT not be for this boondoggle!
