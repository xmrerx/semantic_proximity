21st Century Wire says This has been an ongoing project of the search giant, long in the making, and already underway.
In fact, this website, 21stCenturyWire.com, has felt the impact of its content being disappeared in Google s search results resulting in a drop of over 50% in our organic search query traffic since April.It s those kinds of sites like RT, Sputnik, 21WIRE and many others that are targets in the grand plan, as outlined here by Robert Parry of Consortium News: YOU DON T NEED A HUGE AMOUNT OF IMAGINATION TO SEE HOW THIS COMBINATION OF MAINSTREAM GROUPTHINK AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD CREATE AN ORWELLIAN FUTURE IN WHICH ONLY ONE SIDE OF A STORY GETS TOLD AND THE OTHER SIDE SIMPLY DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW.
RTGoogle will de-rank RT articles to make them harder to find Eric SchmidtEric Schmidt, the Executive Chairman of Google s parent company Alphabet, says the company will engineer specific algorithms for RT and Sputnik to make their articles less prominent on the search engine s news delivery services.
We are working on detecting and de-ranking those kinds of sites it s basically RT and Sputnik, Schmidt said during a Q & A session at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada on Saturday, when asked about whether Google facilitates Russian propaganda.
We are well of aware of it, and we are trying to engineer the systems to prevent that [the content being delivered to wide audiences].
But we don t want to ban the sites that s not how we operate.
The discussion focused on the company s popular Google News service, which clusters the news by stories, then ranks the various media outlets depending on their reach, article length and veracity, and Google Alerts, which proactively informs subscribers of new publications.RT has criticized the proposed move whose timescale has not been publicized as arbitrary and a form of censorship.Good to have Google on record as defying all logic and reason: facts aren t allowed if they come from RT, because Russia even if we have Google on Congressional record saying they ve found no manipulation of their platform or policy violations by RT, Sputnik and RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan said in a statement.During the discussion, Schmidt claimed that he was very strongly not in favor of censorship, but said that he has faith in ranking without acknowledging if the system might serve the same function.
Schmidt, who joined Google in 2001, said that the company s algorithm was capable of detecting repetitive, exploitative, false, and weaponized info, but did not elaborate on how these qualities were determined.The Alphabet chief, who has been referred to by Hillary Clinton as a longtime friend, added that the experience of the last year showed that audiences could not be trusted to distinguish fake and real news for themselves.Continue this story at RT READ MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV
