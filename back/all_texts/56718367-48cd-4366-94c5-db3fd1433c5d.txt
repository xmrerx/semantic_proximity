Donald Trump isn t the guy you would think would be the Republican frontrunner for the presidential nomination, because Republicans are typically more slick about wanting to implement backwards and draconian policies.
Trump, however, has taken GOP voters by storm with his calls for violence, his chauvinistic stances on women, and his blunt racist rhetoric against Muslims and Mexicans.Yet, somehow, Trump always finds a way of justifying his policies to the satisfaction of his vast support among a segment of America that has found its hero.
That was all on display as cartoon Trump made on appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to justify his latest shenanigans.
Colbert began the segment with Speaking of stupid and Mad Men, Donald Trump, and then the funny man unleashed his humorous fury on the Republican golden boy.Among Trump s wacky moments of the week was his exchange with Anderson Cooper when Cooper said Trump was acting like a five-year-old child in response to Trump saying that Ted Cruz started the wife bashing contest.
Every parent has heard a kid say that about another kid, Cooper said, as Trump clearly looked embarrassed.
Yet cartoon Trump found a way yo defend himself.Then there was his defense of Corey Lewandowski s alleged assault on a female reporter.
She had a pen, Donald said.
It could have been a bomb.
The segment is brilliant because it highlights the absurdity of Trump, perhaps with the hope that voters can see the insanity and danger of voting for this person.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Ivji-ph4A] Featured image via video screenshot.
