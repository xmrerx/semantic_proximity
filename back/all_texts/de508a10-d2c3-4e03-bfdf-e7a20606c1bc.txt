People have long speculated about Donald Trump s mental state.
While it was once seen as unseemly to suggest that a public figure may be crazy, Trump s alarming behavior warrants an exception especially since he has the nuclear codes.
Well, it s not our imagination and that s not just because we can see with every wild statement and unhinged Twitter rant that something is wrong with Trump.
It s because, according to former Republican Congressman and current host of MSNBC s Morning Joe reported on Thursday that several of Trump s allies confided to him that Trump has dementia.Then, Scarborough went all in, and called for the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, and in doing so, decided to list many of Trump s infamous incidences of con artistry in the process: If this is not what the 25th Amendment was drafted for, I would like the Cabinet members serving America not the president you serve America, and you know it.
You know you don t serve Donald J. Trump.
Scam developer, scam Trump University proprietor, reality TV show host.
You don t represent him.
You represent 320 million people whose lives are literally in your hands, and we are facing a showdown with a nuclear power.
You have somebody inside the White House that the New York Daily News says is mentally unfit.
That people close to him say is mentally unfit, that people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia.
This is astounding.
Joe Scarborough is no liberal.
I disagree with a lot of what he says, but he s definitely putting his country before his party, and doing the right thing.
It s time for Republicans to stop being cowards and remove Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
