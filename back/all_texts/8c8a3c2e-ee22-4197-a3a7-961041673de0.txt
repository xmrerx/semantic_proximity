There are seldom those moments in life that seem so poetic, but the people sharing the space where the Republican congressional retreat is being held is pretty much the perfect metaphor for the embodiment of the GOP party platform.It s all happening at the Marriott Hotel at the Baltimore Harbor, and right down the hall from where Republicans are trying to put together strategies for the coming year that is where the Mid-Atlantic Monument Builders Association is holding their annual summit.
And within the room where the Monument Builders are meeting, there is a huge sampling of headstones.How is this the perfect metaphor for the Republican party?
So glad you asked.The GOP has spent nearly the past thirty years trying to make sure people have a rougher go at life than they could if they had a government that actually worked in their best interest.
Instead of fighting for people to have greater access to health care, they ve been mercilessly fighting against broadened access and affordable coverage.
They ve also been trying for decades to privatize social security instead of strengthen our existing government pension program that guarantees income for senior citizens who worked hard all their lives.
They d prefer a system that relied on an unsteady market where people could, quite literally, lose everything.
The GOP has also consistently tried to make it harder for low-income citizens to have access to Medicaid and food assistance programs.
Not to mention the GOP s love for war and lust for sending American lives to die for causes still unknown.So, to see gravestones just steps away from where congressional Republicans are talking about ideas is absolutely perfect.
Their ideas and plans for the people of this nation would lead to the early demise of several citizens.
Kudos to whoever chose that space to hold the event, it s very telling of GOP policy.
