Large crowds, fights and a woman arrested for pulling a knife none are normally synonymous with a toy giveaway.
But Saturday on Detroit s west side, hundreds, if not thousands, gathered for free Christmas toys.Police had to be called in because, at times, the crowds were unruly.
People were fighting over toys, so they shut the door, one person said.It was likely a first for any kind of toy giveaway, crowds so large Detroit police had to step in, and those trying to get toys, at times, getting out of control.Saturday night s toy giveaway is part of a program called Toys Making I.M.P.A.C.T.S.
For months, those in need could register for free toys for their children, and when the doors opened at Tower Center Mall on Grand River Avenue at 4 p.m., close to 6,000 children were signed up.And more families who didn t sign up showed up.The organizers admit that organization and crowd control is on them.
They just weren t expecting so many people.A 39-year-old woman was arrested after pulling a knife on someone during a fight.
No one was hurt, but this happened in front of her children, so Detroit police had to take them back to the precinct and try to find other family members.
