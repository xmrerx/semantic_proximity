guatemala city ( reuters ) - guatemala s congress on wednesday approved a national emergency decree to curb penalties for illegal election financing after the country s president was linked to suspected irregularities during his 2015 election campaign .
the change eliminates criminal responsibility for authorizing electoral funds that prove to be illegal and makes party accountants responsible for irregularities rather than party leaders .
the reform , approved by a vote of 105-19 , also reduces the penalty for illegal election financing from a maximum of 12 years to 10 and allows for paying a fine in order to avoid jail time .
the decree was the latest blow to the prosecutor s office and the international commission against impunity in guatemala ( cicig ) after congress this week voted to preserve president jimmy morales immunity from prosecution .
prosecutors had sought to remove morales immunity to investigate him over some $ 800,000 in allegedly unexplained campaign funds when he was the head of his party .
prosecutors are also investigating guatemala s other major parties .
under the leadership of ivan velasquez , a veteran colombian prosecutor , the cicig has caused problems for morales , first investigating his son and brother , and then seeking to prosecute him over the allegedly unexplained campaign funds .
the u.s. ambassador to guatemala , todd robinson , expressed his disappointment in a message on twitter .
years of malnutrition , insecurity , crime , corruption .
congress ?
no action .
amazing how fast they act to protect selves from prosecution , he said in a post .
really ?
national emergency ?
what a shame !
