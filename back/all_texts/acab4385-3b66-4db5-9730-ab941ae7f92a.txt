By now, pretty much everyone has seen pictures or video footage of Bill Clinton snoozing while Hillary gave her powerful speech filled with lies and empty promises.At times, Bill just couldn t contain himself over the excitement of his beloved wife being coronated by a hostile crowd in Philly We watched him walk around the stage after Hillary s coronation looking like he was in some type of stupor, but the footage of him with the little girl at the bottom really takes the cake.Hillary s loser brother was about to hit the balloon when he realized he was standing next to the queen and quickly retreated He was so excited to hit the balloon, then he realized who he was standing next to #DemsInPhilly pic.twitter.com/kZjzwZ6A4y Brandon Wall (@Walldo) July 29, 2016After watching Hillary s regular coughing fits, and knowing that she has to travel with a full-time physician, shouldn t American voters be asking themselves if either one of these aging grifters are well enough to occupy our White House?Here s Bill looking a little confused about why there are suddenly so many balloons around him:Bill Clinton just hanging out with the balloons, having a blast pic.twitter.com/JKCW1zqay7 Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) July 29, 2016Here s Bill wishing Hillary would pay attention to him.
