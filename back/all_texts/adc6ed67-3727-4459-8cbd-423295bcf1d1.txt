WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday attacked the decision by FBI Director James Comey to not recommend charges against Democrat Hillary Clinton for use of a private email server, saying it “defies explanation.” “Declining to prosecute Secretary Clinton for recklessly mishandling and transmitting national security information will set a terrible precedent,” Ryan, a Republican, said in a statement.
“The findings of this investigation also make clear that Secretary Clinton misled the American people when she was confronted with her criminal actions.”
