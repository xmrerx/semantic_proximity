beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon s energy minister on friday called on companies bidding in its first round of licensing to explore for oil and gas in its mediterranean waters to begin technical discussions , suggesting the process would continue despite the political crisis .
prime minister saad al-hariri resigned in a speech from saudi arabia last saturday and has yet to return to the country , sparking a political crisis .
president aoun has said he will not accept hariri s resignation until he returns to the country , while the lebanese authorities have said they consider the government to still be legitimate .
and energy and water minister cesar abi khalil said on twitter that he signed a document on friday calling on companies who submitted bids for the offshore license blocks to negotiate the technical proposals .
lebanon sits on the levant basin in the eastern mediterranean where a number of big subsea gas fields have been discovered since 2009 , including the leviathan and tamar fields situated in israeli waters near to the disputed marine border with lebanon .
lebanon re-launched the tendering competition for the exploration and production rights in january after a three-year delay due to political paralysis .
however , a consortium made up of france s total , italy s eni and russia s novatek , made the only offer in the tendering process which closed on october 12 , with bids for two of the blocks .
the lebanese petroleum administration has said it will evaluate bids for the offshore blocks and present them to the energy minister by nov. 13 .
final approval will then be sought from lebanon s council of ministers .
