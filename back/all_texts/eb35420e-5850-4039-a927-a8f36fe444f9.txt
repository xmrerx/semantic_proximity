BEIRUT (Reuters) - Two rockets struck near Damascus airport at dawn on Friday, Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen reported, an attack it said had probably been carried out by Israeli warplanes from outside Syria s borders.
Al-Mayadeen gave no further details in the report carried in a news flash on screen.
An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports of the air strike, saying: We do not respond to such reports.
Earlier this month, the Syrian army reported an Israeli air strike on a military site in Syria s Hama province.
Israel says it has hit arms convoys of the Syrian military and its Iranian-backed ally Hezbollah nearly 100 times in the past five years.
Israel, which fought a 2006 war with Hezbollah, sees red lines in the shipment to the powerful Shi ite group of anti-aircraft missiles, precision ground-to-ground missiles and chemical weapons.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors Syria s civil war, said the attack earlier this month was on a facility of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, an agency which the United States describes as Syria s chemical weapons manufacturer.
Syria s government denies using chemical arms.
In 2013 it promised to surrender its chemical weapons, which it says it has done.
