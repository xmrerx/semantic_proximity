WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Pyongyang is a problem that “will be taken care of,” as speculation rose that North Korea might be on the verge of a sixth nuclear test.
Trump, responding to a question about what his message is for North Korea, said, “North Korea is a problem.
The problem will be taken care of.” He said he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping would “work very hard” to help resolve the challenge.
The president said he had spent a lot of time with Xi last week in Florida.
“I have really gotten to like and respect President Xi.
... He’s a very special man.
I think he’s going to try very hard.”
