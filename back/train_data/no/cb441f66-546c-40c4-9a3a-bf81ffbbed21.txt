james o keefe has been at the forefront of new media since he outed acorn posing as a pimp who can forget that !
he s exposed the left time and time again his latest video exposed liberal organizers suggesting violent ways to disrupt the inauguration of president trump.it seems o keefe recognizes that we are at war with the press more than anyone on the left .
the blatant lies and complete distortions of just about anything president trump says are happening 24/7 on cnn , msnbc , abc , nbc and cbs .
it s time to expose the real fake news thank you james o keefe ! here s o keefe s first release where joe sterling , cnn s news desk editor for the wire telling one of o keefe s undercover reporters that climate change is settled science and , there is no debate .
i mean , i m a little biased joe sterling , once news desk editor @ cnn admits he has a clear bias in favor of @ potus44 .
does n't # cnn claim to be `` most trusted ? ''
# cnnleaks pic.twitter.com/vhxejck1ll james o'keefe ( @ jamesokeefeiii ) february 23 , 2017the second release in a long list of undercover cnn tapes , proves trump was correct when he talked about the polls being rigged .
we all knew that president trump was correct when he told americans , don t believe the polls that were incorrectly pointing to a huge hillary win .
we all know how that story ends .
trump beat hillary in a landslide , and beat her in states that polls like cnn s , told us he had no chance of winning .
listen to cnn try to reason with o keefe s undercover reporter about why they refuse to update their polls after new information emerges that could be a game changer in how the public perceives it : when questioned about their tactics and why they choose not to use new data to update one of their polls , cnn s executive editor arthur brice responded , i agree .
i think its dishonest to use outdated information if new information shows something that is in variance with something you re reporting .
it s just dishonest .
in this bit we found @ cnn 's executive editor @ arthurbrice talks about using `` dishonest and outdated information '' in cnn 's polls .
