As the GOP paves the way for Hillary The campaigns of Ohio Gov.
John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have announced they are clearing paths for each other in certain states in an effort to deny Donald Trump the necessary delegates to win the Republican nomination.
Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans, Cruz s campaign manager Jeff Roe wrote in a statement Sunday.
To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov.
Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.
The Kasich campaign followed their lead and released a similar statement.
We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign resource s West and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana, Katich for America chief strategist John Weaver wrote.
