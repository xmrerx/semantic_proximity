chicago ( reuters ) - the chicago city council ’ s finance committee on monday approved payments totaling $ 6.45 million to settle cases involving two black men who died while in police custody .
the settlements come as the third-biggest u.s. city ’ s police department faces a federal investigation and racism accusations over the death of black teenager laquan mcdonald .
chicago mayor rahm emanuel fired his police commissioner in 2015 after protests following the release of a video showing a chicago police officer shooting 17-year-old mcdonald 16 times .
under the settlements , the family of philip coleman , who was tasered by police officers while handcuffed in a jail cell in 2012 and later died after being taken to a hospital , will receive $ 4.95 million .
coleman was dragged motionless out of his cell by the handcuffs .
the tasering and dragging were caught on video cameras .
the committee also approved $ 1.5 million for the family of justin cook , who died of an asthma attack after being arrested in 2014 .
the suit claimed that police did not provide appropriate medical attention .
the full city council will vote on the settlements on wednesday .
high-profile killings of black men by mainly white police officers in u.s. cities have prompted a national debate and protests about the use of excessive force by police .
