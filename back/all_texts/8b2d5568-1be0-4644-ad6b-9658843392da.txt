The most infamous leader of the Ku Klux Klan has just proven that the biggest bullies have the thinnest skins.
Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, a Trump-loving white supremacist who spent a good chunk of his life leading a hate group, apparently doesn t like to be called bad names because it hurts his feelings.Duke let Americans in on his sensitive side when the ex-KKK leader spoke about the fact that Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had held off on calling Duke names like deplorable (even though Pence has disavowed Duke s support, unlike his boss).
In return for his kindness and compassion, Duke praised Pence extensively on his radio show for refusing the call Duke exactly what he is.
Duke said: The whole idea that they were trying to make Pence call me names basically, and he didn t bite on that, was a real positive thing for all of us.
The secret alliance between Duke and the Trump campaign is disgusting, and it has had disastrous effects.
Because he was so inspired by Trump s racist and hateful presidential campaign, Duke is now running for the Senate and why wouldn t he, when several Americans have been so accepting of the racist and anti-Semitic views that Trump holds as well?
The Trump campaign has basically paved the way for people like Duke!You can listen to Duke rave about Pence below:The terrifying thing about Trump s campaign is that the GOP nominee has literally made it ok for hate speech and bigotry to be expressed publicly.
He has, in many ways, normalized it in his campaign speeches, his violence-provoking rallies, and by sharing white supremacist and anti-minority messages on social media on a regular basis.
Trump has made room for the most awful, divisive views to be expressed and given people like Duke the guts to have platforms they never would dared to pursue before.
This is the America that Trump is creating and it s not great.
It s terrifying.Featured image via screenshot
