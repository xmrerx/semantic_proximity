moscow ( reuters ) - the head of russia s central election commission urged president vladimir putin on monday to ensure all investigations into election violations detected in russia last month were completed , and the kremlin leader promised to do so .
russia voted in local elections in many regions on sept. 10 in what was widely seen as a dress rehearsal for next year s presidential vote , with kremlin-backed candidates for regional parliaments and governorships performing strongly .
putin is the strong favorite to win re-election in march , although he has so far declined to say if he will run .
on sept. 10 , reuters reporters observed the vote at six polling stations .
in all six , they found discrepancies , of varying sizes , between the official vote tally and the number of voters the reporters counted .
we have practically tied up many loose ends of that campaign , but small ends still remain , russian media quoted ella pamfilova , head of the central election commission , as telling putin at a meeting in the kremlin .
i really would like our prosecutor general s office and the investigative committee to bring the matter to completion in a number of cases , she said , referring to inquiries into local election violations .
she did not elaborate .
all orders will be given regarding this issue , putin replied .
