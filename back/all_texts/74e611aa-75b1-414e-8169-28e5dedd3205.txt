Donald Trump s disgusting Muslim ban is being criticized far and wide, as protests and petitions against it have sprung up not only all over the country, but all over the world.One of Trump s own peers, Celebrity Apprentice host Arnold Schwarzenegger, has just weighed in on Trump s ban, and it s particularly brutal.
Schwarzenegger himself was once in immigrant as many of us were and he added his thoughts about what is truly an unjust, vile way to express hatred and xenophobia.In an interview with Mario Lopez, Schwarzenegger bashed Trump and his administration s incompetent and humiliating rollout of his executive order on immigration, which only led to chaos and public outcry.
Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California, stated that Trump s ban was vetted badly and that there is another way to going about it to do it the right way and accomplish all of the goals.
I think they were hasty with it.
Schwarzenegger then gave his own personal experience of immigrating to the United States in 1968 and shamed Trump for his clumsy delivery.
He said: To go and to ban people that have a green card that means that the United States of America has given you permission to work here permanently in this country and you are on the way to permanent citizenship I was in that position It s crazy, it s crazy and makes us look stupid when the White House is ill-prepared to put these kind of executive orders out there.
Schwarzenegger said he hoped Trump and his moronic helpers would learn from this incident and use it as a wake-up call .
Judging from the amount of protests and outcry that was generated from Trump s Muslim ban, America will only stand for more inclusive policies.
