House Republicans are gathering closely around a bill that would essentially block President Barack Obama from releasing any more detainees from Guantanamo Bay until Congress can create a new defense policy bill.Even though the House passed the bill on a 244 to 174 vote, some leading Republican House members acknowledge that it stands almost no chance of being approved by the Senate.Despite that possibility the House s vote represents a final stand in the eight-year struggle between Republicans and President Barack Obama, who have fought rigorously over the future of the detention facility housing suspected terrorists that Obama has sworn to shut down.
The White House has also threatened to veto this attempt as well.In August, the president approved the largest single transfer of detainees, 15 total were sent to the United Arab Emirates, leaving the population at 61.
Two of those released from Guantanamo Bay now join others that have reengaged in terrorist activity.The bill s sponsor, Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind, states We wouldn t be seeing 30 percent recidivism if we had true partners in this cause and in these countries.
He continues by saying that Obama s detainee transfer policy is more about the president running out of time to fulfill his campaign promise than about the national security interest of the United States, and that puts Americans at risk.
Let s hope that the bill either passes or holds Obama off long enough for his term to end.H/T [ Breaking 911 ]
