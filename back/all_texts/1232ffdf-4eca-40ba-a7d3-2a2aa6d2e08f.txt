No matter how much they don t want to admit it to be true, many Republicans, especially in Congress, know Hillary Clinton is the better choice for president despite what they may say publicly.Oh sure, they ll fall in line behind Donald Trump for the sake of the party, but do they really believe the reality television host and floundering businessman will make a good Commander-in-Chief?Proving this point, several GOP Senators are even admitting that they know Hillary will be good to work with.Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that he s worked with Hillary in the past and sees a similar future: The one thing you have to remember is that for five years she was Secretary of State while we were in the Senate.
We had to work together an awful lot while members of the Foreign Relations Committee and also as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Adding that it will be much different than when President Obama took office: Barack Obama was somewhat of an unknown he was a senator, but only for a year-and-a-half before he was elected president.
She is a known commodity, and I think there ll be more camaraderie in terms of working together, than there might have been in the early days of Obama.
As we can all probably recall, there was little to no respect for President Obama from the Republican side of the aisle in both the House and the Senate.
In fact, it seemed their number one priority was to block any and everything he tried to get accomplished.Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) said of a Hillary Clinton presidency: We ll do our duty, you know regardless of who is president.
The people we serve want us to to work together for their benefit so that s certainly my posture.
Even Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) admitted that he s worked with Hillary in the past and that she d be a willing partner on things such as immigration reform and federal spending.Now, of course, most Republicans will still tell you that Donald Trump will win, but they are clearly, and rightfully, preparing for a Hillary Clinton presidency.
Because let s be real, that s not only the most likely case scenario but also what will be best for the nation overall.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images
