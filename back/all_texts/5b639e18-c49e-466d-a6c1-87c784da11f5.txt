The domestic terrorists currently occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon sure are soft.
As their occupation stretches out, they have been sending around supply lists.
These requests include everything from clean underwear to shampoo and conditioner.
In fact, the mother of lead occupier Ammon Bundy has been making sure the militants are comfortable, by helping them beg for the things they need to keep breaking the law.Cue Stephen Colbert s endless supply of comedy.
And no, Bundy s mother was not off limits.
With regards to her helping spread the word about needed supplies, Colbert said: She would deliver the items herself, but the clubhouse sign clearly says, No girls allowed.
Colbert then went on to mock the militants requests for things like shampoo and conditioner, saying: It s one thing to face off against the jackbooted thugs of the tyrannical government, (but) it s another to have to fight the frizzies.
You want hair to bounce and behave.
They really gave the Late Show host plenty of material when they begged for French Vanilla coffee creamer and throw rugs.
They re either starting a revolution, or they re opening a bed and breakfast.
It s just like Patrick Henry said: Give me French vanilla or give me hazelnut they re both yummy.
Doesn t get much better than that.
These people are nothing but a running joke, but, hey, at least it s great fodder for late night comedians.Watch the hilarity below:Featured image via video screen capture
