donald trump took to twitter to defend his muslim ban on sunday morning and got his ass handed to him by pissed off americans.on friday , trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people from seven countries from entering the united states just because they happen to be muslims.trump claims that the order is necessary to keep americans safe , but none of the countries listed are responsible for terrorist attacks against american citizens .
in fact , all of the mass shootings in cities like orlando , ft .
hood , and san bernardino were carried out by natural born american citizens .
furthermore , trump left saudi arabia off the list even though the 9/11 hijackers originated from and were funded by the saudis.in short , trump s order does not keep america safe and has only caused chaos around the world while violating the rights of americans.but trump dared to defend his ban anyway.our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting , now .
look what is happening all over europe and , indeed , the world a horrible mess !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 29 , 2017except that our country already has strong borders and immigrants already go through extreme vetting to get here .
refugees have to wait up to two years while they are strenuously investigated by several government agencies .
terrorism won t stop because of a wall or more vetting .
but it will increase because trump s ban will be used as propaganda by terrorist organizations to justify more attacks against america.and the reality is that trump s order has made the world a bigger mess because people and businesses are scrambling to deal with the complications and families are experiencing fear that they ll never see their loved ones again due to the ban .
airports across the country are also a mess because people are being detained and blocked from entering the country , even those who have green cards and are permanent residents.the american people are already sick and tired of trump and they absolutely put a boot up his ass on twitter .
@ realdonaldtrump the people your order blocks from entering the us have lived here legally , sometimes for decades .
hank green ( @ hankgreen ) january 29 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump they are newborns , college professors , employees , the elderly , and war heroes .
they also believe in the dream of america .
hank green ( @ hankgreen ) january 29 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump one detainee was given asylum in the us after 10 years of assisting the us military in iraq , an often deadly job .

@ realdonaldtrump you re right that the world is a horrible mess .
we therefore have a moral duty to help those fleeing war and persecution .
simon hedlin ( @ simonhedlin ) january 29 , 2017 .
@ realdonaldtrump when jews fled from nazism , the u.s. sent refugees back to europe to die in the holocaust .
