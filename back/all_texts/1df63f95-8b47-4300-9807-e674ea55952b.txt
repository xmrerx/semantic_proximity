WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S.
Senator John McCain said on Monday he would offer a plan for a U.S. strategy in the war in Afghanistan as an amendment to a defense authorization bill in September.
“Eight years of a ‘don’t lose’ strategy has cost us lives and treasure in Afghanistan,” McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.
“When the Senate takes up the National Defense Authorization Act in September, I will offer an amendment based on the advice of some our best military leaders that will provide a strategy for success in achieving America’s national interests in Afghanistan.”
