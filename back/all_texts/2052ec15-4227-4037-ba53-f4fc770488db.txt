Texas Civil Rights lawyer, Rob Ranco made a really bad move last Friday evening when he took to twitter to make a disgusting comment about Betsy DeVos: I m not wishing for it but I d be ok if #BetsyDevos was sexually assaulted.
A screenshot of the tweet is below.
Ranco suddenly deleted his twitter account the next morning.
Luckily, the tweet was captured before he deleted it.Ranco had more to say to Education Secretary DeVos: Make the world more dangerous for my daughters intentionally and your well being is not my concern.
Full stop.
Ranco was responding to DeVos reversal of an OBAMA policy that intervened in local school procedures by imposing un-American, unfair, and downright scary rules that automatically ruin the lives of male college students so long as any wack job nut accuses him of something.
Kangeroo college tribunals railroad these people.
That was OBAMA s doing.
DaVos is thankfully doing something to reverse that travesty.On campus, one rape, one assault, one gone w/o due process, is one too many.
~Betsy DeVos Yes, the left HATES this.
