I WILL STAND WITH AMERICA BECAUSE I KNEEL ATTENTION STARVED SHEILA JACKSON LEERep.
Sheila Jackson Lee just couldn t stand it anymore She just had to pull out her race card and kneel on the House floor today to show solidarity with the NFL players who kneeled during the national anthem over the weekend.We noticed a coordinated move last night with the main stream media and politicians to make this into Trump is a racist for calling the players sons of bitches We heard dog whistle so many times it became funny.
ALL of the cable channels had Dem talking heads claiming Trump spoke directly to ONLY the black players when he condemned the protest.
THEY EVEN BROUGHT THE MOTHERS OF PLAYERS INTO THIS LOL: We simply ask for the dignity and respect to not call our mothers a son-of-a-B.
Even though President Trump NEVER made this about race, you knew it would happen, didn t you?
The left has nothing else nothing!!
!WHAT DID SHE JUST SAY??
?Jackson Lee explained.
The only reason he is doing is because someone had the lack of judgment to provoke the situation and call their mothers a name.
I refuse to accept that as a standard of leadership for the highest office in the world.
Jackson Lee continued by saying: there is no basis in the First Amendment that says you cannot kneel in the national anthem or in front of the flag.
I kneel in honor of them.
I kneel in front of the flag and on this floor, Jackson Lee declared while taking a knee.
I kneel in honor of the First Amendment.
I kneel because the flag is a symbol for freedom.
I kneel because I m going to stand against racism.
I kneel because I will stand with those young men and I ll stand with our soldiers.
And I ll stand with America, because I kneel, Lee concluded.
