i m a political refugee from iran .
i ve been to prison .
i ve been under islamic law .
and i know how it starts , and i know how it ends .
and it always starts with uh , for some reason unity of the left and islamists and it scares me .
so , i came here to be free .
i chose canada as my second home to live in a free country , and uh , i m beginning to get really scared .
because the way things are going , it looks like they re going to basically appease islamists , just to not raise any ruckus .
they [ islamists ] see it as a sign of weakness , so they re [ islamists ] are just gong to take more and more watch : iranian immigrant warns the west .
islamofascism `` always starts with the unity of leftists & islamists . ''
