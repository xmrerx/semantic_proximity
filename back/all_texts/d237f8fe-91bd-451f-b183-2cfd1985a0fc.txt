After Donald Trump declared that he would do far worse things than waterboarding, it has left the questioned to be begged, what should be done to gain intelligence that doesn t involve torture?
A very valid question, and one that our intelligence community probably grapples with daily considering, no, you can t torture people to gather intelligence.When posed with this question on CNN, Ben Carson replied that he would promote a much more humane medical way of intelligence gathering.Pressed on what this medical way would be by CNN s Poppy Harlow, Carson responded: I believe there are a number of ways to extract information.
Including, you know, some medical ways of, you know, putting people into a less than conscious state which allows information to be extracted much more humanely.
Carson was then asked to explain further, so he said: Well, the average person might understand it as truth serum.
But, you know, there are ways where you decrease a person s conscious defenses and they might be much more willing to give up information.
Seemingly perplexed by the concept of a truth serum as though it were coming from a Harry Potter novel, Harlow again asked Carson to explain in greater detail what he means.
Carson explained: Sodium amytal, but you know there are a variety of different things we can use now.
We ve made some advances in that kind of science.
So, instead of torture people, Carson is advocating drugging them against their will.
It may seem more humane, but it s not necessarily more ethical.Carson never did actually answer the question regarding if waterboarding should be used, and pivoted away into a non-answer of I don t think we necessarily need to be broadcasting what we do.
Well, okay then.
Why answer questions anyway?
