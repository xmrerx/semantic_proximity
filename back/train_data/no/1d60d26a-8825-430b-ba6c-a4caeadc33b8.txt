remember when children of the president or president-elect used to be off limits to the press or even those who may have objected to the the views of the president ?
i wonder how rosie would feel about someone spreading a totally unfounded rumor about one of her children all over social media melania trump has hired a famous lawyer who is now threatening a lawsuit over a video suggesting her 10-year-old son , barron , is autistic , and the letter calls out rosie o donnellas a bully.according to the letter , obtained by tmz , the youtube video falsely insinuates barron is autistic .
the letter , and our sources familiar with the situation , say barron absolutely is not autistic.rosie tweeted out the video last week , with a caption , barron trump autistic ?
the letter says , the video allegedly seeks to stop the bullying of barron trump .
not true the video did instigate further bullying by rosie o donnell and others .
https : //youtu.be/yzad5pu9iw4the video lists a number of signs it claims points to autism , including barron clapping without slapping his hands together .
melania s attorney , charles j .
harder , says barron did this once at the end of a long day at the rnc but the vast majority of the time , he claps normally .
the video shows barron yawning and grimacing during his father s victory speech at the rnc and on election night .
melania s team says both events were late at night , and barron was exhibiting normal behavior for a 10-year-old.melania is not threatening to sue rosie , but her attorney , harder , wants the person who posted the youtube clip to delete it and post an apology.our sources say melania is outraged and is serious about going after the person who posted the video if he doesn t take it down .
