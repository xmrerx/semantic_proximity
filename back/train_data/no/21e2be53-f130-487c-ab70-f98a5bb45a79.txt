kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - an australian mother of three escaped the death penalty on wednesday after a malaysian court found her not guilty of drug trafficking .
maria elvira pinto exposto , 54 , was found with more than 1 kg of methamphetamine in her backpack while in transit in kuala lumpur enroute to melbourne from shanghai in december 2014 .
under malaysian law , anyone found guilty of possessing more than 50 grams of illegal drugs is considered a trafficker and faces a mandatory death penalty .
the law was amended last month to do away with the mandatory death sentence , allowing judges to use their own discretion .
but the changes have not yet come into effect .
exposto s lawyers said she was the victim of an internet romance scam and was lured into carrying a bag containing drugs unknowingly by a friend of her online boyfriend , who claimed to be a u.s. soldier serving in afghanistan .
i agreed with the defense s argument that the accused had no knowledge of the drugs that were in her bag , judge ghazali cha said on wednesday .
exposto s conduct during her arrest showed she was naive and her behavior was that of an innocent person , he said .
the judge referred exposto to malaysia s immigration department for deportation .
i m happy now that i m free , exposto said in brief comments to reporters .
three australian nationals have been executed by malaysia for drug trafficking : kevin barlow and brian chambers in 1986 , and michael mcauliffe in 1993 .
