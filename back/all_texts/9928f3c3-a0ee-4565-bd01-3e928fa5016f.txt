WQOW -A Lacrosse, WI transgender person, who recently announced her primary campaign against Congressional Representative Ron Kind, is now in custody of the NYPD on grand larceny charges.Juliet D Germanotta, 36, was arrested on February 12 by the La Crosse County Sheriff s Department at 400 La Crosse Street.
That arrest followed a call to the DA s office from the NYPD saying that Germanotta was wanted for grand larceny in the third degree.According to the New York Post, a congressional candidate from Wisconsin was busted by the NYPD in her home state when she tried to sell a ring she ripped off from a Manhattan jewelry store, police said Wednesday.Juliet Germanotta who in campaign literature vowed to keep the state fiscally responsible by questioning expenses had ordered a $4,800, 18-karat yellow gold Zambian emerald and diamond ring from Mikaelians Jewelry on West 47th Street in Midtown on Sept. 19.But Germanotta, 36, who describes herself as a proud transgender woman, claimed the ring she received was not to her liking and requested her money back from the store.Instead of sending the real ring back, she sent the store a $10 replica and sold the original, cops said.Mikaelians filed a complaint with the NYPD on Oct. 2, recognizing the ring they received in return as a phony.
And when Germanotta s buyer in Wisconsin had the real ring appraised, it was learned that the jewelry was hot.NYPD detectives picked up Germanotta in Wisconsin, where she confessed to the crime, authorities said.She waived extradition in court Tuesday.
