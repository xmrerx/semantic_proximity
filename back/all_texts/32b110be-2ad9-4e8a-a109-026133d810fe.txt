The election of former reality television star Donald Trump stirred up a variety of emotions in American voters and most of them were bad.
Everyone that voted against Trump which was the majority of Americans likely felt combinations of disbelief, depression, disgust, fear, and anger that such an unqualified, undeserving human being could somehow come out on top despite losing the popular vote.Recently on the WTF podcast, singer Bruce Springsteen summed up how many of us feel about Trump s upcoming presidency perfectly.
When host Marc Maron asked him if he was scared of what the new Commander in Chief might mean for the future of our country, Springsteen said, Yeah.
Of course.
How could you not be?
Then Sprucesteen elaborated, dropping the devastating truthbomb that all of us feel.
He continued: I ve felt disgust before, but never the kind of fear that you feel now.
It s as simple as the fear of, is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job?
Do they simply have the pure competence to be put in the position of such responsibility?
Remarking on the fear mongering tactics that Trump used to appeal to his gullible supporters, Springsteen said he understood why Trump was able to attract support from his voters, but made sure to acknowledge the fact that they d all been played for fools.
He said: I think if you were effected deeply by the industrialization, globalization, and the technological advances, and you have been left behind; and somebody comes along and tells you I m gonna bring all the jobs back.
Don t worry about it.
They re all coming back.
You re concerned about America changing, the browning of America I m gonna build a wall.
These are all very simplistic, but very powerful and simple ideas.
They re lies.
They can t occur.
