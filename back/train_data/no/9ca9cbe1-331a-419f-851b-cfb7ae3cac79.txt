amsterdam ( reuters ) - the dutch government said on wednesday it is joining austria s lawsuit against germany at the european court of justice over plans for a road toll for foreign drivers .
the toll would apply to foreign-registered cars using german highways at a cost of up to 130 euros ( 116.5 ) a year .
german drivers will be able to recover the costs through tax deductions .
at the heart of the dutch objection is that the german toll plan is in violation of european rules , a statement said .
the dutch government believes just as austria does that the toll plans are discriminatory and violate the basic right to free movement .
the toll also will create an impediment to free trade , with 60-100 million euros in estimated annual costs for dutch taxpayers , largely hurting people and businesses in the border region , the statement said .
the german parliament approved the road toll in march , but it is unlikely to come into effect before 2019 , the year a ruling by the court is expected .
