Well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality.Here is The Simpsons new opening with Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard, BEING RIGHT SUCKS :The Simpsons updates its 2000 prediction of a Trump Presidency #TheSimpsons pic.twitter.com/Myf5rYb9Dj The Simpsons (@TheSimpsons) November 14, 2016Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman who s not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the future s looking pretty bleak.Here s the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy:Early on into Trump s campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump s hair.
If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality.Now we have to reap what we ve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league.Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.Featured image via video screen capture
