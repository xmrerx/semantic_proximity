I heard later that she might have said I know who she is.
Since this was not any fault of mine, the way the individual continued to act appeared to be, upon reflection, because I was an African American woman, Sheila Jackson Lee (@JacksonLeeTX18) December 26, 2017Via Washington Times:The woman Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee accused of racism is a celebrated photojournalist who helped document human-rights abuses in war-torn Guatemala during the 1980s.Jean-Marie Simon, whose first-class seat on a United Airlines flight was given to Ms. Jackson Lee, Texas Democrat, lived and worked in Guatemala during the turbulent decade that saw the military seize control of the government in a coup.

[ ]After bartering with Ms. Simon over the amount of the voucher she would receive as compensation, United eventually placed the disgruntled passenger in Economy Plus.
The airline has yet to apologize for the incident.
I was the last passenger on the plane, Ms. Simon wrote on Facebook.
A Texas congressman, a nice guy, sat down next to me.
He said was glad I had made it on the flight.
I showed him my boarding pass with my seat, 1A, printed on it.
He said, You know what happened, right?
Do you know who s in your seat?
I said no.
