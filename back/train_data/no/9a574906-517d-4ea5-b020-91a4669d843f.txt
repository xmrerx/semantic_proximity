brussels ( reuters ) - a belgian judge will decide by monday on spain s arrest warrant for sacked catalan leader carles puigdemont and his associates after they turned themselves in to belgian police , a spokesman for brussels prosecutors said on sunday .
on friday , spain handed over to belgian prosecutors the warrant for rebellion , sedition , misuse of public funds , disobedience and breach of trust relating to catalonia s independence campaign for puigdemont and four of his associates .
this morning the five people wanted by spain presented themselves to police in brussels .
they were put in custody at 9.17 this morning , prosecutor spokesman gilles dejemeppe told a news conference .
the judge will hear the people this afternoon .
he has until tomorrow morning to decide , he said , without naming the people .
if the judge decides to issue an arrest warrant on the basis of the spanish request , the case then goes to a court which must decide within 15 days whether to execute the order .
puigdemont can appeal at various stages of the proceedings , a process which can take many weeks .
