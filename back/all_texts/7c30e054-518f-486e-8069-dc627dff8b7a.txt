21st Century Wire says This is the news that the elite political establishment did not want to hear.Watch a video of this report here:A new poll by Rasmussen Reports has Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton by two points in a head-to-head matchup.Trump comes in at 41% with Clinton trailing behind with 39%.15% of respondents would prefer some other candidate, while 5% were undecided.Last week, Rasmussen ran the same poll and the candidates were evenly split with 38% each.Other polls have suggested that Trump has no chance of beating Hillary, but this latest development certainly brings those conclusions into question.The elite political establishment class is definitely going to be worried by this news, and the ridiculous attacks levelled against Trump may be about to reach new heights.Most worrying for those elites is the thought of America getting along with other countries, something that Trump has explicitly stated he wants to do as president.This means an end to foreign adventurism that has made the military industrial complex such a force to be reckoned with in modern America.Trump has even said that he wants to promote stability around the world and not change, implicitly suggesting that supporting foreign terrorist groups to overthrow nations is the wrong move.This new poll means that this drastic change to American foreign policy direction is one step closer to becoming reality, and with Trump himself promising to crush Crooked Hillary Clinton in the debates this could be just the start of things to come.GET THE FULL STORY ON THE ELECTION: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files
