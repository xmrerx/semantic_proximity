What would Ellen s motive be for addressing Hillary s strange public affection for Aguilera s bosoms, other than to endear her to the lesbian viewers?
Of course, this calls into question yet again, Hillary s politically motivated, sham of a marriage to Bill.
Look, we couldn t care less if Hillary is a lesbian.
It s just another lie she s been living, on top of a million other lies.
If it s true, (and there sure is a lot of evidence, as well as insiders who have come forward to say it is) America should question her political motivation for keeping it a secret for so many years, given she has become such a vocal advocate of gay rights over the past 8 years.
It just goes to her rotten, lying character.
Ellen didn t seem to suffer any ill effects by being honest with her fans, and she can certainly live with a clear conscience .something Hillary will never be able to do.
Cough cough #Benghazi!Ellen: There s a picture of you was it you staring at Hillary or you staring at Hillary?
Christina: She was staring at my bosoms.
Ellen: I know you just had a fundraiser for her at your house.
Christina: I did, I did.
She s amazing.
Ellen: That s fantastic.
Leaving many of Ellen s viewers wondering, Why is that fantastic' ?
