White House counselor Kellyanne Conway likes to call her critics sexist but she s always stood by amateur president Donald Trump s misogynistic attacks.
In May, Conway said that CNN s Anderson Cooper was sexist because he rolled his eyes.
Conway s boss unleashed an appalling personal attack on MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski Thursday that left even some Republicans speechless.
Melania Trump has undergone numerous cosmetic surgeries, but her husband bashed low IQ Crazy Mika for bleeding after an alleged facelift.
Then he went on to attack Psycho Joe Scarborough.While even House Speaker Paul Ryan said Trump s tweets this morning were not appropriate, Conway couldn t answer the question from a TMZ reporter.The video published by TMZ shows Conway turning herself into a pretzel trying to dodge the question as she headed as quickly as possible for the elevator.
But halfway there she gave what she called a bipartisan hug to Rep. Debbie Dingell.
That s right, she even hugged a Democrat to get out of answering the simple question about the former reality show star unleashing highly inappropriate mean-girl tweets this morning.
Look, Conway said, a bipartisan hug.
The elevator wasn t on the ground floor yet so Conway had to wait impatiently for it while she was still questioned about her boss s tweets, so naturally, she brought up the weather.
It s a gorgeous day here, she said.Back in May, Conway said, I face sexism a lot of times when I show up for interviews like that, of her interview with Anderson Cooper.
And now it s a little more than a month later and she s strangely quiet after the alleged president launched a personal attack on Mika Brzezinski simply because she s critical of the former reality show star.
While Conway blasts the media over negative coverage, Trump is supposedly the president of the United States and Mika is the co-host of a cable show only one of them is supposed to act presidential.Image via screen capture.
