meanwhile in america , the left is doing the very same thing but in a much more inconspicuous way .
they ve made every effort to remove christianity from the public s view .
they ve removed christianity from school organizations , public places , and now , in the marketing of products specifically related to religious holidays for the christian consumer cadbury was inundated with furious comments from customers on twitter , questioning why the easter treats simply said milk chocolate egg with no mention of the christian festival .
one said : some of us want to know why easter is hidden on the back now ?
why change a good thing ? ?
while another commented : disgusting you ve dropped the word easter .cadbury sent endless replies to irate shoppers denying claims that they have a policy to remove the easter slogan on packaging.they wrote on their twitter : easter s on the back of our packaging with the other product details.both cadbury and nestle denied that they were getting rid of the word easter from their products .
the word easter is not included on the front of the packaging for their mini eggs giant egg or their dairy milk buttons egg , but happy easter is branded on a special edition of the dairy milk chocolate bar .
it s not on the front as the seasonal design shows what it is .
as a seasonal treat the eggs will always be linked with easter .
however customers remained unconvinced , accusing the company of hiding any mention of easter on the back.both cadbury and nestle denied that they were getting rid of the word easter from their products .
