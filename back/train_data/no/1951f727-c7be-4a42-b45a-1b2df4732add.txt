dubai ( reuters ) - the ruler of oman received iran s foreign minister on monday , the state news agency ona reported , in a rare official appearance for the long-time leader .
sultan qaboos , who is in his late 70s , was pictured in conversation with iran s javad zarif at al-shumoukh fort in the state of manah , south-west of oman s capital , muscat .
the agency said qaboos and zarif discussed cooperation between the two countries and regional issues , but gave no further details .
zarif was due to visit qatar on the second leg of his gulf tour .
qatar has grown closer to iran since saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and bahrain imposed sanctions on doha in june , accusing it of supporting terrorism , a charge it denies .
in the past two years , qaboos has been to germany several times for medical checks , fuelling concern over succession in the u.s-allied state .
he has no children and has not publicly appointed a successor .
