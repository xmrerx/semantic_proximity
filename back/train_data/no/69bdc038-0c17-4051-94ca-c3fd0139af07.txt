minneapolis mayoral candidate raymond dehn proposes disarming cops in wake of damond shooting .
only one year ago , the fbi named minneapolis , mn as one of the most dangerous cities in america .
minneapolis is also home to the largest somali refugee population in america .
according to the star tribune , minnesota remains near the top among states for refugee resettlement , measured as a share of state population .
it is also the top destination for refugees who move from the state where they were originally resettled .
of the 2,338 total , almost 45 percent hailed from somalia.in the wake of the shooting death of australian justine damond , raymond dehn , a candidate in the race for minneapolis mayor has proposed disarming police officersthe australian woman was shot dead by police officer mohamed noor after calling 911 to report a suspected sexual assault .
officers don t need to carry a gun on their person all the time , said raymond dehn , one of the frontrunners in the mayoral race and who currently serves in the minnesota house of representatives .
currently , officers carry all sorts of assault weapons in their cars .
so why can t one of those weapons be the side arm ( such as a baton that sits on a holster ) ?
it s important that we begin to have a conversation , and i would say that all things are on the table .
we live in a culture where guns are pervasive .
cops carrying guns is part of a larger conversation about guns in our society , he said , according to the star tribune .better yet , how about just disarm the cops who , like mohamed noor , are only on the force to demonstrate minneapolis commitment to diversity , rather than because they re competent to be police officers ? even better still , how about hire and fire cops based on merit , rather than for their value as trophy muslims or somalis on the force ? nah that would be islamophobic .
