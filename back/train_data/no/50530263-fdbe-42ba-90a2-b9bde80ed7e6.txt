another great move by the trump administration !
they were proactive in securing the release of aya hijazi .
hijazi s release was negotiated with egypt by president trump and his aides.they worked for several weeks with egyptian president abdel fatah al-sissi ( pictured above ) to secure the freedom of aya hijazi , 30 , a u.s. citizen , as well as her husband , mohamed hassanein , who is egyptian , and four other humanitarian workers .
trump dispatched a u.s. government aircraft to cairo to bring hijazi and her family to washington.the obama administration unsuccessfully pressed sissi s government for their release .
it was not until trump moved to reset u.s. relations with egypt by embracing sissi at the white house on april 3 he publicly hailed the autocrat s leadership as fantastic and offered the u.s. government s strong backing that egypt s posture changed .
