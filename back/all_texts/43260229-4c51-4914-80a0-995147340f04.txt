If there s one thing Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump likes to boast, it s that he s not afraid of anything or anyone.
He likes to hold this bravado that he is incapable of being scared, that he s willing to take on the world, and that anyone who dares to cross him better watch out.However, as it turns out this outward bravado may also be a falsification of his true character, as most people who are truly terrified do to overcompensate.
As he tells his supporters to go after protesters who come to his rally, he hides behind the podium and/or doesn t show up to an event at all.
Then, when faced with someone who actually approached him at an event he, quite literally, look terrified and cowered away.Well, because the internet is full of hilarious geniuses, someone just put together a GIF of what may truly be the funniest thing so far this year to hit the world wide web.
It shows Trump at a recent rally when a protester started to approach the stage and his security surrounded him, but this time it shows Bernie Sanders creep onto the stage and scare the living daylights out of the real estate mogul.Check it out for yourself.
