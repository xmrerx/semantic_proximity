washington ( reuters ) - the united states is calling on all sides in yemen to re-energize political talks to end the country s civil war , a trump administration official said on monday , after former president ali abdullah saleh was killed in a roadside attack .
analysts said saleh s death would be a huge morale boost for the iran-aligned houthis , since saleh had switched sides by abandoning the houthis in favor of a saudi-led coalition .
the u.s. official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , added that houthi claims on sunday they launched a missile at abu dhabi demonstrated how destabilizing this war is for the region and how the iranian regime is exploiting the war for its own political ambitions .
