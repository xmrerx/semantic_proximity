Newt Gingrich has been one of Donald Trump s most vocal cheerleaders, but in a new book, he threw his President under the bus by revealing the real reason Trump ran for President, and it s far worse than you think.
Trump clearly thinks the presidency is a toy that he could buy because it s more fun than buying a yacht.
His response was priceless, Gingrich writes in Understanding Trump, in an excerpt published by ABC News on Sunday.
After a moment of thought, he said, $70 [million] to 80 million: that would be a yacht.
This would be a lot more fun than a yacht!
He also noted how Trump ran his campaign like a corporation ahead of schedule and under budget.
Describing a phone conversation he had with Trump after the South Carolina primary in February 2016, Gingrich said the presidential candidate said he was indeed under budget.
At the tail end of our conversation, he jokingly said, By the way, I know you said I needed to spend $80 million, but I ve only spent $30 million.
I feel kind of bad, Gingrich quoted Trump, who won the South Carolina primary, as having said.Source: MarketWatchThat explains a lot.
It explains why Trump is woefully unprepared to be president.
It also explains why he seems to think the office is his ticket to getting even richer.Trump doesn t read.
He doesn t pay attention to National Security Briefings unless his name is plastered all over the briefings, preferably with pictures.Nearly every meeting he s had with a world leader has been a disaster.
He s offended all of our allies and he s helped accomplish the Russian goal of destabilizing the country.
He also has the most corrupt presidency in history.While Trump might be having fun after spending less than he might have spent on a yacht, it s clear his presidency comes at the expense of the American people and of our reputation as the world s largest superpower.
In other words, he s playing a very scary game and he simply doesn t care.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images
