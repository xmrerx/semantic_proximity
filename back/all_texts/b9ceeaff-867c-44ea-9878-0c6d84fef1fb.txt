Soros isn t just a danger to America he s a danger to the entire world.
Billionaire investor George Soros has confirmed he wants to bring down Europe s borders, following the accusation made last week by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.Last week, Mr Orban accused Mr Soros who was born in Hungary of deliberately encouraging the migrant crisis.
This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other by those (human rights) activists who support everything that weakens the nation-state, Mr Orban said.
This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros.
Mr Soros has now issued an email statement to Bloomberg Business, claiming his foundations help uphold European values , while Mr Oban s actions in strengthening the Hungarian border and stopping a huge migrant influx undermine those values.
His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle, Mr Soros added.
Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.
