Holy f*ckballs, it hasn t even been a week since President Asterisk was inaugurated and he s already talking about martial law.
Trump s presidency is off to a great start for people who like to sit back and watch the world burn (special shout-out to Jill Stein voters).
Trump has taken the first step via executive orders to dismantling Obamacare, begun destroying our environment with two massive pipeline projects, and financially crippled any international health organization that so much as mentions abortion, and all of that is pretty f*cking scary, but a tweet he sent out Tuesday night is downright horrifying.
If Chicago doesn t fix the horrible carnage going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!
Trump tweeted.If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017There are a couple of problems with this.
First off, he got his facts wrong (there have been 37 murders in Chicago so far this year, not 42).
Oh, yeah, and he threatened to actually declare martial law in Barack Obama s hometown.
Republicans screamed for years that Barack Obama was going to declare martial law, and Trump hasn t been able to go a week without tossing out that sort of threat.
Naturally, people aren t happy about this, and the response to Trump s remarkably horrible-even-for-him tweet is not good :@realDonaldTrump Republicans spent the last 8 years saying that Obama was going to declare martial law.
Then you say this Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump HOLY SHIT LITERALLY MARTIAL LAW Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Spoken like a true fascist.

@realDonaldTrump Chicago youth needs someone to believe in them and support them.
Not call them thugs and threaten to call in the guard.
Al x Young (@AlexYoung) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump I would like Fascism and Martial Law for $400, Alex."

Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump See, things like this are why people are worried about your fascist, demagogue tendencies.
Kelly Scaletta (@KellyScaletta) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Better idea than martial law improve federal gun control.
The guns are coming from states like Indiana.
Ask your little buddy.

Eat "all" the "dicks" please.
Kevin P. (@kevinlpotter) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump You'll send in the Feds and do what?
Make it 7,228 shootings?
Darren Goble (@DarrensThinking) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Hitler did the same when the Reichtstag building burned in 1933.
Martial Law was declared & the rest is history.
@maddow https://t.co/WpPvDprekK markevans (@markevans08) January 25, 2017As it turns out, the feds (in this case, the Justice Department) have already been there and have diagnosed the problem with violence in Chicago: police brutality and racism, but Trump and his Republican compatriots typically dismiss such well-research opinions in favor of licking the badges of cops who make the rest look bad.What will happen when Trump sends in the feds?
Well, we don t need to look past what Hitler did after the Reichstag fire:Using emergency constitutional powers, Adolf Hitler s cabinet had issued a Decree for the Protection of the German People on February 4, 1933.
This decree placed constraints on the press and authorized the police to ban political meetings and marches, effectively hindering electoral campaigning.
A temporary measure, it was followed by a more dramatic and permanent suspension of civil rights following the February 27 burning of the parliament building.Though the origins of the fire are still unclear, in a propaganda maneuver, the coalition government (Nazis and the German Nationalist People s Party) blamed the Communists.
They exploited the Reichstag fire to secure President von Hindenburg s approval for an emergency decree, the Decree for the Protection of the People and the State of February 28.
Popularly known as the Reichstag Fire Decree, the regulations suspended the right to assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and other constitutional protections, including all restraints on police investigations.Justified on the false premise that the Communists were planning an uprising to overthrow the state, the Reichstag Fire Decree permitted the regime to arrest and incarcerate political opponents without specific charge, dissolve political organizations, and to suppress publications.
It also gave the central government the authority to overrule state and local laws and overthrow state and local governments.Donald Trump is moving quickly, and we can no longer ignore the threat he poses.
Write your legislators right now seriously, do it right now and demand that someone (anyone) begin organizing his impeachment immediately.
