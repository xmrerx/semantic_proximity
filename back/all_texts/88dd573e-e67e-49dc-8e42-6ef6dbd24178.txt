Newt goes after it with Joe Scarborough of MSNBC and simply skewers him on the race war Obama has promoted the past 7 1/2 years: Yeah.
7 1/2 years into his presidency, he began to realize now that we ve had two massacres of policemen that maybe as president of the United States and leader of law and order in America, he should say something on behalf of law and order.
I mean, that s fairly pathetic.
