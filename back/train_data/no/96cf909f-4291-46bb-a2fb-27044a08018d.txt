this is gon na be a tough pill for the left to swallow after working so hard to stack the courts in a victory for the trump administration , the supreme court on monday lifted key components of an injunction against president trump s proposed ban on travel from six majority-muslim nations , reinstating much of the policy and promising to hear full arguments as early as this fall.the court s decision means the justices will now wade into the biggest legal controversy of the trump administration the president s order temporarily restricting travel , which even trump has termed a travel ban .
today s unanimous supreme court decision is a clear victory for our national security , trump said in a statement .
as president , i can not allow people into our country who want to do us harm .
i want people who can love the united states and all of its citizens , and who will be hardworking and productive .
he added : my number one responsibility as commander in chief is to keep the american people safe .
today s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our nation s homeland .
the court made clear that a limited version of the policy can be enforced immediately with a full hearing to come in the fall .
an american individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded , the court wrote .
as to these individuals and entities , we do not disturb the injunction .
but when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the united states , for the reasons we have set out , the balance tips in favor of the government s compelling need to provide for the nation s security .
the justices decided to review the broader constitutional issues over executive authority on immigration with oral arguments to be held in the fall .
