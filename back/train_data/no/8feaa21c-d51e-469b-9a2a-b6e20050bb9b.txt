americans have been spending well over $ 2 trillion on christmas since at least 2000 , with that number topping $ 3 trillion in recent years .
but if you ask donald trump , americans rather typical spending this year is all thanks to him.seriously he took credit for christmas.the world was gloomy before i won there was no hope .
now the market is up nearly 10 % and christmas spending is over a trillion dollars !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 26 , 2016yes , all those thoughtful gifts you bought your family weren t because you would do that any year they were all because less than half of the country kinda-sorta elected the donald to lead the country for the next four years ( if we last that long ) .trump s delusions of grandeur are at this point something that invites nothing but mockery and twitter , as usual , delivered spectacularly.the world is gloomy af since you won .
and as far as the markets thanks obama !

@ realdonaldtrump honey , i know i said to buck up , but attributing everyone 's christmas presents to your big win is going a little too far .

cobamasama ( @ cobanermani456 ) december 26 , 2016 .

happy holidays ( @ thelukeleal ) december 27 , 2016 @ realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/lltqffpmyw andrea ( @ twennywonpilots ) december 27 , 2016 @ realdonaldtrump have you convinced yourself you saved christmas ?
you 're truly awful .
bob clendenin ( @ bobclendenin ) december 27 , 2016it takes a special level of delusion to genuinely believe that you saved christmas because you were elected president especially when spending is on par with previous years .
but sorry little johnny and little susie , your presents aren t under the tree because your parents want to make you happy or even because of santa .
they re there because america threw away anything resembling a moral center and elected a racist , xenophobic hatemonger to office.as for stock prices , they ve been fairly steady since about 2010 but you won t hear trump saying that , and you won t catch his idiot followers believing it.featured image via getty images ( drew angerer ) /screengrab
