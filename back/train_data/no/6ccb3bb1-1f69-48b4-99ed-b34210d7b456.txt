des moines ( reuters ) - republican front-runner candidate donald trump has a big lead in the race for the 2016 presidential nomination nationally , swamping his opponents with a 40.6 percent share of those surveyed , a reuters-ipsos tracking poll found on friday .
the survey of 582 respondents found trump with a higher percentage of the vote than his next four challengers combined , with texas senator ted cruz drawing 10.5 percent , retired neurosurgeon ben carson with 9.7 percent , former florida governor jeb bush at 9.2 percent and florida senator marco rubio with 7.2 percent .
in a hypothetical matchup between democratic front-runner hillary clinton and trump , clinton holds a statistically insignificant lead of 41.4 percent to 40.8 percent .
trump has been leading national polls of republican voters for months .
he also holds a lead in some polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire with the iowa caucuses just days away on feb. 1 .
a separate reuters-ipsos poll on friday found the u.s. economy re-emerging as a major concern for voters .
economic concerns had taken a back seat to fears of terrorism after last year â€™ s islamic state attacks in paris .
the survey of 1,614 respondents found terrorism a top concern at 20.3 percent , but the u.s. economy close behind at 18.2 percent .
