maxine waters told a tmz reporter that secretary of state rex tillerson should put threats aside and appease north korea by giving them the things that they re asking for .

pretty rich for a person who wants to spend unlimited amounts on everything else but what s most important to the u.s defense !
i want us to be very careful , very alert to what is happening and to avoid war .
i think we can do this with some diplomacy , but we have got to have tillerson , who is our secretary of state , get those positions filled for deputy , for assistant , so that we can engage with north korea .
