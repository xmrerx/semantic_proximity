if you haven t figured it out by now , donald trump loves himself a lot .
in fact , he may love himself more than anything or anyone else on this planet .
his raging narcissism is obvious and if you don t see it , well , you re probably a few sandwiches short of a picnic.so , leave it to trump to walk in and introduce his wife melania at the republican national convention by making it all about himself , not his wife.he walked in , blasphemously , to queen s we are the champions , while covered in a smoky green haze reminiscent of how a wwe wrestler would enter before a performance .. @ realdonaldtrump makes a grand entrance at the # rncincle https : //t.co/auyiktbreq https : //t.co/ceoocf87l5 cbs news ( @ cbsnews ) july 19 , 2016it was absolutely ridiculous , yet not at all surprising .
however , the internet responded appropriately , and brilliantly : he did it .
he actually did it .
trump did the wwe entrance .

pic.twitter.com/is5ijqma4m jaime fuller ( @ j_fuller ) july 19 , 2016trump 's entrance looked familiar , right ?
# rncincle pic.twitter.com/ipuwbxnhwq brian ( @ principat0 ) july 19 , 2016to put it simply , it was absurd , and just another shining example of trump s ever-expanding ego .
did he really need to walk out like that ?
of course not , but he did , because of course he did .
trump wouldn t have it any other way .
i mean , how boring if he just walked out like a normal human being , or like any other politician introducing their spouse ? if it s not clear to you by now that trump is only in this race for himself wake up.featured image via twitter
