Prudence is thirty-four.
She has had sex with twenty-one men and three women, according an assignment for high schoolers in Scotland County, Missouri.
After being celibate for three years, she meets Larry and a romance begins to develop.
Larry is thirty-seven.
One night he proposes that, things going the way he thinks they re going between them, they talk about their sexual histories.
A concerned mother recently contacted Fox News columnist Todd Starnes about the assignment after her child received it in an English class at Scotland County R-1 Junior-Senior High School.
Larry confesses to having slept with three women, one of whom he married.
She tells him that she has slept with three men.
Larry is uncomfortable with this number, especially since Prudence is younger than he is, the assignment continued.
She amends it, saying that one was just heavy petting.
Given Prudence s reflexive need for approval and Larry s clear ideas of how things should be, what percentage of the time will Prudence be inhibited in bed with Larry, and consequently fake orgasm to ease his pride?
Here is a photo of the assignment: This is something I imagine you would see on a coffee table in every brothel, the irate mother told Starnes.The unidentified woman said she contacted the school s principal, who provided a lame excuse for the assignment.
He told me that the teacher was originally a college teacher and he sometimes has trouble differentiating between what is appropriate for a 15- or 16-year-old and a 19 or 20-year-old, she said.For entire story: EAG News
