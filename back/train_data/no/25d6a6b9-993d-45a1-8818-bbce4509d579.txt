manila ( reuters ) - philippine lawmakers rejected president rodrigo duterte s choice of health secretary on tuesday , making her the fifth cabinet member to have been turned down since duterte came to power .
no reason was given for the rejection of paulyn ubial , who has been in public office for 27 years .
in the philippines , all cabinet ministers must be approved by the commission on appointments and hearings can take place long after they start work .
senator gregorio honasan , chairman of the commission s health committee , said it had decided to withhold its consent to the appointment of ubial .
he did not elaborate .
presidential spokesman ernesto abella expressed regret , saying the government was grateful for her service .
duterte has enjoyed strong opinion poll numbers since winning the presidency in last year s elections but heavy scrutiny of his war on drugs , which has killed thousands of filipinos , appears to have impacted his ratings .
trust and satisfaction in duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year , a survey showed on sunday , although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall .
lawmakers have also rejected the appointments of duterte s foreign , environment , agrarian reform and social welfare ministers .
two of the ministers were recommended by maoist rebel leaders who were still talking peace with the government .
duterte has stopped the negotiations because of continuing violence .
duterte s picks for foreign and environment ministers , alan peter cayetano and roy cimatu , have been confirmed .
