( reuters ) - former u.s. house of representative speaker dennis hastert has been released from prison in minnesota and moved to a chicago halfway house after serving a 13-month sentence for a financial crime tied to sex abuse , federal records showed on tuesday .
the 75-year-old was sentenced to 15 months at the federal medical center in rochester , minnesota in april 2016 for banking violations that revealed he sexually abused teenage boys while coaching wrestling at a high school in yorkville , illinois in the 1960s and 1970s .
he is scheduled to be held at a residential re-entry facility office in chicago until aug. 16 , according to federal bureau of prisons records on tuesday .
the records did not make clear when hastert had been transferred and officials did not immediately respond to a call for comment .
hastert , the longest-serving republican house speaker in history , pleaded guilty in 2015 to the crime of structuring , which is a form of money laundering that involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection .
the lawmaker was taking the money out of his bank accounts to pay a promised $ 3.5 million in compensation for pain and suffering to one of his five sexual abuse victims of wrestlers he coached , he admitted in his plea agreement and at his sentencing hearing .
he was never charged with sex abuse , because the statute of limitations on his alleged crimes had expired .
at the time of sentencing , u.s. district judge thomas durkin said he would have given him a longer sentence if it had not been for his age and poor health .
