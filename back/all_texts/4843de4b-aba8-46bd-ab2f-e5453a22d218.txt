When you think of who might be the perfect person to talk about who is black and who isn t, Darrell Issa probably isn t the first to come to mind.
He s likely not the second or third or even 1,453rd either.
However, the Congressman from California thought it wise to weigh in on Ben Carson s comments regarding President Obama.On an earlier Politico podcast, Carson had said that Obama was raised white and can t relate to black Americans: He s an African American.
He was, you know, raised white I mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but he didn t grow up like I grew up Many of his formative years were spent in Indonesia.
So, for him to, you know, claim that, you know, he identifies with the experience of black Americans, I think, is a bit of a stretch.
So, when CNN s Chris Cuomo brought up these remarks to Issa and asked if this was the sort of rhetoric the GOP should get behind, the Congressman had the audacity to say that Carson is a wonderful human being and he was technically correct in what he said.
Issa did insinuate that this is the sort of thing better said by a private citizen and not if you re seriously considering running for the highest office in the land, also saying that Carson isn t ready to be president.
However, the fact that Issa would have the gall to agree with Carson s sentiment is absolutely appalling, yet somehow not at all surprising.
