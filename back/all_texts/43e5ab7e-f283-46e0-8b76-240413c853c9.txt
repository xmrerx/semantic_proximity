Advocates for big government and progressive power are using the Justice Department to extort money from corporations.
It s a shakedown.
It s corrupt, pure and simple.
Tom Fitton, Judicial WatchHere s how it works: Remember when big banks were sued by the feds for supposed mortgage abuse or discrimination?
The government basically extorted money from the banks and then incentivized the banks to settle by giving the money to third-party organizations.
How convenient, right?
It was a way to redistribute billions to radical organizations like La Raza!So far, investigators have accounted for $3 billion paid to non-victim entities .
The underlying problem with the slush funds is we don t know exactly where the money is going.
Using enforcement authority to go after corporate defendants, DOJ bureaucrats are taking billions away from taxpayers to fund their pet projects overriding congressional preferences.

Somebody out to go to prison for this!
