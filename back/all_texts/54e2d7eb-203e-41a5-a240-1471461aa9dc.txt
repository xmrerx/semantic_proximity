Donald Trump got hilariously owned on Twitter again.On Sunday morning, Trump took a break from playing golf to post a Twitter rant.
First, he bragged about his presidency.The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt.
Many new jobs, high business enthusiasm,.. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017 massive regulation cuts, 36 new legislative bills signed, great new S.C.Justice, and Infrastructure, Healthcare and Tax Cuts in works!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017And then he insanely declared that his poll numbers are better than President Obama s.The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That s higher than O s # s!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017As you can see, Trump used a poll taken by Rasmussen, which notoriously leans to the right-wing.
Plus, it s the only poll that shows Trump s approval rating being this high.
All of the others show Trump s approval rating at historic lows.But Trump is not only embarrassing himself by ignoring the other polls, he s wrong about having higher numbers than President Obama.At this time in his presidency on June 18, 2009, Rasmussen took a poll and found that 55 percent of Americans approved of how President Obama was doing his job.That s not even true.
On June 18, 2009, Obama had 55% overall approval, with 35% strong approval.

Or both.Of course, Twitter users mercilessly mocked Trump for it.Dude Rasmussen is a right wing org lol Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) June 18, 2017Rasmussen constantly has the highest approval rating for you.
If you look at other polls your numbers are much lower https://t.co/U01aLAGEub pic.twitter.com/aI6ESllrw3 Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) June 18, 2017Obama typically has 3 to 4 times as many twitter likes for his tweets.
Has about 3 times the followers.
(Even without the fakes) Robert Belcher (@bobbelcher) June 18, 2017Even though that s way higher than the real figure (37%), 50% is still *TERRIBLE* for a recently elected president!
Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) June 18, 2017Every other polls says 35-40%.
Also, since when was Obama s 55% rating lower than 50%.
Can you do math even?
Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) June 18, 2017He s the so called commander in chief that just lost seven sailors, and he s tweeting about ratings instead?
SAD!

Math is hard for the Donald SheBikesLikeABoss (@heather0415) June 18, 2017Rasmussen says more strongly disagree than strongly agree with Trump Chris (@MrMurder37) June 18, 2017pic.twitter.com/VT2cBUqw0z Cody Keenan (@codykeenan) June 18, 2017Featured Image: Pete Souza/White House
