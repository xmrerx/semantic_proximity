With the Democratic primary process drawing to a close soon, and Hillary Clinton likely obtaining the required delegates needed to secure the nomination after June 7, it leaves the question open as to whether or not Bernie Sanders would be open to being vice president.So, while appearing on Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd pressed Sanders on that very issue.
Todd asked: Would you take the call if Hillary Clinton asked you to be her running mate?
Sanders replied: Right now, again, here we are in California, I m knocking my brains out to win the Democratic nomination.
That s where I am right now.
What happens afterwards, you know, we ll see.
But right now, my focus is on winning the nomination.
It s that we ll see that has everyone talking.
It shows that he definitely seems to be entertaining the idea.
However, it s completely understandable that he wouldn t want to definitively say yes, or no for that matter, as the primary contests are still not over, and Sanders, as well as his supporters, would like to see how things turn out first.Would a Clinton/Sanders ticket unite the party that seems to be divided at the moment?
Very likely so, but that doesn t mean it would be something that should happen.
However, no matter what, whoever doesn t get the nomination should find it their new purpose to make sure Donald Trump stays out of the White House.
Because a Trump win wouldn t only be devastating for the nation, but the entire world.
