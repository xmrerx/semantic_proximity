Every once in a while, the perfect pun comes along.
You know them when you see them.
They re so good, you have to come back and use them again and again.
And in situations of discomfort, or fear, or even danger, a pun can be a lifesaver, or an icebreaker, or just something to remind everyone that not everything is serious all the time.Donald Trump presents America with those situations every day.
And although there are plenty of good jokes and puns about his hair or his complexion or the likelihood that he has, um, nether regions that match his abnormally tiny hands, none of those are actually perfect.
They re physical digs, and those are a dime a dozen.No, the funniest jokes about Donald Trump have to do with ironic things he does, like owning a brand of steaks and famously eating them in a way that makes Mr. Creosote himself, well, sick.But the funniest one of them all rolls right off the tongue because it s already a part of our everyday vernacular.
We say Trump s ties to Big Oil, and Trump s ties to Putin s Russia, but really we could just stop at Trump s Ties: They re f*cking hilarious.
And nothing is funnier than taking something that s already funny and making it even better.
So today we re revisiting a Twitter account that popped up back in February specifically for the purpose of making Donald Trump s neckties even funnier than they already are:Here s Trump ruminating over the fact that the Russia investigation had by this time reached the money laundering stage.pic.twitter.com/tF0DpZ2iUP Trump's Ties (@TrumpsTies) August 31, 2017Trump, Pence, and the notoriously filthy Paul Ryan engage in some three-way bondage.pic.twitter.com/L1M6mbO8VU Trump's Ties (@TrumpsTies) September 2, 2017A secret affair between Trump and a top Democrat?

After the social media giant suspended Rose McGowan s account on October 11. a hashtag surfaced called #WomenBoycottTwitter, and @TrumpsTies was among those participating in the blackout:Have a good Friday, friends.
See you on the flip side.
