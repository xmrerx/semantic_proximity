istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey said on sunday that 2,756 people were dismissed from their jobs in public institutions including soldiers , teachers and ministry personnel over links to terror organizations .
the dismissed personnel were found to be members of , or linked to , terror groups , structures and entities that act against national security , according to a decree published in the official gazette .
some 50,000 people have been arrested since a failed putsch in july last year and about 150,000 have been dismissed or suspended from their posts , including soldiers , police , teachers and public servants , over alleged links with the movement of u.s-based cleric fethullah gulen .
the government accused gulen of organizing the attempted coup .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , has denied the accusation and condemned the coup .
rights groups and some western allies fear president tayyip erdogan is using the attempted coup as a pretext to stifle dissent .
the government argues the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt , in which 240 people were killed .
