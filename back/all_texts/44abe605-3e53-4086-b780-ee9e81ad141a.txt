Senator John McCain (R-AZ) was treated at Walter Reed Medical Center over the weekend for a minor tear in his right Achilles tendon, according to his website which further explains that he has returned to work in the Senate and will be wearing a walking boot until his injured tendon is fully healed.
I can t tell you how much I hate wearing this boot!
McCain tweeted.I can't tell you how much I hate wearing this boot!

So, far right-wing sites such as Gateway Pundit, a blog which was gifted with White House credentials (!
), wrote up the breaking news about the boot-switch.Comments poured in the thread under the post, many speculating that McCain is under house arrest and wearing an ankle monitor.
Trump supporters weighed in on Twitter, too.John McCain's walking boot mysteriously appears to swap feet in latest photo-It s official #bootgate is real https://t.co/nC3q3mYK5w Eazy Duz MAGA (@socalmike_SD) November 23, 2017*hypocrite.WHAT A HIPOCRITE!!!

Thank you for your support & best wishes, McCain tweeted.
My left leg was doing extra work to compensate for the boot, so I m giving it a break.
I still hate wearing this boot, but it won t slow us down from frying 7 turkeys today!
