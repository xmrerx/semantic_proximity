Leaving a young child alone in a vehicle is irresponsible especially in Florida during the summer.
So far this year, 16 children have died after being left in a hot car.
Talisha Martin left her child alone in a vehicle for more than 40 minutes while she allegedly went shopping inside a Florida Walmart on Monday.According to a statement from the Palatka Police Department, the store s Loss Prevention Team notified them at about 4:00 p.m. that a 5-year-old child was unattended in a vehicle in the parking lot.
The vehicle was running and the air conditioner was on, but it was blowing hot air something that adds to the heat problem of being abandoned by one s mother in the parking lot of a Walmart during the day in the Florida heat.
The child told officers that he was hot and scared because mommy left me.
When Martin finally arrived, her speech was stuttered and slurred.
She didn t even notice her child was no longer in the car until an officer asked her if something was missing.
The alleged mother was arrested and held on a $500 bond.
The child was released to the custody of her husband, Scott Martin (more on him later).After her release from custody, Martin did what could be expected from a parent who practices such unabashed negligence: she whined about her stupid arrest, blaming it on black people.In her Facebook post, Martin contends that she ran into Walmart to buy toilet paper a run-out that was it (she told a news station she had been exchanging bras).
According to her, she was only in the store for a total of 7 minutes enough time for the car to reach 120 degrees without hot air blowing from the air conditioner, as it was 88 that day.But then a black women (unclear if she means one or multiple) had her nose in business where it didn t belong and went and told Walmart.
This, of course, ruined everything for this obviously responsible parent by calling police.
She says it s pretty damn stupid that they would charge her for child neglect when it could be 10 different charges they could give her.
After all, her child (the one who was scared because mommy left him) asked to stay in the car, she says.She then praises her loving husband (the one to whom the little boy was released), who bonded her out, for his support.
While one might expect the other half of this relationship to give a damn about the child s safety remember that the boy was released to him Scott is very supportive of his wife.
All this is b/s.
My wife wasn t even gone from the house for fifteen minutes and i get a call from the police, he writes in the comment section under the post.
They told me that my son was in the car for OVER AN HOUR!!!!!!!!!
Pardon my language, but that is all f****** b*******!!!!!
I am beyond being mad!!!!!
He then angrily demands that police bust meth labs and other people who are really breaking the law rather than negligent mothers who leave their children unattended in hot vehicles with hot air blowing out of the air conditioner.
It is s*** like this why I am thinking about leaving this f****d up county, and state for that matter & saying f*** all of this s***!!!!!!!!!
he adds.
And if there is anyone who disagrees with what I said, guess what, TOO BAD!
It s called the 1st Amendment, look it up While the Martins might have expected sympathy, they didn t get much from their friends and family.
As some commenters mentioned, the Department of Children and Families will be investigating this matter.
Not only is it illegal for a child to be left in a car, it is also inhumane and potentially deadly, spokesman John Harrell said.
We will do a full and thorough investigation regarding this incident.
Unfortunately, while Martin admits she was wrong and pledges to be a better mother in the future, it is unlikely that she nor her husband have learned anything from this.
Scott Martin, whose Facebook profile indicates that he is former military police, says that ALL THOSE THAT DON T BELIEVE THE TRUTH, AND THINK MY WIFE DONT CARE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, THEN Y ALL CAN JUST GO TO H***.
A few posts below one in which he claims they are loving parents is a share from Conservative Post that advocates hitting your children rather than exercising more reasonable and sane conflict resolution and disciplinary techniques:As for Talisha Martin, she told News4Jax that police and, apparently security footage, are lying about her.
She says she won t do it again but denies that she was in the wrong for blasting hot air on her child in an already hot car: (Police) said that I was in there 40 minutes and that is a lie, Martin said.
Also something about it wasn t even cold air coming out the vent, It was hot air, and that is not true.
I just think it s wrong that I m being blasted out like that when I m a mother and have been a mother for almost ten years.
I clearly won t do it again.
I mean, I don t think I was in the wrong but it is, Martin said.
Something could happen, you know.
They can break the window out.
I mean, stuff could happen, but it was only a few minutes.
Martin has been arrested numerous times since 2011, twice of charges of petit theft and twice for probation violations.It would be nice if they would at least learn from this, but it seems that they are dedicated to just being terrible people.Featured image via Facebook/News4Jax
