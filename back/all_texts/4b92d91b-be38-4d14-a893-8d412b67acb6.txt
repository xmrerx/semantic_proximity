Ted Cruz s presidential campaign has pulled an ad featuring a softcore adult film star.
The ad, titled Conservatives Anonymous, was an attack ad focused on Senator Marco Rubio.
In the production, a support group for conservatives talks about being betrayed by Rubio and his flip-flop on immigration.One of the conservatives in the group is played by actress Amy Lindsay, who tells the group, maybe you should vote for more than just a pretty face next time.
When they were asked about Lindsay, the Cruz campaign apparently panicked.Lindsay has appeared in several softcore porn films, including Erotic Confessions, Carnal Wishes, Secrets of a Chambermaid, and Insatiable Desires.BuzzFeed News, after learning of Lindsay s prior filmography, requested comment from the Cruz campaign.
Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the campaign is taking the ad down and replacing it with a different one.
The actress responded to an open casting call.
She passed her audition and got the job.
Unfortunately, she was not vetted by the production company.
Had the campaign known of her full filmography, we obviously would not have let her appear in the ad, Tyler said.The revelation comes at a bad time for Cruz.
He came in third place in the New Hampshire primary after winning the Iowa caucuses, and hopes to capitalize on social conservative support in order to win the South Carolina primary.Cruz was supported by the right-wing conservative Family Leader, who in the past has called for opposition to pornography which it lumped in with abortion and prostitution as a type of coercion or stolen innocence.
The ad had received praise from conservatives and journalists when it was released on YouTube earlier on Thursday.Now the YouTube page for the ad shows that the video has been removed by the user.
