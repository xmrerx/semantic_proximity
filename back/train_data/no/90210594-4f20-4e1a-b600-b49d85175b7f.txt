beijing ( reuters ) - china understands the spanish government s efforts to protect national unity and opposes any actions to split the country , the chinese foreign ministry said on monday , after the catalan parliament voted to unilaterally declare independence last week .
china generally takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world , while saying it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other nations internal affairs .
on friday , spain s prime minister mariano rajoy assumed direct control of the catalan region , sacked its secessionist government and called a snap election for dec. 21 .
china s position on the issue was clear and consistent , said chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying , reiterating support previously offered to the spanish government .
we think this is an internal affair for spain , and understand and support the spanish government s efforts to protect national and ethnic unity and territorial integrity , and oppose actions to split the country and damage the rule of law , she told a daily news briefing on monday .
we believe that spain has the ability to protect social order and guarantee citizens rights under the framework of the law .
beijing has expressed more openness to independence votes agreed by both sides , such as scotland s unsuccessful 2014 referendum to leave the united kingdom , and south sudan s 2011 vote in favor of independence from sudan .
at home , china contends with what it says are separatist movements in its western regions of tibet and xinjiang , and also claims the self-ruled island of taiwan as a wayward province .
