21st Century Wire says While everyone is busy hyping the North Korean nuclear threat , the one thing that few mainstream media outlets dare to ask about North Korea is: do they actually have an operational nuclear weapons program?Here s your answer: No.To date, there is no evidence at all that Pyongyang has an operational nuclear weapons program, much less a capable or accurate enough ballistic missile program that could deliver such weapons.The Dear Leader: Kim Jung-UnThe usual western sources (media reportage and intelligence sources) claim that North Korea conducted atomic bomb tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 although none of these can be independently verified yet.
So again, the answer, so far has to be no.North Korea also claimed that it tested a hydrogen bomb in January 2016.
Understandably, FOX News loves these Pyongyang propaganda claims as it bolsters the military defense industry global threat talking point, but again, this has not yet been independently verified yet.The fundamental question should be: if Pyongyang has nukes, and no one has actually seen them, including Washington spooks, then why is the media hyping their existence?
The Washington Post admitted as much in 2013, when a former senior Obama administration official admitted there s no actual evidence of any such weapons, saying, We re worried about it, but we haven t seen it .The rest is just expensive guesswork, and US military industrial complex fear mongering.Perhaps the real story is that a divided Korea (between north and south) provides the US with its sole justification for carrying on occupying its many military installations in Japan, the Philippines and numerous other Pacific archipelago installations.In other words it pays for the North Korean nuclear threat to be real.
Understandably, the war hawks and other flamboyant info-tainment personalities will not be happy with this statement made yesterday by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who instead called for diplomacy with Pyongyang RT International reports Washington does not seek regime change in North Korea and at some point would like to have a dialogue with Pyongyang to de-escalate the tensions on the peninsula, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said.
We do not seek a regime change; we do not seek the collapse of the regime; we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula; we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel, Tillerson told reporters Tuesday in Washington DC.Despite repeated warnings from Washington that the US might resort to a military solution to curb Pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs, Tillerson stressed that the US is trying to convey to the North Koreans that we are not your enemy we are not your threat.
But, he said, North Korea continues to present an unacceptable threat to the United States, which forces Washington to respond.
Tillerson however expressed hope that Washington and Pyongyang can resolve their issues through negotiations.
We would like to sit and have a dialogue with them about the future that will give them the security they seek and the future economic prosperity for North Korea, Tillerson said.Secretary Tillerson on #DPRK: United States and China share the same objective, a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
