Donald Trump is dangerous as president.
Anyone who has been watching this trainwreck first in campaign mode, and then during transition, and now during the actual presidency, knows this.
Unfortunately, the Republicans in Washington who are in a position to actually do something seem to be completely ignoring the fact that Trump is completely out of his mind, has shown himself to be a dangerous authoritarian, and, most troubling of all, seems to have some very scary ties to Russia and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin.Well, there is one person on television who isn t going to mince words when it comes to Trump: Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time.
On Friday night, Maher really let Trump have it.
He lit into the disastrous insanity that was Trump s first solo press conference as president, and then went on to blatantly call Trump a nutcase.
He even said that in some ways, Trump is actually WORSE than German dictator Adolf Hitler: You know your Facebook friend who said he thought Trump was Hitler?
He was optimistic.
What we have here is a mental patient who thinks he s Hitler.
The kid in the YouTube video who is high from the dentist made more sense.
Maher then went on to remind his audience not to get distracted by smaller outrages so that we take our eyes off the really dangerous happenings within the Trump White House, and indeed, with Trump himself: While you re watching the clown screw the pony, they re breaking into your car.
At the end of the day, there s just too much goodness and vital truth in this monologue to even begin to do it justice.
All I know is that Bill Maher will be a very important voice when it comes to helping America make it through this presidency with our sanity intact.Watch the brilliant video below:Featured image via video screen capture
