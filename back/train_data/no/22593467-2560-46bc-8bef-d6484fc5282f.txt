washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump said on wednesday that russia was hurting u.s. efforts to rid north korea of nuclear weapons while china had been helpful .
in an interview with fox business network , trump said it would be easier to resolve the north korea nuclear issue if the united states had a better relationship with russia .
china is helping us and maybe russia s going through the other way and hurting what we re getting , trump said of the north korea situation .
a series of weapons tests by north korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between trump and north korean leader kim jong un have ratcheted up tensions .
trump has pressed china to help rein in north korea s nuclear program .
china , north korea s sole major ally , accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country .

u.s.-russia relations have been strained over allegations russia meddled in the 2016 u.s. presidential election , moscow s annexation of crimea from ukraine and its backing of the syrian government .
i think we could have a good relationship with russia , trump said .
i think that north korean situation would be easier settled .
