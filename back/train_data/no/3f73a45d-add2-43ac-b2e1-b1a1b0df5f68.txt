washington ( reuters ) - u.s. presidential candidate democrat bernie sanders voted on tuesday in favor of a bill that would require audits of federal reserve monetary policy decisions , his campaign said in a statement following the vote .
sanders said he supports the bill because too much of the u.s. central bank ’ s business is conducted in secret .
“ requiring the government accountability office to conduct a full and independent audit of the fed each and every year , would be an important step towards making the federal reserve a more democratic institution that is responsive to the needs of ordinary americans rather than the billionaires on wall street , ” sanders said in the statement .
