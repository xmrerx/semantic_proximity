my name is joe dan gorman , and you can blame me for intellectual froglegs .
i created it , i write & produce it and i host it .
so , it s pretty much my fault.in case you haven t seen it yet the basis of froglegs is to be covertly educational with humor , wicked cool graphics and classic tunage.and we re not following the media narrative or chasing the media-driven outrage of the day - but we will talk about things that matter , from the historical to the hysterical.i have no allegiance to a political party my allegience is to god , truth and freedom .
oh , and funny stuff .
lolthe best part i get to ridicule liberals , atheists and other assorted anti-american jackasses .
how fun.the most flattering compliment i get is when someone asks me to thank my staff but as far as the writing , editing , researching and production of the show i m it .
i also do all the website work.i ll steal jokes like a democrat , lol now there is nothing more important than god , so i invite you to enjoy some of the cool videos ay my god , science & history page .
nobody quite articulates the incomprehensibly massive power of god like a physicist .
god of wonders is one of my favorites.you can help joe dan who runs an ad-free website by donating here : donate button look for regular installments of joe dan gorman s videos on our website .
we found his videos by chance and have fallen in love with his honest and ball-crushing humor .
we feel blessed to call him our buddy and hope you will find him as refreshing and hysterical as we do.enjoy !
