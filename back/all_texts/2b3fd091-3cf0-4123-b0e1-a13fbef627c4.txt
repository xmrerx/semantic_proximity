There are many who want to claim that Climate Change is a hoax.
They are usually the people spending an insane amount of money to pretend that fossil fuels have no impact on our environment, the politicians receiving the money, as well as the people who are easily convinced by this paid trickery campaign.Then there are those who are grounded in the reality that Climate Change not only exists, but it is one of if not the most existential threats to not only the world, but humankind.We ve seen photos of receding ice and polar bears stuck on icebergs, but the reality of Climate Change has never been so real as when you look at what it is actually doing to the wildlife in the Arctic.Photographer Sebastian Copeland captured an image that is as important to see as it is heartbreaking to witness.
Here, you ll see a young polar bear who literally starved to death, because according to Copeland, it just didn t have the food it needed to survive due to retreating ice.
Thus, the food the bears need, which is necessary for survival, is in short supply and/or difficult to find.Photo by Sebastian Copeland via Huffington PostCopeland s latest book explains: For the state of the ice in general, we re headed into uncharted territory.
There s no doubt about it The faster retreat of the sea ice, a bear s favoured spot for seal hunting, leads to longer fasting periods and the demise of more animals from starvation.
And the more we ignore the fact that Climate Change exists, the more pictures like this are going to be appearing, because the threat is becoming worse and worse as the years go on.It s not only important that we elect people into office that recognize the impact of Climate Change, but it is imperative to our existence on this planet.
We can t stand idly by while our world dies around us, because sooner or later, we re gonna be next.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons
