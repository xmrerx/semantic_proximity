Unlike our racist, anti-American President, this brilliant Louisiana State Senator, Elbert Lee Guillory is color blind.
He is not however, blind to Obama and his radical agenda.
His comments represent what so many Americans believe about Obama and the liberal Democrat party.
His plea for Obama to stop leaving America vulnerable to terrorists and nations who hate us is heartbreaking History will remember you, Mr. President as a weakling.
From his Facebook page: Today America is at war with ISIS.
They attack our soldiers, our homeland and our friends.
When our law abiding citizens need to protect our streets and communities most, President Obama chooses this same moment to limit OUR gun rights.
This is my response to his unbelievable position.
