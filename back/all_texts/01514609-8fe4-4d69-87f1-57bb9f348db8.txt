The new, ridiculous anti-LGBT law that Mississippi just passed and signed into law is not only discriminatory, but the opposite of freedom despite being labeled a religious freedom law.
The only freedom it grants is for religious zealots to legally discriminate and fire people for being gay, as well as turn them away from their businesses, very reminiscent of Jim Crow era laws.Knowing how horrific these sort of laws are, and being on the receiving end of being fired for being gay, Ellen DeGeneres took a moment on her show to talk about the new Mississippi law.
She said she s not a political person, but stated when I see something wrong, I have to talk about it, so she did.Ellen said of the law: It s the very definition of discrimination.
It s also something that the Supreme Court already ruled on when they made marriage a right for everyone, everyone.
Then jokingly added: They re Supreme.
I mean, that s the best you can get.
Like the Nacho Supreme from Taco Bell.
However, she took a very serious tone talking about her own experiences being discriminated against, but coming out on top in the end.
If you re in Mississippi or North Carolina or anywhere and you re saddened by the fact that people are judging you based on who you love, don t lose hope.
I was fired for being gay, and I know what it feels like.
I lost everything.
But look at me now.
The crowd then erupts into cheers, with Ellen perfectly adding: I could buy that governor s mansion, flip it, and make a $7 million dollar profit.
But really driving home the point that what we really, truly need in this world is less hate and more love.
And she couldn t be more right.Thank you, Ellen.
You re spot-on as usual, and hopefully Mississippi takes notice.Watch the segment here: Featured image via video screen capture
