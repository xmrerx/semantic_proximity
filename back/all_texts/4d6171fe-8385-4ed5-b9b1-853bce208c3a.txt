If Donald Trump picked retired General David Petraeus as the next Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, it would be his worst hypocrisy to date.For months, Trump attacked Hillary Clinton relentlessly for keeping a private email server as Secretary of States, accusing her of exposing classified information even though the FBI cleared her of any such wrongdoing.You know who the FBI didn t clear of such wrongdoing?
David Petraeus.And that s why Trump would be a hypocrite if he actually offered him either significant government posts.
But he is doing exactly that.Back in 2012, Petraeus infamously resigned as Director of the CIA after it was revealed that he had been engaged in an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, whom he gave access to eight Black Books filled with highly classified information, which included the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussions, and discussions he had with President Obama.It was such a terrible breach in national security that the Justice Department wanted to prosecute him for committing a felony, and would have if Petraeus had not agreed to a plea deal in 2015.So while Hillary Clinton was doing nothing different from what other Secretaries of State have done, it s pretty clear that what Petraeus did makes him the real threat to national security.And it s unclear if he could even get the security clearance necessary for a Secretary of State or Defense to have in order to do the job.
After all, Trump said of Clinton in September that, If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn t even get a security clearance.
Obviously, Trump could always pull strings and we already know that Republicans in Congress are hypocrites who can be easily bought.
But picking Petraeus for either one of these top jobs would demonstrate that he is a hypocrite who doesn t give a damn about national security and that he has a double standard.By picking Petraeus, Trump would also be admitting once again that he lied to his supporters.
Trump has been stringing them along for months getting them to chant Lock her up every time he calls Hillary Clinton a criminal.
But if anybody should be locked up, it s Petraeus.
He literally shared highly classified information that could have put people and the country at risk.
But Trump is considering him anyway and that is infuriating.Featured Image: Wikimedia
