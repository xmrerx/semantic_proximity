The GOP has long been a place that only held the interests of white men but no Republican has ever had the guts to admit this until now.
Yesterday, Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin the candidate that many conservatives hoped would have beaten Donald Trump sent out a series of tweets blatantly exposing the racism that exists within the Republican Party.In his revealing tweetstorm, McMullin condemned conservatives like Carl Paladino, who had recently made these offensive comments about First Lady Michelle Obama: I d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortable in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla, Paladino said.Twitter McMullin also stated that many Republicans were aware that there is a racism issue in the GOP, but they are up against a majority of conservatives who are too invested in their white privilege to explore a better way forward.TwitterTwitter McMullin also made sure to throw Trump under the bus for his racist, divisive rhetoric as he has had a major role in how racism played out in our country over the last year.Twitter McMullin s tweets were surely going to infuriate most Republicans who insist that America is post-racial instead of addressing their ignorance, but he also made someone else angry.
Former KKK leader and avid Trump supporter David Duke was among the first to respond to McMullin and bash him for being so transparent:Twitter And of course, McMullin s response couldn t have been more perfect: Racism within the Republican Party has been a massive issue, and some GOPers have made lesser attempts to point this out.
Years ago, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham said, We re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.
And yet, the GOP has still ignored the fact that racism exists and continues to promote platforms that exclude minority voters.
Hopefully, McMullin s brutal honesty will encourage the Republican Party to take a good hard look at itself.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images
