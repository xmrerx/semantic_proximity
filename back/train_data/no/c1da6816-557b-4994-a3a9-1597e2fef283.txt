we may not agree with most of what rapper azalea banks has to say , but she is a fierce defender of free speech and as such , has come out with a flurry of in-your-face tweets to the black , typically democrat voters , announcing her supporting donald trump .
donald trump can add another member of hollywood to his list of supporters.azalea banks offered her support for donald trump in a series of tweets that started out with , i really want donald trump to win the election .
she went on to say trump just wants the u.s. to be lavish for all of us .
her tweet seems to suggest that trump wants everyone to have the opportunity to prosper in america .
she followed it up by saying , hillary talks to black people as if we re children or pets .
i can t stand herrrrr .
when her followers called her out , suggesting trump was a racist and symbol of hatred , banks replied : banks defends her right to her opinion against angry twitter followers over her endorsement of trump : it wasn t that long ago azealia banks called for the gang rape of sarah palin .
we re not so sure her endorsement is one that donald trump will embrace .
