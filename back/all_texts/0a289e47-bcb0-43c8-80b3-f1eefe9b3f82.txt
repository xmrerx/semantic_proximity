In the Post-ABC poll released on Friday, Clinton led Trump by 47 percent to 44 percent.
Clinton had an advantage in affirmative support, the poll said, with 55 percent of backers saying they are mainly supporting her, compared with 43 percent of Trump voters.
More Trump voters say they “mainly oppose Clinton.”
