samarkand , uzbekistan ( reuters ) - lola karimova-tillyaeva , the second daughter of uzbek president islam karimov who died last year , will step down soon as uzbekistan s representative at unesco , she said on monday .
karimova-tillyaeva , 39 , said she would focus on helping run a charitable foundation named after her father who died last september after running the ex-soviet central asian state with an iron fist for 27 years .
in the near future , i plan to step down from my role as ambassador in order to focus on my family , personal goals , ( and ) projects being implemented by the islam karimov foundation as well as other creative , charitable and cultural projects , karimova-tillyaeva said at a conference on uzbekistan s islamic cultural and scientific heritage .
her once powerful elder sister , gulnara karimova , fell out with their father around 2014 , and since his death karimova-tillyaeva has been his only close relative holding a prominent government post .
gulnara karimova was sentenced in 2015 to five years probation - a measure which may equal house arrest in uzbek law - for acquiring through extortion or embezzlement stakes in a number of companies , and for tax evasion .
she is also being investigated on charges of fraud , evading customs and foreign exchange regulations , and money laundering .
karimova-tillyaeva , who is married to uzbek businessman timur tillyaev , has said she was estranged from her sister for years .
it was unclear from her speech on monday whether she planned to move back to uzbekistan after leaving the post of ambassador at the paris-based u.n. agency .
