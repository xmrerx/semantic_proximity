Just another day in the holy month of Ramadan London is the scene of carnage again with another terror attack.
A van plowed into pedestrians on London Bridge with reports of men jumping out of the van to stab random people.
We re posting details as they come in from the UK.
The Muslim Mayor of London is too busy criticizing President Trump for taking measures to ensure the United States is not subjected to never-ending acts of terrorism to actually identify and work to solve the radical Muslim issue that is exploding in the UK.Meanwhile, President Trump has offered the help of the United States to the citizens of London and of the UK:Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there WE ARE WITH YOU.
GOD BLESS!
