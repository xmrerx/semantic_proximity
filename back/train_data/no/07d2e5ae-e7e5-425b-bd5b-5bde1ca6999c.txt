my desire to be in the cabinet was great but it wasn t that great and he had a lot of terrific candidates and i thought i could play a better role being on the outside and continuing to be his close friend and adviser , giuliani told fox news neil cavuto.trump met with giuliani on nov. 29. , when the matter was discussed .
he confirmed to fox news that he had only been interested in being secretary of state .
honestly , the other positions i didn t have an interest in , so that really was the only one i had any real interest in , he told cavuto.giuliani said he now intends to continue his work in the private sector .
he also warned against the selection of mitt romney for the position , saying the former massachusets governor had gone over the line in previous criticisms he made about trump .
i will support [ trump s ] decision , but my advice would be that mitt went a little too far .
you can make friends and make up but i would not see him as a candidate for the cabinet , giuliani told cavuto.trump praised giuliani in a statement , calling him an extraordinarily talented and patriotic american .
