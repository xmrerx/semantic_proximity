istanbul ( reuters ) - president tayyip erdogan said turkey may shut its border with northern iraq at any moment after closing its air space to the region , hurriyet newspaper reported on thursday , reviving a threat first made after kurds there voted for independence .
we have completely closed our air space to the regional government in northern iraq , the paper cited erdogan as telling reporters on his plane returning from a trip to poland .
talks are continuing on what will be done regarding the land ( border ) ... we have not shut the border gates yet but this could happen too at any moment , he added .
turkey announced on monday it was closing its air space to the semi-autonomous kurdish region and said it would work to hand control of the main border crossing into the region to the central iraqi government .
the habur gate is the main transit point between turkey and iraq s semi-autonomous kurdish regional government .
a sept. 25 referendum , in which kurds in northern iraq voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence , alarmed baghdad , iraq s neighbors and western powers , all of whom feared further regional conflict could arise from the vote .
subsequently kurdish peshmerga forces retreated to positions they held in northern iraq in june 2014 in response to an iraqi army advance into the region after the referendum , a senior iraqi commander said on wednesday .
ankara , which has been battling a three-decade insurgency in its own mainly kurdish southeast , fears an independent kurdish state on its borders would heighten separatist tension at home .
