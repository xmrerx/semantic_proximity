Trump may be working to silence government agencies like the Department of the Interior, home to the National Park Service, as well as the EPA and the USDA s science and research office, but some government employees are not having it.
Operating anonymously, a group of rangers from the National Park Service, with the help of some friends, are running a Twitter account that s going after Trump s efforts to muzzle science.The name on the account is AltUSNatParkService.
They ve been around since 2015, but only became well known over the last day or so as Trump worked to remove scientific information from the White House website, and seems to be ordering any agency or department that publishes climate science to shut it.In addition to posting photos from our beautiful national parks, these rangers have also launched a very obvious offensive effort against Herr Trump by being a veritable fount of climate science.These are people who will not be silenced.These are people who will not allow their colleagues to be silenced either.And besides the climate science they re tweeting, they re also taking very pointed digs at Trump.
Take a look below:Hello, we are the Alternative National Park Service Twitter Account activated in time of war and censorship to ensure fact-based education.

AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Mr Trump, you may have taken us down officially.
But with scientific evidence & the Internet our message will get out.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 24, 2017Respect goes out to our brothers and sisters at the @BadlandsNPS.
When they silence you, we will speak for you.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 24, 2017Think about what happened for employees at #BadlandsNationalPark to actually DELETE factual tweets on climate change.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 24, 2017The US president has silenced national parks & environmental agencies from reporting climate change & #BeerCanAppreciationDay is trending!
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017There $ a rea$on WHY Pre$ident Trump want$ u$ $ilenced on #Climate $cience.
Don t let US institutions be cen$ored AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Tonight Trump gagged National Park Services & signed executive order to restart Dakota Access & Keystone XL pipelines.
#climate AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Shoutout to the anonymous crews at .
@BadIandsNPS continuing the great work of the original before Trump s (tiny) hand came down.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017The Badlands were created over eons through the gradual erosion of sediment.
The erosion of U.S. democracy, however, will be far more rapid.
BadlandsNPS (@BadIandsNPS) January 25, 2017We don t want any trouble.
We just want to keep peer-reviewed factually accurate climate science flowing out of US institutions.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Did no one tell President Trump about the Streisand Effect?
You silence our colleagues officially, and we will scream when we get home.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017We re fighting for our right to live, to exist.To have peer-reviewed science be published by our institutions.
#climate #ResistTrump AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017And should we win the day, the 24th Jan will no longer be known as an American day, but as the day when the world declared in one voice AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017 We will not go quietly into the night!We will not vanish without a fight!We re going to live on!We ll fight climate change denial pic.twitter.com/HWNhAKmaBz AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017To understand what s best for our parks, we need to have access to US science data on climate & the environment.
We must not be silenced.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Then they explain what has happened:Want some real fact to go with your alt-president?
US national parks posted tweets about climate change that were later deleted.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017The National Park Service shut its own Twitter operation briefly on Friday after an apparent clampdown.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017The park service had retweeted photos about turnout at President Donald Trump s inauguration.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017But the accounts were reactivated the next day after an apology for mistaken retweets.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Since then the park service tweets have been about park news and scenery.
South Dakota park then posted tweets about climate science data.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017President Trump has called climate change a hoax & the White House deleted the climate change policies on its website on inauguration day.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017A media blackout has also been introduced over our colleagues at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Fun fact: The White House is surrounded by NPS land, and during Occupy they supported the protesters despite the mayor s objection.
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Can t wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS.You can take our official twitter, but you ll never take our free time!
AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017They re also actively supporting a Scientists March on Washington to show this administration that science will not go down without a fight any more than women, people of color, LGBTQ people and anyone else marginalized will.Perhaps the sudden popularity of this account will give employees of other muzzled agencies some ideas for how to keep their information flowing.
In the age of social media, it s far more difficult to silence people.
