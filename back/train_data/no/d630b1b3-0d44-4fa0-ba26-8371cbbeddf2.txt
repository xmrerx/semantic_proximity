london ( reuters ) - britain s main opposition labour party said on tuesday it could not vote for the government s legislation to sever ties with the european union unless it was amended to prevent ministers from grabbing powers from parliament .
parliament will begin debating the eu withdrawal bill on thursday and there will be a vote on monday , testing prime minister theresa may s deal to shore up her majority with the support of a small northern irish party .
labour fully respects the democratic decision to leave the european union ... and backs a jobs-first brexit with full tariff-free access to the european single market , labour said in a statement .
but as democrats we can not vote for a bill that unamended would let government ministers grab powers from parliament to slash people s rights at work and reduce protection for consumers and the environment .
