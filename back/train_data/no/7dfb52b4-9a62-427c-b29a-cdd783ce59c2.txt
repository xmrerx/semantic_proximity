washington ( reuters ) - u.s. defense secretary ash carter is scheduled to preview the pentagon ’ s fiscal 2017 budget request in a speech on feb. 2 , a week before the white house sends its budget plans to congress , two u.s. defense officials said on monday .
carter is expected to highlight the broad themes of the pentagon ’ s budget request and its priorities , rather than presenting a detailed list of programmatic changes , said one of the sources , who was not authorized to speak publicly .
a massive government spending bill enacted by congress last year set a spending level of about $ 576 billion for the pentagon in fiscal 2017 , which meant the defense department had to trim its planned funding levels by about $ 15 billion .
the white house earlier this month said it plans to release president barack obama ’ s budget proposal for fiscal year 2017 , which begins on oct. 1 , on feb. 9 .
lockheed martin corp ( lmt.n ) , maker of the f-35 fighter jet , boeing co ( ba.n ) and other big weapons makers are anxiously awaiting details about the budget and how it will affect their programs .
senior defense officials have said that the $ 15 billion in cuts would largely come from procurement accounts since personnel costs and operations costs were harder to cut .
defense undersecretary frank kendall , the military ’ s chief weapons buyer , told reporters last month that the pentagon ’ s fiscal 2017 budget plan may slow production of key weapons programs , including the f-35 fighter jet .
