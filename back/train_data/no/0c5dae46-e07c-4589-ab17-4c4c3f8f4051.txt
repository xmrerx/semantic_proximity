all you have to do is listen to clapper lie before congress and you know he has zero credibility to speak : remember the famous moment when us national intelligence chief james clapper was testifying about the nsa surveillance of americans when he let slip a sign he was not being truthful .
of course , we knew this was all a smoke and mirrors show .
clapper later said he misspoke last we checked it s pretty much the same thing as lying not wittingly james clapperhere s the video below where he parses words in his testimony : clapper took over in 2010 heading up 17 different intelligence agencies .
his tenure was marked by the edward snowden leaks on us intelligence .
he s always said he d resign at the end of obama s presidency but we re wondering if he s jumping before trump appointees arrive .
clapper and gen. mike flynn have a history that s not so perfect : two years ago , i was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence , and after some niceties , i was told by the usdi that i was being let go from dia .
it was definitely an uncomfortable moment ( i suspect more for them than me ) .i asked the dni ( gen. james clapper ) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not ; had it been , he said , they would have relieved me on the spot.i knew then it had more to do with the stand i took on radical islamism and the expansion of al qaeda and its associated movements .
i felt the intel system was way too politicized , especially in the defense department .
after being fired , i left the meeting thinking , here we are in the middle of a war , i had a significant amount of combat experience ( nearly five years ) against this determined enemy on the battlefield and served at senior levels , and here it was , the bureaucracy was letting me go .
amazing.this ll be interesting to watch .
