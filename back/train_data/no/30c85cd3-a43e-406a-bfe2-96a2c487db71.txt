berlin ( reuters ) - more than 1,500 police will be on duty in berlin on sunday , when germany s capital faces the logistical challenge of organising an election expected to draw a large turnout - while ensuring its annual marathon also runs smoothly .
police , election officials and race organisers have been in close consultations about security arrangements , especially following a deadly truck rampage on a berlin christmas market last december as well as an attack on the boston marathon in 2013 .
officials with the berlin police and the bka federal criminal police office said they had no indications of any specific plots to attack either the race or the city s 1,779 polling stations .
berlin s state election office said letters had been sent to around 44,000 of the city s 2.5 million eligible voters warning that some 30 stations might be difficult to reach because of the marathon .
the marathon is expected to end in early afternoon , while polls close at 6 p.m. local time .
voter participation is expected to exceed the 72.5 percent of 2013 largely due to a referendum about the fate of berlin s tegel airport that served the city through the cold war .
voter participation was already relatively high in 2013 , but we think it will be even higher this year because of high interest in the tegel referendum , a spokesman said .
