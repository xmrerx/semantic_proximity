mogadishu ( reuters ) - more than 500 people were killed in twin bomb blasts in mogadishu in october , a somali committee looking into the attack said on thursday , raising the death toll from at least 358 .
in the incidents on oct. 14 , a truck bomb exploded outside a busy hotel at the k5 intersection lined with government offices , restaurants and kiosks .
a second blast struck medina district two hours later .
the impact of the truck bomb was worsened by it exploding next to a fuel tanker that increased its intensity and left many bodies being burnt or mutilated beyond recognition .
by oct. 20 , the government said the toll had reached 358 .
it set up a committee , known as the zobe rescue committee , to establish a more accurate death toll by talking to relatives of those who may have been at the site of the blasts .
so far we have confirmed 512 people died in last month s explosion ... ( some ) 316 others were also injured in that blast , abdullahi mohamed shirwac , the committee s chairman , told reuters on thursday .
there was no immediate comment from the government on the latest toll .
the bomb attacks were the deadliest since islamist militant group al shabaab began an insurgency in 2007 .
al shabaab has not claimed responsibility , but the method and type of attack - a large truck bomb - is increasingly used by the al qaeda-linked organization .
al shabaab stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country .
although the group says it targets the government and security forces , it has detonated large bombs in crowded public areas before .
it has sometimes not claimed responsibility for bombings that provoked a big public backlash , such as the 2009 suicide bombing of a graduation ceremony for medical students .
