Obama s unconstitutional government overreach was allowed to run rampant in DC for way too long.
There s a new sheriff in town and under that new sheriff s leadership is a newly emboldened Congress who miraculously just found their spine Congressional lawmakers will review a final rule issued by President Obama in December that stomps on the Second Amendment rights of Social Security beneficiaries.According to the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, Obama s Social Security rule qualifies SSI and disability insurance recipients as mental defectives, and therefore incapable of legally owning firearms.The rule allows those affected to file a petition for restoration of their Second Amendment rights, yet tens of thousands of legal gun owners must now prove their possession of firearms would not harm public safety or the public interest, even though the government never established, or tried to establish, the contrary, NRA-ILA added.NRA-IRA executive director Chris Cox praised Congress decision in a Wednesday statement.
Congress s decision to review the Obama administration s back-door gun grab is a significant step forward in restoring the fundamental constitutional rights of many law-abiding gun owners, he wrote.
The NRA has been fighting this unconstitutional government overreach since it was first discussed and we look forward to swift congressional action to overturn it.
