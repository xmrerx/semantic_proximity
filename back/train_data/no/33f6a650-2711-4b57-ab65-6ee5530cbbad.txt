new york ( reuters ) - the cost to healthcare companies for u.s. regulatory review of their products , including drugs and medical devices , would more than double under the trump administration ’ s proposed 2018 budget .
for 2018 , the trump administration has budgeted over $ 2 billion in fees to be collected by the u.s. food and drug administration from industry , twice as much as in 2017 , according to budget documents released on thursday .
citing a constrained budget environment , the proposed budget said industries that benefit from the fda ’ s approval “ can and should pay for their share. ” in return , the budget said it also offered measures that would help speed up the approval process for new drugs and other products .
the fda has been criticized by lawmakers for not being quick enough at approving drugs , and president donald trump told congress earlier this year that he aimed to speed up the approval of drugs .
the fda has been charging companies to review their products since 1992 .
most of the user fees collected are for prescription drugs - around $ 866 million estimated in 2017 - and generic drugs - around $ 324 million , according to the fda website .
the fda ’ s 2017 budget was $ 5.1 billion , the website said .
the budget does not say if the fee increases would be evenly spread or directed in a particular area .
the budget did not provide specifics on what measures to speed up approvals might include .
