Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Friday said the terror threat is worse than most realize, saying some people would never leave the house if they knew the truth.
I was telling Steve Doocy on the way in here, if he knew what I knew about terrorism, he d never leave the house in the morning, Kelly said on Fox & Friends.
He noted there were four major terror attacks in the last week in England, Egypt, the Philippines and Indonesia by generally the same groups.
It s everywhere.
It s constant.
It s nonstop.
The good news for us in America is we have amazing people protecting us every day.
But it can happen here almost anytime.

Kelly: If you knew what I do about terrorism, you d never leave the house, but we do have the finest people protecting us.
