a successful business man has launched a political campaign against paul ryan .
we love what he s doing even though it s unconventional .
paul nehlen put up billboards this week that are devastating to the republican speaker : following last night s historic brexit vote , house speaker paul ryan s primary challenger , wisconsin businessman paul nehlen , seems to have taken a page from the playbook of the u.k .
independence party ( ukip ) with the launch of a new billboard campaign.on friday morning , nehlen s campaign went live with a new billboard in ryan s hometown of janesville , wisconsin that is reminiscent of the distinctive ukip-style campaign.the ad reads : radical islam kills americans .
vote yes for immigration control .
vote no for paul ryan .
the billboard then directs viewers to nehlen s campaign website , electnehlen.com.ukip s national billboard campaign is distinctive for its clear , straight-forward manner of describing the effects of large-scale migration and its impact on workers and western culture .
