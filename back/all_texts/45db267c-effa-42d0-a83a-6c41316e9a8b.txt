Meryl Streep has certainly proven herself capable of playing any role, regardless of whether the character is a woman or a man, but her latest performance is a little bit different from what she usually does.Streep s latest use of her talents include a costume of ridiculous blonde hair, a fat suit and some horribly-applied orange self-tanner in other words, she s become Donald Trump!
At the annual Shakespeare in the Park Public Theater Gala on Monday, the award-winning actress impersonated The Donald as she performed onstage with fellow actress Christine Baranski, who was performing as Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton.
The two actresses delighted the audience as they sang a parody version of Cole Porter s song Brush Up Your Shakespeare, a number from the musical Kiss Me Kate all while keeping in character.Zeroing in on Trump s misogynistic nature, Streep imitated Trump and showed everyone why she s been routinely called the best actress of her generation.
During the skit, she bellowed: You ll let me know why it is all the women say no.
Baranski replied: Brush up your Shakespeare and the women you will wow.
Just declaim a few lines from Othello, and they ll think you re a hell of a fella.
The skit was hilarious, and fans were quick to pull out their phones and start taping the show.
Here s a clip and some tweets to show just how much everyone loved it:More of Meryl and Christine Baranski doing Trump and HRC pic.twitter.com/t7jgNsf74d Jacob Bernstein (@BernsteinJacob) June 7, 2016TwitterTwitterStreep s mockery of The Donald makes all the sense in the world, considering that she s been a strong supporter of Clinton.
To make this performance even more epic, it just happened to fall on the same evening that the real Hillary Clinton made history by becoming the first woman to clinch the presidential nomination of a major political party.
There s no better way to celebrate that than by bashing Donald Trump.Featured image via Twitter
