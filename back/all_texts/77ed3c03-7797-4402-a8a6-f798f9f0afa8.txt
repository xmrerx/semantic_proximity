Last week, RABA Research had Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in a general election match-up by 15 points, gaining 10 points on the GOP presidential candidate after a strong showing at the Democratic National Convention.RABA s poll was considered a complete outlier, given most other polls (whether they be from Reuters, CNN, Fox, Ipsos) had Clinton beating Trump by 6 to 10 points.But now a second poll has come out that may put RABA back into the mainstream.A McClatchy-Marist poll has given Hillary Clinton a 15 point lead over Donald Trump (48-33), and a 14 point lead when factoring in third party candidates (45-31).
So even with spoilers, Clinton blows Trump out of the water.What s even more fascinating is the McClatchy-Marist poll shows Clinton with an 8 point lead among men, and a 23 point lead among those who identify as moderates.
Clinton is also viewed as more presidential than Trump by 14 points (53-39).When it comes to who can best handle the War on Terror, immigration, gun violence, trade and jobs, Clinton bests Trump in EVERY category, by a margin of 4-21 points.While Clinton gained in Democratic support, going from 83 percent to 90 percent, Trump lost among Republicans, going from 85 percent to 79 percent.So Jill Stein isn t siphoning off Clinton supporters, but it would appear Gary Johnson may be gaining with Trump supporters.
I guess those in the Never Trump camp are aplenty while those in the Never Hillary are almost non-existent.Wasn t Trump supposed to be the great unifier?
He s losing members of his own party, and quickly (remember, the RNC was only two weeks ago).In fact, 57 percent of people voting for Clinton are voting for her, more or less, because of her, whereas 40 percent are doing it to spite Trump.
On the other side, only 36 percent of Trump supporters are voting for the billionaire because they like him, while 57 are voting for him to spite Clinton.So Trump s voters don t really like him all that much.
Clinton s voters?
They sure do.This poll is not an outlier.
It s the second one showing Secretary Clinton with a monumental lead.
As Trump continues into the abyss, Clinton is truly making the sky her limit.This will only pay off if Democrats and progressives alike get out and vote.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
