beirut ( reuters ) - the u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , a leading combatant against islamic state , on thursday accused turkey of pressuring one of its senior commanders into defecting .
rebel officials said on wednesday brigadier general talal silo had defected , without giving a reason .
it would be the first such departure from the sdf s top ranks .
there was no comment from turkey , which backs syrian rebel factions and views the sdf , spearheaded by the kurdish ypg militia , as a security threat .
silo served as a spokesman for the sdf , an alliance of mostly kurdish and arab militias battling islamic state in syria with the help of the u.s.-led coalition .
the sdf said in a statement they had lost contact with silo , who had resigned from his post .
general talal silo was respected and appreciated among our ranks , it said .
he was subjected to a lot of pressure and extortion from the side of the turkish state , that amounted at some points to threatening his sons who are in turkey .
we believe his disappearance is the result of a special operation by turkish intelligence in collusion with some of his family members .
kurdish fighters , alongside arab allies , u.s. advisers and coalition air strikes , have driven islamic state from swathes of territory including its former headquarters in raqqa city .
the ypg and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north , and now control nearly a quarter of syria .
their influence angers neighboring turkey , which considers the ypg an extension of the banned kurdistan workers party , which has fought a decades-long insurgency on turkish soil .
the u.s.-led coalition had said it was aware of reports of talal silo s apparent departure from the sdf , but have no further details on his current status at this time .
our forces will not be affected by this incident , and we will inform the public of the results of our investigation , the sdf said on thursday .
