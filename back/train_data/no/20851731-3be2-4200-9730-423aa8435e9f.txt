astana ( reuters ) - the international atomic energy agency , the u.n. global nuclear watchdog , opened a uranium bank in kazakhstan on tuesday , a $ 150-million facility designed to discourage new nations from enriching the nuclear fuel .
the low enriched uranium ( leu ) bank in the city of oskemen , in eastern kazakhstan , will store up to 90 tonnes of the fuel , enough to power a large city for three years , and sell it to iaea members if they are unable to procure it elsewhere .
the leu bank will serve as a last-resort mechanism to provide confidence to countries that they will be able to obtain leu for the manufacture of fuel for nuclear power plants in the event of an unforeseen , non-commercial disruption to their supplies , iaea director general yukiya amano said in a statement on monday .
countries such as iran have said they need enrichment facilities to ensure a steady supply of fuel for nuclear power plants , and the idea behind the bank is to make such supply available without domestic enrichment .
russia has operated a similar bank since 2010 but the one in kazakhstan will be the first one fully owned and operated by the global nuclear watchdog .
by hosting the iaea leu bank , kazakhstan has made another contribution to strengthening the global non-proliferation regime , kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said as he handed amano a symbolical key to the facility at a ceremony in the kazakh capital , astana .
i am confident that the iaea leu bank will make a valuable contribution to international efforts to ensure the availability of fuel for nuclear power plants , amano said .
the iaea said in a statement it would begin buying uranium soon , with the aim to ship it to the bank next year .
the project was funded by donors , including the united states , the european union , kuwait , the united arab emirates , norway and the nuclear threat initiative .
