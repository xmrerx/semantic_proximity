It can be said that Donald Trump was less than pleased that he came in second to Ted Cruz in the Iowa Caucus.
However, that s putting it mildly.
From his expressionless concession speech, to his next day blame game, to his temper tantrum against Cruz, he s been pretty much a loose cannon.Although, leave it to Jimmy Fallon to show Trump s true reaction to coming in second place that likely happened in a dream on Trump s flight from Iowa to New Hampshire.
On Wednesday s edition of the Tonight Show, Fallon donned the infamous Trump wig and did his spot-on impersonation once again to have Trump declare he s the winner and champion of second place.
He then tells everyone, In case you re wondering, the J stands for genius.
Then after declaring victory, he says: It s just like children say: First is the worst, second is the best, third is the one with the hairy chest .
Marco Rubio get that taken care of.
I wouldn t want your hair to make you look ridiculous.
Fallon then goes through how many wonderful things in life have the number two in them or come in twos, thus making him equally as spectacular.
Of course.He ends by telling everyone: From now on, when you think Donald Trump, I want you to think YUGE No.
2 So watch out New Hampshire, because the deuce is loose.
And it s true, Trump often does appear to be a giant piece of sh*t more often than not, so it fits.It will definitely be interesting to see what happens in New Hampshire after their primary vote next week.
Will Trump still be the champion of second place?
Or will he be able to finally declare a true victory?
We ll just have to wait and see.
