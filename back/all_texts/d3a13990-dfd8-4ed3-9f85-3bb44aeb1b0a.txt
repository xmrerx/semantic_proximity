It s no secret that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is spineless that s a reputation he s earned for himself throughout his entire career.
But thanks to an audio clip from October 2016 that has just resurfaced, everyone is now being reminded how unreliable and weak Ryan truly is when it comes to holding to his beliefs.Coming at a time when Ryan is receiving tons of negative criticism due to his celebration that the CBO report on the American Health Care Act is going to cost millions of Americans to lose their health insurance, this looks pretty bad for the House Speaker.
The footage from October 2016 was posted by none other than Breitbart, and it shows Ryan distancing himself from Trump after the corrupt businessman s misogynistic comments on the infamous Access Hollywood footage.
Ryan can be heard saying: I am not going to defend Donald Trump, not now, not in the future.
I m not going to be campaigning with him for the next 30 days.
I m doing what I think is best for you, the members, not what s best for me.
I m going to focus my time on campaigning for House Republicans.
Ryan then trashed Trump, suggesting that he was an awful nominee that pretty much had no chance.
He stated the only way the GOP might survive would be to preserve a House majority: It s amazing how easily she could be beaten.
We need a check on Hillary Clinton, if Donald Trump and Mike Pence don t win the presidency.

And obviously a lot has happened since then.
Yes, a lot HAS happened since then but Ryan is still spineless as ever and is now kissing Trump s ass.
The GOP should be ashamed of him.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images
