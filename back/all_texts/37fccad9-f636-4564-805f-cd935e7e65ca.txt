WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will not vote on a bill to replace the Obama administration’s signature healthcare law before it starts a two-week break, a Republican lawmaker said in Wednesday.
“We are going to go home tomorrow without a deal,” said Representative Chris Collins, showing that deep divisions remain among Republicans despite renewed efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare after House Republican leaders withdrew a bill on March 24 due to a lack of votes.
