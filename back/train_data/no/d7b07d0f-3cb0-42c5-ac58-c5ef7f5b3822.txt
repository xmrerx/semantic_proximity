bangkok ( reuters ) - thailand s government on friday announced $ 2.2 billion in loans and handouts to help stabilize prices for rice farmers , a politically influential group whose heartland is in regions where opposition to the military junta is strongest .
thailand s staple food has long been a factor in its politics .
the announcement by the commerce ministry came a week after former prime minister yingluck shinawatra fled into exile ahead of a court verdict in a criminal negligence case over a rice subsidy scheme that cost billions of dollars .
the ministry said it would provide $ 1.57 billion in handouts to farmers and $ 633 million in loans that will cover 3.7 million households .
the program will span the seasonal harvest from the start of november this year to the end of february 2018 .
this is to help take 2 million tonnes of rice from the market , nuntawan sakuntanaga , head of the commerce ministry s department of internal trade , told reporters .
the government introduced similar short-term loans and cash handouts for rice farmers last year that cost the state $ 2.3 billion to cover 4 million households during the same period .
this subsidy program is essentially similar to past rice subsidies introduced by previous governments , said somporn isvilanonda , a senior fellow at the knowledge network institute of thailand who is critical of subsidies .
the bottom line is these cash handouts create more debt for farmers , somporn said .
after hitting a four-year high earlier this year , the price of benchmark thai 5-percent broken white rice has tumbled by nearly 20 percent over the last two months to $ 372.50 per tonne , its lowest since april .
thailand s main rice-growing areas are the northeastern and central regions , which have traditionally been strongholds of support for the populist shinawatra movement of yingluck and her brother thaksin , who was overthrown in a 2006 coup .
