( reuters ) - michigan would tap its $ 575 million fiscal 2015 budget surplus to cover costs related to flint ’ s water crisis , a spokesman for the state ’ s budget office said on thursday .
kurt weiss said that budget director john roberts expects to ask the legislature this month for an appropriation to help flint with short-term costs related to the city ’ s lead-contaminated drinking water .
the financially strapped city was under the control of a state-appointed emergency manager when it switched its source of tap water to the nearby flint river in april 2014 from detroit ’ s water system to save money .
flint , about 60 miles ( 100 km ) northwest of detroit , returned to using detroit water in october after tests found some children had elevated levels of lead in their blood and lead was found in higher-than-acceptable levels in the water .
lead levels were still “ well above ” the acceptable federal level in many homes , city officials said last month .
governor rick snyder this week sent the michigan national guard to distribute bottled water and other supplies to residents .
flint residents left with bills for water declared undrinkable due to lead contamination filed a lawsuit in state court on jan. 7 against snyder , the state , the city and other officials .
the lawsuit filed in genesee county court , which includes flint , seeks class action status covering all residents .
other flint residents late last year filed a federal lawsuit accusing the city and state of endangering their health .
michigan ’ s plan for funding flint ’ s water-related costs came as state officials set revenue estimates for the current and next fiscal years .
for fiscal 2016 , which began on oct. 1 , the estimate for the state ’ s general and school funds was set at $ 22 billion , $ 149 million lower than a projection made in may .
fiscal 2017 revenue was pegged at $ 22.7 billion .
