first she won the coin toss in iowa , and now hillary walks away a winner even though she lost in a landslide to marxist vermont senator , bernie sanders .
never underestimate the power of the clinton machine if you thought bernie sanders won the new hampshire primary , you d be mistaken .
he won the popular vote by 22 percent , but new hampshire has super delegates who don t have to answer to the voters and they re going with hillary ! no wonder the hillary campaign looked like they were throwing a massive party after last night s crushing defeat at the polls.sanders won 60 percent of the vote , but thanks to the democratic party s nominating system , he leaves the granite state with at least 13 delegates while she leaves with at least 15 delegates.new hampshire has 24 pledged delegates , which are allotted based on the popular vote .
sanders has 13 , and clinton has 9 , with 2 currently allotted to neither.but under democratic national committee rules , new hampshire also has 8 superdelegates , party officials who are free to commit to whomever they like , regardless of how their state votes .
their votes count the same as delegates won through the primary.and they call themsleves the democratic party.update : the fix is in for hillary .
if you followed the link to the article , at the bottom is says after a razor-thin victory in iowa and a shellacking in new hampshire , clinton has 394 delegates and sanders has 42 .
