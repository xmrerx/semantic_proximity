london ( reuters ) - wolfgang schaeuble , germany s pro-austerity finance minister , is preparing to quit his job and become head of the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , various sources said on wednesday .
as the following graphic shows , his time as finance chief starting in 2009 has been one of general improvement for germany s economy , if not exactly smooth .
after recovering from the 2007-2008 financial crisis , germany has put in a series of solid growth years .
indeed , although the government s projection of 1.5 percent this year would be slower than 2016 , it is widely expected to be upgraded soon .
germany s leading economic institutes are expecting 1.9 percent growth this year , the same as in 2016 .
with much of the focus of schaeuble s term being on growth , inflation - very low but a german fixation nonetheless - and fiscal rectitude , one macro improvement has been fairly neglected .
the unemployment rate since schaeuble took office has plummeted .
it was above 8 percent when he took the reins at the finance minister ; the latest reading was 5.7 percent , by far the lowest since germany s reunification and some time before that .
gdp per capita is not such a bullish story .
after taking off in the immediate post-crisis years , it has leveled off , suggesting germans may be a bit worse off than they were .
