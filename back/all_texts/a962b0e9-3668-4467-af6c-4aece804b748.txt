Obama would have hurt himself doing this (see video below).
The Corning Glass CEO visited the White House with other business leaders and had President Trump test a specialty glass made by Corning called Valor Glass.
CEO Wendell Weeks had President Trump press the lever on the old glass and then on the new Corning s Valor Glass.The result was awesome!
Weeks told President Trump: My associate wanted me to inform you a thousand pounds is about the same as a punch from a professional boxer.
Trump exerted 1,000 pounds of pressure!REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA WAS FILMED EXERCISING?
HOW COULD WE FORGET!Barack Obama works out at a private gym in Warsaw s 5-star Marriott hotel Ouch!
It almost doesn t seem real.
He s grimacing with 8-10 pound dumbbells in his hands.
How can that be?
