THIS IS HORRIBLE LANGUAGE ALERT!Are you wondering how free to be me Hollyweird would react to a Trump hat-wearing person?
Well, the video below tells us so much about the intolerance of the supposed tolerant Hollywood crowd:There is a disclaimer to the video by two brave souls Blaire White and her boyfriend Joey: We never did anything remotely inflammatory or investigative to anyone.
The point of this video was simply to wear a conservative symbol in a very liberal area.This wasn t so easy Make America great again.
That s bullsh*t!
one bystander shouted.
What do they represent?
Make America white again.
Blaire White who makes YouTube videos for conservatives, eventually runs into more trouble as a random stranger tosses a glass of wine in her face and runs away.
You definitely can t wear a Trump hat in Hollywood, said Joey as the two edit the video later at home.Sadly, White is one of the many conservative voices who have been demonetized by a YouTube run by progressive ideological thought-police.We ve contacted Blaire and hope to hear from her about this.
We can t say enough great things about any American willing to get out there and push back against the intolerance of the left.
Go Blaire!Read more: BPR
