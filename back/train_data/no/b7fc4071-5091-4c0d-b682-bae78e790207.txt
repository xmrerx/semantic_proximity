msnbc s mika brzezinski had a snarkfest with ap reporter julie pace during a series of questions that culminated in her saying that president donald trump s actions on obamacare made him look like an idiot .
these two just brought journalism to a new low with this exchange : pace was speaking about the reasons why republicans were unable to pass a bill to repeal and replace obamacare .
pace said that the white house had people connected on capitol hill who knew that the bill was in trouble .
trump expressed confidence in the bill s passage as late as monday afternoon.brzezinski asked : who s talking to the president before he gets out in front of the cameras at the white house with the vice president behind him saying this is going to be good an hour before this goes down in flames ?
does the right hand know what the left is doing , at all ?
is anybody speaking truth to this president ?

what s president trump supposed to do with snakes like mcconnell and others ?
not to mention the democrats who refuse to work with the president !
this is where the ap reporter gets snarky on the president s moves .
she s referring to the tweets trump sent about mika in this next exchange : i think that you know this better than anybody .
