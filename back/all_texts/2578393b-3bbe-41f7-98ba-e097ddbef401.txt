It s no secret Hispanics hate Donald Trump.
He has record low favorability with them, and there are no signs that support with them will rise in the coming months.
GOP Hispanic leaders and pundits alike, from Republican governor Susana Martinez to CNN s Ana Navarro, have been chastising and distancing themselves from the Republican nominee for President.And another influential Hispanic group is distancing themselves from the nominee in the most public way possible.The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed Ohio governor John Kasich, will be publicly backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and will announce their endorsement live from Cleveland at the RNC.Talk about the ultimate trolling.President of the Chamber, Javier Palomeraz, denounced Trump to the Huffington Post, saying his divisive and racist rhetoric is the reason the group will be backing Clinton:We believe it is appropriate for us to weigh in and say enough is enough What we re hearing from Donald Trump in his campaign: divisive, mean-spirited language [that] has marginalized Hispanics, immigrants, American POWs, Muslims, women, the disabled and the list goes on.After public spats with Palomeraz, in which Trump cancelled events planned, the Clinton campaign was right there to attend, listen, and learn about the needs of Hispanic business owners.
The Clinton campaign also was repeatedly in touch with the Chamber in an effort to reach out to communities using a slew of business leaders familiar with their needs.No wonder they re endorsing Clinton.
It s no secret that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pro-Republican, pro-Conservative.
But their opinion isn t the only representation of business in America.While Trump flunks the presidential test (yet again), Clinton picks up the pieces and offers her hand in support.
It s no wonder more unions and business leaders have endorsed her than Trump.
The Republican nominee looks out for one person and one person only himself.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images
