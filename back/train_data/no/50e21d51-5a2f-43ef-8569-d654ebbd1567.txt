yangon ( reuters ) - myanmar police arrested on sunday an ultra-nationalist buddhist monk who has a history of stoking sentiment against rohingya muslims , the country s beleaguered minority , a myanmar newspaper reported .
parmaukkha was held under an arrest warrant for his role in an unauthorized protest outside the u.s. embassy in yangon last year , according to the voice s website .
the monk was detained when he went to dagon myothit ( north ) police station in myanmar s biggest city to apply for permission to protest outside a municipal building .
that protest concerned a local issue unrelated to the crisis in rakhine state , where a military campaign has forced more than 600,000 rohingya to flee to bangladesh since late august .
reuters was unable to contact the station or yangon s police chief by telephone .
the arrest comes just days before u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson visits myanmar on nov. 15 to meet with the country s leadership for talks on the rohingya crisis .
parmaukkha was a co-founder of ma ba tha , the burmese language acronym for the association for protection of race and religion , but he quit the radical buddhist and anti-muslim group last year , citing political differences .
parmaukkha had told reuters that ma ba tha had lent support to the union solidarity and development party ( usdp ) during the 2015 election , in a vain bid to stop aung san suu kyi s national league for democracy from winning power .
the demonstration outside the u.s. embassy in 2016 was to protest the united state s policy of using the term rohingya for the muslims in northern parts of rakhine .
many people in myanmar regard the largely stateless rohingya as illegal immigrants from bangladesh , and they are excluded from the 135 national races recognized by law .
at the time of the protest last year , an embassy spokesman said the united states supports the right to demonstrate and added that around the world , people have the ability to self-identify .
