An official within Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign appeared to have discussions with sources inside the Department of Justice (DOJ) about ongoing open records lawsuits regarding the former secretary of State s emails, according to an email released on Tuesday.In an email from May 2015, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said that DOJ folks had inform[ed] him about an upcoming status conference in one of the lawsuits regarding Clinton s private email setup.
The information about an upcoming court event would have been public knowledge and open for all to attend.
And it s unclear whether the people Fallon spoke to at the Justice Department were officials who regularly communicate with the public.
However, the fact that Fallon a former spokesman with the Department of Justice remained in contact with anyone from the department is likely to renew allegations that the Obama administration maintained an especially cozy relationship with the former secretary of State s presidential campaign.On Tuesday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said the connection was unbelievable .The email shows a level of collusion which calls into question the entire investigation into her private server, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Department of Justice must release all communications with the Clinton campaign and her allies as soon as possible in order to definitively prove their investigation was completely above board.
