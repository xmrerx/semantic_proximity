This is why Trump is getting the great numbers and large crowds.
He s being the anti-candidate and saying what s on his mind instead of scripted answers like the other candidates.
It s real refreshing.
He s commenting on what happened when the Black Lives Matter thugs ran Bernie Sanders off of a stage during a rally.
Trump couldn t be more on target with his remarks.
