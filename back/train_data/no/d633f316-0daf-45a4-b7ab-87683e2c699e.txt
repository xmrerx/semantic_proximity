us army m1126 stryker armoured vehicles rolled into syria this week ( source : twitter ) 21st century wire says yesterday reports emerged of a us heavy armoured convoy heeding through northern syria , heading towards a forward position near the flashpoint city of manbij , near the isis stronghold of raqqa .
not surprisingly , this news which would normally be strewn across all headlines and tv news leader boards has been completely blacked-out by the us media , aside from some website mentions.naturally , americans have to go to rt to get news about what the us military is doing in far-flung destinations .
here is a video report by rt s ruptly news agency which shows the us servicemen leading a convoy of stryker armoured vehicles in the syrian countryside : according to military blog sofrep , call signs indicate that this us battalion is based out of fort benning , georgia .
by looking at the call sign tag on the back of the stryker , it is evident that this is 3rd ranger battalion out of fort benning , georgia , which has been confirmed via other sources .
this clearly indicates that the trump administration is in the process of actively building up its military presence in syria .
to what degree is unclear , although early indications suggest a similar commitment to what the us has laid-on in mosul in their joint operation to retake that iraqi city away from isis control.currently , the us is at odds with nato ally turkey over the pentagon s support of the kurdish ypg whom turkey has designated as a terrorist organization .
this could be a point of contention going forward , as the us , russia and turkey conduct trilateral negotiations this week in antalya , turkey this week.stay tuned to 21wire for more updatesread more syria news at : 21st century wire syria filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @ 21wire.tv
