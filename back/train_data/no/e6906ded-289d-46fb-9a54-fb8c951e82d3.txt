istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish state lender halkbank on thursday denied allegations that it was involved in illegal transactions designed to help iran avoid u.s. sanctions , following testimony in new york against its former deputy general manager .
our bank has not been a part to any transaction which is uncertain and illegal relating to any country and has not executed any transfer transaction which is uncertain and unlawful , it said in a statement .
there is no systematic and conscious violation of transactions ... as it is alleged and it has not been intermediated in the export of prohibited parties and goods .
its comments came after iranian-turkish gold trader reza zarrab on wednesday told a u.s. federal court that he helped iran use funds deposited in halkbank to buy gold that was smuggled to dubai and sold for cash .
zarrab , who has pleaded guilty , is testifying against halkbank executive mehemt hakan atilla , who has pleaded not guilty .
