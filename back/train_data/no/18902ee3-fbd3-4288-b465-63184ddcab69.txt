this has just got to end !
we have kids pouring across our border and they are not going home .
it s a literal invasion with the obama administration s approval.pinal county , az sheriff and congressional candidate paul babeu ( r ) stated , just the last two months alone , we ve had 10,000 unaccompanied juveniles who are staying here and that the obama administration says the border is wide open , that there is no law it comes to immigration on monday s cavuto : coast to coast on the fox business network .
he added , we re a compassionate nation .
we always have been .
and this is where i m tired of being shouted down by president obama , like somehow we re not good americans if we don t do everything that he says we should to do .
and we ve had a million legal immigrants last year , and we do this every year .
babeu continued , i think it s the most compassionate thing we can do , is reunite them with their families in central america .
what america should be doing is finding ways to solve the problems of violence in central america , support their governments , because if we don t solve that core problem , this isn t going to end .
we re going to have this problem next month , next year , and then we own these people , and all the social network to support them for their entire lives .
because if you think that these kids are going anywhere , think again .
they re staying here .
babeu further argued , our compassion , there has to be a limit to this .
and we don t see people in europe , in the countries there , taking kids refugees from central america , yet everybody wants us to take syrian refugees from halfway across the world .
so , where s the fairness here ?
