A longtime Republican activist in Wisconsin is so disgusted by Donald Trump s groping comment and GOP refusal to unendorse him that she just quit the party and ripped them a new one on Twitter.Marybeth Glenn has always defended Republicans against charges of sexism but Donald Trump s remarks about grabbing women by the p*ssy are so indefensible that she was disgusted that most Republicans still support him as the nominee.In fact, she is so disgusted that she fired off a series of posts on Twitter blasting the GOP for continuing to endorse this piece of human garbage.
She then quit the party and said they deserve to be called sexists.Here s the full takedown via Twitter.So let me get this straight: I, a conservative female, have spent years defending the Republican Party against claims of sexism.
1/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016When I saw Republican men getting attacked I stood up for them.
I came to their defense.
I fought on their behalf.
2/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016I fought on behalf of a movement I believed in.
I fought on behalf of my principles while other women told me I hated my own sex.
3/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Not only charges of sexism, but I defended @marcorubio during Go8, I fought in my state to stop the @ScottWalker recall, etc Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Now some Trojan horse nationalist sexual predator invades the @GOP, eating it alive, and you cowards sit this one out?
5/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016He treats women like dogs, and you go against everything I and other female conservatives said you were & back down like cowards.
6/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Get this straight: We don t need you to stand up for us, YOU needed to stand up for us for YOU.
For YOUR dignity.
For YOUR reputation.
7/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Jeff Sessions says that he wouldn t characterize Trump s unauthorized groping of women as assault.
Are you kidding me?!
8/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Others try to rebuke his comments, yet STILL choose to vote for a sexual predator because let s be honest, that s what he is.
9/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016 What he said is wrong, and the way he treats women is wrong, but it s not wrong enough for me to not vote for him.
Thanks, cowards.
10/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Various men in the movement are writing it off as normal, confirming every stereotype the left has thrown at them.
So I m done.
11/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016I m sooo done.
If you can t stand up for women & unendorse this piece of human garbage, you deserve every charge of sexism thrown at you.
12 Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016I m just one woman, you won t even notice my lack of presence at rallies, fair booths, etc., You won t really care that I m offended 13/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016by your silence, and your inability to take a stand.
But one by one you ll watch more women like me go, & you ll watch men of 14/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016ACTUAL character follow us out the door.
And what you ll be left with are the corrupt masses that foam at the mouth every time you step 15/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Outside the lines.
Men who truly see women as lesser beings, & women without self-respect.
& your guiding faith & principles will be 16/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Attached to them as well.
And when it s all said and done, all you ll have left is the party The Left always accused you of being.
Scum.
17/ Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016CC: @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz @marcorubio @SpeakerRyan @Reince And every other tool refusing to unendorse this monster.
17/X Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016Over 70 percent of women view Trump unfavorably, and it looks like that number is going to skyrocket only less than a month to go before Election Day.
Furthermore, Republicans are in serious jeopardy of losing women voters by historic margins that may take many years to reverse.
And they only have themselves to blame.Featured image via Facebook
