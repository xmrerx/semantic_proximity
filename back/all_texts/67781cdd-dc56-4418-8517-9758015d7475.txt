Sir Patrick Stewart, like any sane person in or outside of the U.S., has a severe problem with Donald Trump and everything he stands for.
He s so determined to oppose Trump in everything he does that he s doing something absolutely incredible: He s applied for U.S. citizenship.
Speaking on The View, he said his friends were telling him how he can help: All of my friends in Washington said, There is one thing you can do.
Fight, fight, oppose, oppose.
But how do you do that when you re a resident and citizen of a foreign country?
Yes, Stewart is British and the U.K. is one of our biggest, best and closest allies, but he s still a foreign national.
It seems he feels that, as a foreigner, his ability to help us out is limited.
Joy Behar jokingly asked him if he d be willing to take Trump off our hands, and his initial reply was, We have our own problems.
That was in reference to Brexit, which was the dumbest thing a Western nation had done in recent history right up until we told the U.K. to hold our beer while we held an election.
But then he dropped this: I m not a [U.S.] citizen.
However, there is, maybe it s the only good thing, as the result of this election: I am now applying for citizenship.
Because I want to be an American too.
Is there a more meaningful way to help us resist the growing corrupt, authoritarian regime occupying the White House?
