If you couldn t figure out that Donald Trump was a scam artist and a fraud before the election, you re likely figuring that out now.
And if you still haven t, just wait, you will soon.Throughout the course of Trump s campaign for the presidency he promised that he d bring change to Washington DC.
That he would be the outsider to come in and save the day.
Shake things up.
Rattle the chains.By the end of Trump s campaign he even kept using the ridiculous bumper sticker-like slogan Drain the Swamp to describe what he would do the establishment politicians in DC and lobbyists.
He campaigned on getting rid of politics as usual, but now we re learning, nope, he s just the same and he scammed everyone who voted for him.Calling this bulls*t out perfectly was none other than this badass female Senator from the great state of Missouri, Senator Claire McCaskill (D).Sen.

So far all Wall Street and consummate DC insiders.

Trump isn t Draining the swamp he s adding to it, as anyone with any foresight into Trump s scam artist ways could have told you long before he became the president-elect.Good on McCaskill for calling Trump s BS out where no one else seems to want to.
He still the scam artist and fraud we always knew he was and is only in this for his self-interests and the interests of his corporate cronies.Featured Photo by Steve Pope/Getty Images
