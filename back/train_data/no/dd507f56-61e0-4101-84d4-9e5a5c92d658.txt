madrid ( reuters ) - the spanish government could use constitutional powers to suspend catalonia s autonomy and prevent the region from splitting from spain , prime minister mariano rajoy said in an interview to newspaper el pais published late on saturday .
asked if he was ready to trigger the article 155 of the constitution , which enables him to sack the regional government and call a fresh local election , rajoy answered : i don t rule out absolutely anything that is within the law ...
ideally , it shouldn t be necessary to implement extreme solutions but for that not to happen things would have to be changed .
rajoy also said he planned to leave in catalonia the extra 4,000 police officers the government had shipped in to region for an independence vote on oct. 1 until the crisis was over .
the conservative prime minister added he would not call a snap national election as a result of the political crisis and ruled out using mediation to resolve it .
