OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Protests against Donald Trump broke out in California’s Bay Area late on Tuesday after the Republican candidate won the U.S. presidential election, a Reuters witness and local media reported.
Demonstrators set fire to a likeness of Trump, smashed store front windows and set garbage and tires on fire in downtown Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco.
A few miles away, University of California, Berkeley students protested on campus.
A demonstration also unfolded at the University of California, Davis where students blocked streets as they marched and chanted anti-Trump slogans and “You are not America, we are America,” according to Twitter posts.
One protester in Oakland was struck by a vehicle after blocking a highway, local media reported.
