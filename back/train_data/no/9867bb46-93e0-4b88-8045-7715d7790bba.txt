kabul ( reuters ) - the afghan air force took delivery of its first four u.s.-made uh-60 black hawk helicopters on tuesday as part of a planned replacement of its aging fleet of russian-made mi-17 helicopters , officials said .
the u.s. plans to supply a total of 159 black hawks to afghanistan in the coming years as it boosts the capacity of the aaf , considered one of the best-performing parts of the afghan defence and security forces .
the first afghan air force uh-60s arrived today in kandahar .
they will help further develop a capable and sustainable aaf , the nato-led resolute support mission said .
the robust soviet-era mi-17 is the workhorse of the aaf , accounting for around half of all sorties in recent months and is very popular with afghan pilots .
as well as moving troops and casualties and flying in supplies to areas difficult to reach by road , the helicopters can also be fitted with weapons for close air support to units on the ground .
however their age makes them increasingly difficult to maintain and replace and they are to be phased out over the coming years and replaced with refurbished black hawks , one of the mainstays of the u.s. army s helicopter force .
according to a report in july by the special inspector general for afghanistan , a u.s. congressional watchdog , 19 of the aaf s 46-strong mi-17 fleet were unusable because they were undergoing overhaul or repair .
in addition to operational considerations , the pentagon has also long faced political pressure from congress to switch spending to u.s.-built aircraft .
strengthening the afghan air force is a central part of president ashraf ghani s four year plan to improve afghan security forces which have struggled to contain the taliban insurgency since the nato-led coalition backing the government ended its main combat operations in 2014 .
