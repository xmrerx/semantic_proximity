BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and France will ask the European Union to consult about the possibility of imposing heavier sanctions on North Korea after its latest nuclear test, Germany s government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday.
It is exclusively North Korea, its leadership, and President Kim who are responsible for this provocation, Seibert told a news conference, adding Pyongyang s ambassador would again be summoned to the Foreign Ministry.
North Korea is treading all over international law.
Berlin was in favor of a diplomatic, peaceful solution to the crisis, he said, adding this required a coordinated response from the entire world - Not just the western world, but Russia and China too.
