WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will continue to pay subsidies for low-income Americans receiving healthcare coverage under Obamacare, but no decisions have been made about future funding, a White House official said on Wednesday.
“While we agreed to go ahead and make the ... payments for now, we haven’t made a final decision about future commitments,” the official said.
