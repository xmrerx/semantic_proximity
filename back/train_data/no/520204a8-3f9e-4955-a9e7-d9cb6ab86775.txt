donald trump is a pathetic loser.despite repeatedly claiming that he s a winner who never settles court cases filed against him , trump settled the lawsuit against trump university on friday by agreeing to pay $ 25 million in restitution to the plaintiffs who were screwed over by his scam school.during the campaign , trump vowed that he would win the case against him .
clearly , he lied about that , too .
but he s already making excuses on twitter.i settled the trump university lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as president i have to focus on our country .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) november 19 , 2016the only bad thing about winning the presidency is that i did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on trump u .
too bad !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) november 19 , 2016once again , trump couldn t just let things go .
he had to jump on social media to whine and make excuses in a desperate effort to save face among his supporters.but everyone one saw right through trump and mocked him .

emma kennedy ( @ emmakennedy ) november 19 , 2016 @ realdonaldtrump you would have lost which is why you settled .
only losers settle .
which means you re a loser .
sad our president is a loser .
terrence o brien ( @ terrenceobrien ) november 19 , 2016donald trump would not have won these cases and he knows it .
that s why he really settled .
if he were truly focused on governing this country he would stop getting on twitter to whine and attack those who disagree with him .
but trump only cares about himself and his own image.featured image : spencer platt/getty images
