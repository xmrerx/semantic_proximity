SEOUL (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering attending the winter Olympics in South Korea in February despite escalating tension after North Korea s latest missile test on Wednesday, the South s presidential office said.
Abe raised the possibility of attending the games during a telephone call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in which they said they would no longer tolerate North Korea s increasing security threats and they would tighten sanctions and pressure against it, Moon s press secretary, Yoon Young-chan, told a news briefing.
