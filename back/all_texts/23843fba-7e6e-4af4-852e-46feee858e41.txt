Maxine Waters is one angry woman.
She has gone non-stop with attacks on President Trump since he was elected.
Speaking to the Westchester-Playa Democratic Club at an LA church in April, Waters defended illegal immigrants, saying America is their country.
No, America is not their country.
This is their country!
THE QUEEN OF THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT: But, we ve got to resist that.
We ve not only got to resist that, we ve got to stand up for our friends, for our neighbors.
It is what God would have us do I m hoping and praying that this wall will never be built, and if we impeach him, we know it s not going to get built.
WHAT ABOUT THE WALL?
AUNTIE MAXINE HAS A WALL!
