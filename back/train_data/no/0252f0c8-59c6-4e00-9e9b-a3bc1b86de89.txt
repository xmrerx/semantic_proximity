moscow ( reuters ) - the kremlin said on monday that it was in touch with the french government over a possible visit to russia next year by president emmanuel macron , but that nothing had yet been confirmed .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov , on a conference call with reporters , was responding to a report in the kommersant daily newspaper which said that paris was ready to accept an invitation for macron to visit the st petersburg international economic forum in may .
the participation of the french side ( in the forum ) is in moscow s interests , said peskov .
as you know , france is a very important partner of the russian federation .
peskov said that putin s first meeting with macron , at the palace of versailles in may this year , had been characterized by a very positive momentum .
proceeding from this , we of course would be glad to see french businesses at the st petersburg forum ... and there are contacts regarding high-level participation , but i wouldn t run ahead of myself for now .
