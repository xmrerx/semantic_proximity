Most of the people with brains in this country knew that Donald Trump, a reality television star, was not fit to be the next President of the United States and should not be allowed anywhere near the White House.
Unfortunately, Trump was able to rile up enough hate and divisiveness in this country to get himself elected, but he s already proving that he s going to be a disastrous Commander-in-chief.No one has to look any further than Trump s Twitter account to understand how much of a mistake electing him was.
Despite the fact that he promised he would be restrained on social media, Trump is incapable of changing.
And instead of getting to work and laying out his vision for the country, he spent several hours on Sunday attacking The New York Times.
Are you embarrassed for America?
You should be.Here s how our thin-skinned President-elect went after a top newspaper:Twitter(It s worth mentioning that although Trump continues to deny that he ever said Japan should have nukes, he most certainly did say that.
)But seriously, Presidents who actually do their job don t spend hours on Twitter attacking the free press.
They don t have time, and they have more important things to focus on things that go beyond what Trump is capable of handling.The New York Times didn t hesitate to call Trump out on his lies:TwitterWe re proud of our election coverage & we will continue to hold power to account.
Here s what we told our employees & our subscribers: pic.twitter.com/dcaTrAS4mU NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016It s safe to say that Trump didn t actually believe he was going to win the election, and he s miserable now that he has.
His priorities have not changed one bit since becoming the President-elect.
Trump has no real interest in actually running the country, and his Twitter account proves that he s going to fail and pull the rest of America down with him.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
