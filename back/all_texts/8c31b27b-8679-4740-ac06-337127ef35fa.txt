Snitches get stitches is Kremlin s message to the United States at least according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, anyway.
Discussing Rex Tillerson s planned visit to Russia, Zakharova complained about the leaks coming out of the Trump administration:First, the US Department of State asked us to keep the planned visit quiet and not to announce it until the last possible minute, until we coordinated the date.
We did as they asked.
But a day or two later the information was leaked by the US State Department and sometimes by the US administration.
Frankly, this put Russia and the media in a strange situation, because they didn t know who to believe the official agencies or the many leaks.If the Trump administration continues leaking like a colander, she says, there will be consequences:Also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington in the past few years, continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama s terms in office.
Believe me, this could be very interesting information.Recently, Trump has been in a panic trying to contain leaks particularly about his and his administration s relationship with Russia.At this point, it is fair to ask: what do they have on him and other Republicans?
Is this threat to release Obama-era information a veiled warning to The Donald to plug the holes through which facts are slipping?Featured image via Getty Images (Mikhail Svetlov/Pool)
