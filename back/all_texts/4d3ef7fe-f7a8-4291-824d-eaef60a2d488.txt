Donald Trump may be one of the most bitter, petty people on the planet.
Several weeks ago, Trump announced that he would not be attending the White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington because he couldn t handle the media s criticism.
As the WH Correspondents Dinner finally took place last night without Trump, he basically threw a fit during a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania because the event was held without the president.
If Trump expected the annual event to be canceled because the country s commander-in-chief decided to be a temperamental man-baby, he was proven wrong last night and obviously couldn t handle the fact that the media and several celebrities still wanted to go.
In an unhinged, unpresidential rant, Trump blasted the media and all in attendance of the WH Correspondents Dinner.Trump lied and said he could not possibly more thrilled to be far away from the Washington swamp , where the reporters were consoling each other in a hotel ballroom.
Trump then bragged about the size of his crowds in comparison to the dinner before pointing to the cameras and saying they would actually rather be here.
Trump s delusional fans loved every second of it, and were soon chanting CNN sucks , encouraging Trump to go off even more on fake news .
He said: They would love to be with us here tonight, but they re trapped at the dinner which will be very, very boring.
With the encouragement from the crowd, Trump then recycled all his usual attacks, such as Hillary Clinton and the New York Times a tactic Trump regularly uses because he isn t intelligent enough to talk about his actual policies.If there was ever a speech that displayed just how insecure and small-minded Trump is, it was this one.
