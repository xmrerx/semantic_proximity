montreal ( reuters ) - a canadian jury on tuesday found a man guilty of possessing an explosive substance but cleared him and his partner of three terrorism-related charges after the government alleged they were trying to build a bomb with ingredients that included christmas lights .
the montreal couple , el mahdi jamali and sabrine djermane , were charged with trying to leave canada to join a terrorist group , possessing an explosive substance , facilitating a terrorist activity and committing an offense for a terrorist group .
jamali , now 20 , was found guilty of a reduced charge of possessing explosives without a lawful excuse and acquitted of other charges .
jamali was given credit for time served and ordered released during a tuesday afternoon hearing .
he was also prohibited from owning a firearm for 10 years .
djermane , 21 , was acquitted of all charges .
the two had been detained since they were arrested in 2015 , when they were teenagers .
the royal canadian mounted police found a handwritten bomb-making recipe copied from a propaganda magazine published by al qaeda militants when the police searched a condo rented by the couple in 2015 , according to prosecutors .
the two were arrested at a time when international security forces reported that college students from montreal were among waves of young people heading to syria to join islamic state militants .
rcmp began investigating the couple after receiving a tip , and arrested them days later .
canadian prosecutor lyne decarie said she has not ruled out filing an appeal and would examine the judge s instructions to the jury .
the government has 30 days to file an appeal .
