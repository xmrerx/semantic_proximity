The Republican Party has been a thorn in the side of the president since he took office.
They have challenged his policies at almost every corner and at times just for the sake of it, thus preventing the country from running smoothly.
Even now, as the president is close to the end of his final term, the GOP is not letting up.
In their latest attempt at obstructionism, the Republican Party is attempting to scuttle the president s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.
President Barack Obama appeared on Fox News Sunday for the first time as president and had a few things to say about Republican obstructionism.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHqWf81IbDA]The president wants the GOP to simply do one thing, which is to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing in order for the American people to be given an opportunity to see what his nominee is all about.
The president said: I think that people will evolve as they get familiar with Judge Garland s record, as it becomes apparent that the overwhelming majority of the American people think that the president should nominate someone to the Supreme Court and the Senate should now do its constitutional job and give him a hearing Our goal is to just make sure that the senate does its job and treats him fairly.
The Republicans want the next president to nominate a justice to the Supreme Court, hoping that a Republican president would appoint a conservative justice.
The president went on to add that never has a Republican nominee for the Supreme Court not at least had a hearing.
Yet, here are the Republicans yet again scuttling by preventing the president from doing his job and not doing their constitutional duties as well.The Republicans continue to obstruct but let s hope that they remain on the sidelines come November and we don t have to deal with a GOP presidential administration.
