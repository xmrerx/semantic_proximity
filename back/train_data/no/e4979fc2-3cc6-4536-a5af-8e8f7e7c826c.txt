just another day in the holy month of ramadan london is the scene of carnage again with another terror attack .
a van plowed into pedestrians on london bridge with reports of men jumping out of the van to stab random people .
we re posting details as they come in from the uk .
several people have been killed and the latest update is that 5 armed terrorists are on the run in london.meanwhile , a video has been posted on social media showing what appears to be muslim men who have just witnessed the london bridge terror attack and are simply observers of a horrific terror attack against innocent people .
you can hear them speaking in arabic and saying something about 3 attacks , after which time you can hear one of them yell , allah akbar !
it s interesting to hear how the muslim men in the vehicle respond to the murder of innocent people at the hands of islamic extremists .
after watching this video , one has to wonder how exactly , we should go about differentiating between the moderate and extremist muslims muslims laughing and yelling allah ackbar in london after # londonbridge attack pic.twitter.com/6xjlwwqqq7 tanya tay ( @ realtanyatay ) june 3 , 2017
