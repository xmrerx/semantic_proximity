Even though the big news was that President Trump got a BIG win with the passage in the Senate last night of his tax bill, the press was stuck on the topic of Mike Flynn s guilty plea.
POTUS was asked as he was leaving the White House this morning if he s worried about Flynn s guilty plea He had a firm answer then tried to remind the press that last night was a big win for him JUST IN: President Trump makes first comments after Michael Flynn's guilty plea.Reporter: "Are you concerned about what Mike Flynn might tell the special counsel?
"Trump: "No, I'm not."

The Democrats have to be beside themselves after this huge win for Trump and Republicans.
Maxine Waters was on with Joy Reid this morning saying this was all doom and gloom We say MAGA!
TRUMP 2020!
