ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey s talks with the United States over an on-going visa crisis are headed in a good direction , President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman said on Wednesday.
Visa operations were mutually suspended by the two countries on Oct. 8, in a widening diplomatic row over Ankara s arrest of Turkish national employed by the U.S. consulate in Istanbul.
A delegation from the United States arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to discuss the resolution of the crisis.
Erdogan s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, made the comment in an interview broadcast by state channel TRT Haber.
