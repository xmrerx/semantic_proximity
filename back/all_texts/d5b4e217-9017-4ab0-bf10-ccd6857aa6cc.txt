JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel s intelligence minister said U.S. President Donald Trump s speech against the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday was very significant and could lead to war given threats that preceded it from Tehran.
Israel s Channel 2 TV asked Intelligence Minister Israel Katz whether he saw a risk of war after Trump s speech.
Absolutely, yes.
I think that the speech was very significant, Katz responded.
Iran is the new North Korea.
We see where things are goings.
