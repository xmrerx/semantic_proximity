san salvador ( reuters ) - former salvadoran president armando calderon , who helped oversee the central american country s transition from a bloody civil war to peace in the 1990s , has died at the age of 69 after a battle with cancer , his family said on monday .
calderon , who was president from 1994 to 1999 as the reconstruction of the divided country took hold , died around midnight in a hospital in houston where he was admitted in critical condition with an undisclosed form of cancer .
el salvador s 1980-1992 civil war , which pitted a u.s.-backed right-wing government against the leftist guerilla farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) , claimed some 75,000 lives and left around another 8,000 people missing .
a founder of the powerful , right-wing nationalist republican alliance ( arena ) , calderon as president ushered in a string of business-friendly economic reforms including a privatization of the telecoms sector and the pension system .
el salvador s supreme court of justice in 2016 ordered an investigation into calderon s fortune on suspicion of illicit enrichment .
the former president , who was also mayor of san salvador between 1988 and 1994 , rejected the accusations .
