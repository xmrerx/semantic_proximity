Yet another Republican is leaving the party in protest of Donald Trump.Donald Trump is doing more to destroy the Republican Party from within than Democrats have ever done simply by being the sane party of the two.Ever since it became clear that Trump would be the Republican nominee several Republicans have left the party in disgust.
The most prominent member of the exodus thus far has been conservative columnist George Will, who has loathed Trump for months before finally cutting ties with the party he had been a part of for many years.Just last week, a Texas Republican who had been with the party for his whole life resigned with an epic letter to the local party chair in his district, refusing to be one of the good Nazis.
On Monday, a Utah Republican state senator also called it quits with the party.And now a former US Attorney appointed by George W. Bush just told the Republican Party to go f*ck themselves via Facebook.In the now-deleted post, Marcos Daniel Jimenez wrote that he can t stand being in the party of hate any longer.
This has not been easy to write, and I ve thought a lot about it.
God has blessed me and my family beyond our dreams.
I ve had the privilege and honor to see my brother work for Governor Jeb Bush, to be appointed to a Senate-confirmed office by President George W. Bush, and see my brother also appointed to a Senate-confirmed office by the same president.
But I have decided that I will no longer be associated in any way with a party that is led by a bigoted, dangerous demagogue and that has become a party dominated by fear, anger and hate.
Republicans should make no mistake about this.
You now clearly belong to the party of hate you are supporting a strongman who believes all of that.
This is not good news for the Republican Party but they only have themselves to blame.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
