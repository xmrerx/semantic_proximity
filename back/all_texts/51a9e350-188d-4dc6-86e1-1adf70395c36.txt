President Trump gave the commencement speech for the Coast Guard graduating class and hit back at the media during the speech: The Coast Guard Academy was the location for the speech but the speech could be directed at all Aemricans plus the media and critics of Trump.
He says what everyone else is thinking Awesome!
Now I want to take this opportunity to offer you some advice.
Over the course of your life you will find that things are not always fair.
You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve You have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight!
Never ever, ever give up.
Things will turn out just fine .
No politician in history has been treated worse or more unfairly.
You can t let them get you down.
You can t let the critics and naysayers get in the way of your dreams.
TRUMP ADDED: The people understand what I m doing and that s the most important thing.
I didn t t get elected to serve the Washington media or the special interests, he said.
I got elected to serve the forgotten men and women and that s what I m doing.
Great speech!
He nails it!FULL SPEECH:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNzZXf2gk7U
