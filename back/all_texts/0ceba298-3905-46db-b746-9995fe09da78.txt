WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday voted to confirm former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, installing the Trump administrationâ€™s point-man on tax reform, financial deregulation and economic diplomacy efforts.
The Senate voted 53-47 in a largely party-line vote to approve the nomination.
Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the only Democrat to vote in favor of Mnuchin.
