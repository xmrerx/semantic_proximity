london ( reuters ) - prime minister theresa may s senior minister will not have to resign over claims that police found pornography on a work computer and that he made an inappropriate sexual advance against a young woman , itv political editor robert peston said on monday .
first secretary of state damian green will be told on wednesday that the cabinet office and the prime minister will inform him that he can keep his job , peston said on his facebook page .
may s office declined to comment on the report .
peston said no other women came forward to present evidence against green and that police testimony does not prove he watched the porn on the parliamentary computer .
two retired police officers alleged the pornography was discovered on green s computer by officers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008 .
earlier on monday , a spokesman for the prime minister said there are procedures to go through in the investigation and once they are complete the government will publish the findings .
green , who is a close ally of may , has denied the allegations .
if green is cleared it would be a boost to the prime minister after she lost two ministers last month : one was forced to quit in a sexual harassment scandal and another over undisclosed meetings with israeli officials .
