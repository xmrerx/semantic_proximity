christian and jewish songs will be performed as well , but the ramadan song is getting all the attention.it started with a post on facebook .
a parent of a ninth-grade blaine choir student posted the lyrics to the song the choir has been practicing .
when others learned students would be singing the song on thursday , the comments took a turn.one person posted , no child should be forced to sing a song about the muslims and the religion of hatred .
another parent , who didn t want to be identified , told wcco phone that considering the recent events in paris and san bernardino , singing a song about allah would be insensitive .
