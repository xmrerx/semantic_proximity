Sometimes in life you just need to state the obvious, especially if you re Fox News and your viewers still need to be reminded not to eat paste.It s pretty common knowledge that a president is only allowed to serve two terms in office, so either the folks over on Fox & Friends think that their viewers are stupid, they are reminding themselves, or this is brand new information to them and they think they are reporting breaking news for the first time.During the segment they showed President Obama explaining some of his biggest regrets as president, and how he wouldn t want to run for a third term even if he could, because it would be too big of a toll on his family.
It was then that the hosts maneuvered their right-wing spin into saying that Hillary Clinton would be a third term of Obama.However, the most baffling part of the segment, alongside their love for George W. Bush, was when they were literally talking about a third term for Obama and what that would mean.
Brian Kilmeade, while reading a tweet that read, I believe he would beat anybody in the current GOP crop decided to follow it up by saying: That could be the case.
We ll see.
Which is when Steve Doocy had to chime in and remind his cohost alongside viewers at home: But then again, he can t run.
So, he wouldn t be running.
Oh, Brian Kilmeade, there s a reason Bobby Moynihan portrays you as so scatterbrained and unintelligent on SNL, because you are.This really shouldn t be something that has to be explained to anyone in this day and age, but when dealing with Fox News and Fox News viewers, well, they seem to need a little bit more time to grasp facts and reality.
Honestly, the look on Doocy s face as he explains to Kilmeade that Obama can t run again is priceless.Watch for yourself: Video/Featured image: C&L
