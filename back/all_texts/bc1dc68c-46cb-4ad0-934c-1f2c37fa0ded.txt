ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that allegations there had been a secret deal between Moscow and Donald Trump before his inauguration as U.S. president were “hysteria.” “There was nothing concrete, zero.
It’s just hysteria.
Should I give you a pill?” Putin told a moderator when asked about a possible deal between Trump and Moscow.
Putin, addressing the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, accused the United States of carrying out “crude and systematic interference in Russian affairs for many years”.
