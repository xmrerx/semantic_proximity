Donald Trump thought he hit a slam dunk with moderate and independent voters when he decided to visit Mexico.
Pundits and right-wing demagogues declared it presidential and said the visit was proof of a softening on immigration.Then Trump went to Arizona, and well, that all changed.Instead of taking a softer approach to the issues of Mexico, immigration and illegal immigration, Trump launched into his classic talking points that a wall will be built (and that Mexico will pay for it), that the United States is being swamped with 30 million illegal immigrants (even though that number is closer to 11 million), and that Mexican immigration poses the same threat as ISIS.Well the speech In Arizona was the last straw for one Trump adviser, Jacob M. Monty, who advises the Republican nominee on Latino issues, among other things.Just last week, Monty posted on his Facebook that Trump is the only candidate who has the skill and will to work with Congress to improve security and deal compasionately with the undocumented population in the US.
In a Facebook post on Thursday, Monty denounced Trump and severed ties after he refused to take his advice and instead pandered to xenophobia:And with that, another Trump staffer leaves do to the candidate s blatant racism, xenophobia and lack of respect for those who know what s best.Although Monty has not said who he will be supporting at this point for the presidency, Trump s camp should take the opportunity to truly reflect on who they want to vote for him: the angry whites that will vote for him regardless of how soft he goes on immigration, or conservative leaning Hispanic and Latino voters he desperately needs?Another public embarrassment for the Trump campaign couldn t have come quick enough.
This Mexico trip certainly did not work out well in the candidate s favor.Thank you, Jacob Monty, for putting principle over party!
Maybe this decision will have Trump s closest advisers thinking long and hard about how to pursue sensitive issues that affect millions of proud people.Featured image via Jacob M. Monty/Facebook
