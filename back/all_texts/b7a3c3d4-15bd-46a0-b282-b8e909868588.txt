Sheriff Clarke: Barack Obama for seven plus years has played the race card that every time somebody criticized him it was because he was black and it scared off a lot of Republicans.
So now they re going to switch and try to play the gender card.
Problem is the American public is tired of this class warfare.
The reason why they don t like Mrs. Bill Clinton is not because she s a woman.
It s because she s dishonest and because she s hiding something.
She s hiding the truth.
She tries to play herself off as a victim like she s little red riding hood but she s more like the big bad wolf.
As soon as you turn your back on her, she ll bite you.
Look this is politics.
It s a contact sport.
It s not for the faint of heart.
