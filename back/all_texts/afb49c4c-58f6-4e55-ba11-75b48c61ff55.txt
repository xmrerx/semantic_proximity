ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that the United States could no longer be a mediator in efforts to end Israeli-Palestinian conflict after its decision to recognize Israel as the capital of Israel.
From now on, it is out of the question for a biased United States to be a mediator between Israel and Palestine, that period is over, Erdogan told a news conference after a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul.
We need to discuss who will be a mediator from now on.
This needs to be tackled in the UN too, Erdogan said.
