brussels ( reuters ) - the well-preserved wreck of a world war one german submarine , possibly still containing the bodies of its 23 crew members , has been found off the belgian coast .
the use of submarines , often referred to as u-boats , in world war one to disrupt british trade routes in the english channel and the north sea was a key part of german tactics .
the 93 german u-boats stationed in belgian ports downed more than 2,500 ships but were also a target themselves , with 70 of them lost at sea , killing 1,200 sailors .
it was not yet clear which of the 11 known wrecks of the german submarines had been found , and authorities said they would not give the exact location of the wreck to deter looters .
of the 11 downed u-boats in belgian waters , this one is the best preserved example , the province of west flanders said .
belgium s north sea minister said he would investigate whether the wreck could be recognized as a heritage site .
