republicans might have congress and the white house , but they don t have the people or public opinion on their side , and it shows .
when house speaker paul ryan ( r-wi ) tried to attack the affordable care act on twitter today , he learned that the hard way.here s the tweet in question : retweet to agree # obamacare is failing .
we need to reverse the damage that has been done .

huh .
that s weird before obamacare , there was less choice , no central marketplace , insurance companies could reject you for preexisting conditions or set a lifetime cap on coverage , tens of millions weren t insured at all , and insurance companies could take as much profit as they wanted instead of spending on healthcare.however , little things like facts don t get in the way of the bloviating of bullshit artists like paul ryan .
luckily , twitter users instantly tore his lies apart : @ speakerryan when is your retweet to agree democracy is failing tweet dave levitan ( @ davelevitan ) february 5 , 2017 @ speakerryan trump is failing .

maloofs ( @ mmvarney ) february 5 , 2017this one sums it up perhaps best of all : @ speakerryan pic.twitter.com/jvi92thkt4 oh juliet ( @ justdreamin91 ) february 5 , 2017 @ speakerryan without replacement plan ; pure recklessness .
makes you look small minded , spiteful and uncaring # aca cmko ( @ hellocindy ) february 5 , 2017 @ speakerryan still all talk and no plan and most of us know it is not failing so stop with the lying rhetoric kathy pruitt ( @ kathypruitt54 ) february 5 , 2017is the aca perfect ?
no .
after all , insurance companies are still taking 20 percent of the money that could be spent entirely on healthcare .
however , republicans want to move in the opposite direction .
they re not out to help people at all .
that s why , instead of developing a reasonable alternative , they have spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars trying to repeal obamacare with no replacement .
and , now that they have power , they fully intend to do so and leave the american people stranded without a fallback.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images
