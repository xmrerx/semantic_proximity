Donald Trump thinks his apology was a great success, and he just got owned on Twitter for it.During a speech in North Carolina on Thursday, the Republican nominee claimed to regret some of the things he has said during his campaign.
Sometimes, in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing.
I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain.
Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.
But, this is Donald Trump, so of course he backtracked on that moments later.
In this journey, I will never lie to you.
I will never tell you something I do not believe myself.
I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours.
Trump then took to Twitter to tout his speech as a great success.
The reporting at the failing @nytimes gets worse and worse by the day.
Fortunately, it is a dying newspaper.

Another pitiful attempt to alter the optics of this disgraceful campaign.
After once again shuffling the staff, of course.
