If you ve ever been on Twitter then you know that with how great it is to get and receive information and updates as they happen, with the good comes the bad.
The very, very bad.One person who has recently encountered some of the bad is actress and activist Olivia Wilde.
She s a huge supporter of equal rights for women and minorities, and stands up frequently against police brutality.
However, she recently learned a pretty harsh truth about some of her Twitter followers.First, Wilde tweeted out how important it is to stop Donald Trump and make sure more women get into office:WOMEN CAN STOP TRUMP.

Or Trump.

That s a pretty safe bet.
And Wilde unfortunately learned the truth of that the hard way.
Good on her, though, for telling it like it is!Featured Photo by Donald Bowers/Getty Images for RYOT Twitter
