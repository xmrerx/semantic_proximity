juba ( reuters ) - the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) said on saturday one of its drivers was shot dead when a convoy of their vehicles was ambushed in south sudan s western equatoria state .
the icrc said lukudu kennedy laki emmanuel was killed when the convoy of nine trucks and a four-wheel-drive vehicle was shot at by unidentified gunmen while returning from western equatoria on friday .
we are shaken and distraught by the killing of our colleague who was traveling in a convoy of vehicles which were clearly marked with the red cross emblem , fran ois stamm , icrc s head of delegation in juba , said in a statement .
the western equatoria region borders central african republic and the democratic republic of congo .
south sudan became independent from neighboring sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict .
the new nation slid into civil war less than two years later , after president salva kiir fired his deputy , riek machar .
the conflict has often followed along ethnic lines , killing tens of thousands and forcing nearly a third of the population of 12 million to flee their homes , with uganda alone hosting 1 million south sudanese refugees .
south sudan also continues to be one of the most dangerous places for aid workers .
since the conflict began in december 2013 , at least 82 aid workers have been killed , including 17 in 2017 - most of them south sudanese , according to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ( un ocha ) .
since january , 27 security-related incidents have forced the relocation of some 300 aid workers .
these incidents signify a worsening operating environment for humanitarians in south sudan , the un ocha said in a statement on friday .
