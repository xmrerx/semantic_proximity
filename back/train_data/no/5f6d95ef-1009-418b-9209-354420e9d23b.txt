this isn t going to end well for germany a hospital in sigmaringen , germany has been forced to hire security guards after numerous incidents in which migrants physically attacked nurses while they were receiving free healthcare.schw bische.de reports that the srh hospital in sigmaringen took the precaution after 40 attacks on nurses in september alone , with nursing manager silvia st rk revealing that staff were totally distressed by the onslaught of verbal and physical abuse .
st rk said that refugees were biting and spitting at nurses , with drunk migrants behaving particularly aggressively towards female nurses during night time hours .
whenever a nurse working in the emergency room alone , she is accompanied by a security guard , according to the report , which states that nurses are accompanied by the guards between the hours of midnight and 6am from sundays to thursdays and from 10pm-6am on fridays and saturdays.according to manager willi rompp , despite the introduction of the security guards , attacks on the nurses have not decreased .
the hospital is bearing the full brunt of the cost to hire the security guards.as the gatestone institute recently highlighted , attacks by migrants are not the only strain currently being put on the german healthcare system as a result of the refugee influx .
hospitals , clinics and emergency rooms across germany are being filled to capacity with migrants suffering maladies of all kinds , and medical personnel , including thousands of volunteers , are increasingly complaining of burnout , according to the report .
diseases that have not been seen in germany for decades are also being brought into the country by asylum seekers .
some of the ailments i have not seen for 20 or 25 years , and many of my younger colleagues have actually never seen them , said dr. michael melter , the chief physician at the university hospital regensburg.the cost of holding migrants in quarantine when they arrive with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis is also astronomical , with german taxpayers footing a 12,000 euro bill per migrant , per month .
