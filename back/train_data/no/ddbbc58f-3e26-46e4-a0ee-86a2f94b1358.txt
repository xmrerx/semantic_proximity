belfast ( reuters ) - a senior member of northern ireland s democratic unionist party on wednesday blamed rivals sinn fein for the collapse of talks on forming a power-sharing government and suggested the dup would not compromise on the key issue of the irish language .
in the first public statement from the dup on the collapse of talks , member of parliament gregory campbell accused sinn fein of holding back government with a narrow political agenda .
campbell suggested that the dup would not accept sinn fein demands for additional rights and funding for irish language speakers , the key sticking point in talks in recent weeks , saying it already receives ample public funding .
we can not and will not be party to an agreement that elevates the irish language not only above all others , but above health , education and other vital public services , he said .
