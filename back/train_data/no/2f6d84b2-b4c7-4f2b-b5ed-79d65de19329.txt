sarajevo ( reuters ) - a bosnian serb man was arrested after trying to sell an original document from the 1995 dayton peace agreement that ended bosnia s war , police said on wednesday .
the document had gone missing a decade ago .
media identified the man as zeljko kuntos , a former driver for a bosnian serb ex-parliament speaker , and said he had been trying to sell the document for 100,000 bosnian marka ( $ 60,000 ) .
the u.s.-brokered peace treaty that ended the war was reached at a u.s. air base in dayton , ohio in november 1995 by the then presidents of bosnia , serbia and croatia , the three sides involved in the conflict in which more than 100,000 died .
under the treaty , bosnia was split into two autonomous regions , the federation shared by the bosnian croats and muslim bosniaks , and the serb-dominated serb republic .
the person z.k. , who obtained during 2017 the original document written in english of the dayton peace agreement , is suspected of offering it for sale in order to gain illegal benefits , police said in a statement .
they gave no further details .
in 2008 , a then presidency member revealed that the original document of the peace treaty in english was missing .
kuntos was arrested on thursday in pale , the bosnian serb wartime stronghold near sarajevo .
it is not clear how he obtained the document .
