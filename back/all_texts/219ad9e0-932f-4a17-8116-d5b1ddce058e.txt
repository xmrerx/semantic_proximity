Once again, the comedic geniuses at Saturday Night Live proved their prowess when they lambasted the embarrassing quagmire of bullsh*t, hysteria, and jingoistic, nonsensical willful ignorance that was the first GOP debate of 2016.
As always, Republicans failed to present a single workable idea at bettering our nation, but they did provide some downright hilarious soundbytes like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump s hilarious attempts to out- birther one another, or Carson s paranoid claims that ISIS hackers will down our electrical grid (even though squirrels are actually a bigger threat than any hacker).The SNL cast poked fun at Lindsey Graham s departure from the race (yes, we assure you he was running for President), Chris Christie s almost unredeemable unpopularity and terrible temper, Ted Cruz s supposed ineligibility for office (Let s face it he s eligible, just awful), Christie s nonsensical desire to kick Obama out of the White House (which he will be leaving of his own accord next January no matter what), Jebrah Bush s stupid Clinton joke, and other hits from the real embarrassment to America that was the debate.
They even translated Ted Cruz s New York values remark for us.Sure, we can laugh, but when you think about it one of the men who mainstaged the debate has an almost barely perceptible yet present chance of becoming the next President if Democrats don t get out and vote.
Look what the GOP accomplished in 2014, after all.As you watch this, consider that the SNL cast didn t have to reach very far for their jokes most of them were almost directly written by the Republicans extensive cast of bigots, hatemongers, and monumental imbeciles from the 2016 field.For now, of course, we ll just laugh and hope the joke doesn t become too real.Watch the hilarious video below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzysfuve9XM&w=420&h=315]Featured image via screengrab
