Ivanka Trump enjoys what someone from that family would consider the finer things in life: vacationing with a Russian dictator s rumored girlfriend, taking creepy and inappropriate photos with daddy, probably f*cking the 2016 GOP nominee (seriously), and Lady Grey brand ear cuffs, apparently.
Unfortunately for her, Lady Grey doesn t much like her.Trump ordered a gold-plated ear cuff, a piece of jewelry that makes it appear that the wearer gets fashion tips directly from Xena the warrior princess, from the popular indie brand.
Upon receipt of Ivanka s order for the $84 ear shield, the company worked diligently to fulfill the order, even including a special little gift for The Donald s daughter: a classy handwritten note from the company s founders.
Dear @ivankatrump, #thanksbutnothanks #payitFORWARD A photo posted by Lady Grey Jewelry (@ladygreyjewelry) on Aug 16, 2016 at 12:15pm PDT Dear Ivanka, Thank you so much for your web order!
the note begins.
Then it quickly turns biting: We re happy to let you know that the proceeds of your sale have been generously donated to the American Immigration Council, the Everytown for Gun Safety organization, and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
We hope you enjoy your new Lady Grey #helixearcuff.
Best, Jill + Sabine.
The note was included in her package and shipped last week directly from our studio in Brooklyn., Martinelli told The Cut.
While we were flattered to receive an order from Ivanka Trump, our social and political views couldn t be further from those of the Trump campaign.
When we received her order, we instantly felt compelled to take the money and donate it to a few organizations that were more aligned with our ideals.
Hopefully, Ivanka enjoys her piece of ear jewelry.
We re sure Everytown and the American Immigration Council are happy with the money.Featured image via Instagram/Getty Images(Jeff J. Mitchell)
