BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany said on Friday it condemned North Korea s latest missile test in the strongest terms.
North Korea fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean earlier on Friday, South Korean and Japanese officials said, deepening tension after Pyongyang s recent test of its most powerful nuclear bomb.
The government condemns the latest missile test from North Korea in the strongest terms, a government spokesman told a regular government news conference.
