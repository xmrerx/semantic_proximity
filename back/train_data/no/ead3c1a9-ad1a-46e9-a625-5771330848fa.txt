hillary s going to make make our borders less secure .
she s going to take away our ability to defend ourselves it s radical islam obama say it !
a gay man has made a riveting youtube video urging the gay community to vote for donald trump over hillary clinton in the aftermath of the orlando nightclub terrorist attack by an islamic state sympathizer .
the sleeping giant , a youtube user who describes himself a disaffected former liberal who just so happens to be gay , made an emotional appeal for trump in the video : hillary clinton is up there talking about guns .
and i just wanted to pull my hair out of my head in frustration because this isn t about guns .
if he [ omar mateen ] didn t have a gun then maybe it would have been a bomb .
it could have been arson .
it could have been any number of tools to kill people because it s not about the tool .
it s about terrorism .
it s about radical islam .
and we need to say it .
because if we can t even say it then how are we going to fight it ? in november , we have two options .
you may not like either of them .
a lot of people don t. you have hillary clinton and you have donald trump .
and all i can say right now is that hillary clinton is politicizing this and talking about gun control .
and donald trump , for all his faults , has the courage to stand up and call it what it is .
radical islam .
it is terrorism .
they re killing us , you guys .
they re killing us.i want him to fight them .
i want them to pay .
and i m not ashamed to say it that i want revenge.via : breitbart news
