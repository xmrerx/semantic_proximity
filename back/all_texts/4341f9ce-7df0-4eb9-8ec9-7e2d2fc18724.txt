Ordinarily, it s not cool to go after a presidential candidate s family, but seeing as Ivanka Trump, daughter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, is so active within the campaign, sorry, this is totally fair game.Ivanka, taking to both Twitter and Instagram to presumably share one of her favorite quotes with the many who follow her, posted: If not me, who?
If not now, when?
Which, ordinarily, is quite apropos for a person to post especially during a presidential campaign despite whether you think it s accurate or not.There s one big problem, however, she credited the quote not to its originator Hillel the Elder, an extremely important person in Jewish history, but rather to Harry Potter star Emma Watson.See more #ITwisewords: https://t.co/KzEUXBsXFb #quote #inspiration pic.twitter.com/mWFdLSxaL3 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) September 9, 2016Watson, who is also notably a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, used the quote in her famous speech from 2014.
She said: In my nervousness for this speech and in my moments of doubt I ve told myself firmly if not me, who, if not now, when.
If you have similar doubts when opportunities are presented to you I hope those words might be helpful.
Reactions surrounding Ivanka using this quote have included:Uh, @ivankatrump, as an Orthodox Jew, you should know this was not coined by Emma Watson:https://t.co/E9OrLut4ON pic.twitter.com/u72ShIoVaY (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) September 9, 2016This is what happens when you let Melania's speechwriter run your Instagram account https://t.co/Z9qwHxmyEs (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) September 9, 2016And every passover, we eat the Emma Watson sandwich https://t.co/pENUzrZv7F Kiera Feldman (@kierafeldman) September 9, 2016Heh: Girl that s from Hillel.
The craziness here is intensified by the fact that Ivanka s Jewish.
