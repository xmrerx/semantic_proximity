london s muslim mayor sadiq khan , called on the british government today to cancel their visit with president donald trump .
speaking to channel 4 news , khan felt trump s out-of-context criticisms and continued attacks on twitter meant that the u.k. should not roll out the red carpet for the president as his policies go against everything we stand for .
he added : when you have a special relationship it is no different from when you have got a close mate .
you stand with them in times of adversity but you call them out when they are wrong .
there are many things about which donald trump is wrong .
hollywood reportershouldn t london s government be more concerned with their current mayor s past than of president trump s efforts to unify the world in the fight against extreme islamic terrorism ? in 2016 , the now mayor of london , sadiq khan was branded unfit to be london s mayor after it emerged that he had described moderate muslim groups as uncle toms a notorious racial slur used against black people to suggest that they are subservient to whites.the incendiary claim emerged in a 2009 interview with iranian-backed press tv , when mr khan was minister for community cohesion , in charge of government efforts to stamp out extremism.the revelation is a major blow for mr khan , who has faced a string of claims about his past dealings with muslim extremists during the bitter campaign to succeed boris johnson .
