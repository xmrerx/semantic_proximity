paris ( reuters ) - france said on thursday it was paying close attention to evidence from a u.n. investigation that shows syrian forces used chemical weapons in different attacks in 2017 and before .
french president emmanuel macron said in may , barely two weeks after his inauguration , that the use of chemical weapons in syria would represent a red line and result in reprisals .
u.n. war crimes investigators said on wednesday that syrian forces have used chemical weapons more than two dozen times during the country s six-year civil war , including a deadly attack that led to u.s. air strikes on government planes .
syrian government forces carried out chemical attacks seven times between march 1 and july 7 , according to the u.n. investigation , suggesting attacks would have taken place after macron s warnings .
we are paying extremely close attention to the consistent evidence revealed by the commission regarding different types of chemical attacks on 2017 , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said in response to a question on what paris would do if its red line had been crossed .
she said the foreign ministry called for those behind the april 4 sarin attack on khan sheikhoun in idlib province , which killed more than 80 civilians , to be held to account .
