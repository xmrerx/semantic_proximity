moscow ( reuters ) - russia said on wednesday it had critically injured a leader of the tahrir al-sham militant group in syria with an air strike on his position that also killed 12 of his field commanders .
russia had targeted abu mohamad al-golani in an intelligence-led special operation while he was meeting his field commanders , the defence ministry said in a statement .
a statement by the militant group on its telegram channel denied the claim and said golani was in good health and exercising the duties assigned to him completely .
may god help him succeed in his task , the short statement said .
golani and his men were bombed by two russian planes on oct. 3 , according to a statement by defence ministry spokesman igor konashenkov .
the militant leader , who was the head of the nusra front before it merged with other groups to form tahrir al-sham , was badly hurt , the statement said .
as a result of the strike , the nusra front leader , abu mohamad al-golani , sustained numerous shrapnel wounds and , having lost an arm , is in a critical condition , according to information from several independent sources , konashenkov said .
nusra front severed ties with al qaeda last year and rebranded to head the hayat tahrir al-sham alliance .
other militants , along with golani , occupy roles in its high command .
around 50 of golani s bodyguards and 12 nusra front field commanders were killed in the same air strike , konashenkov said .
they included a close aide to golani and the head of the militant group s security service .
the ministry said the air strike was part of an ongoing operation to destroy militants who had launched an offensive on sept. 18 .
they surrounded 29 russian military policemen who then had to be broken out in an operation backed by air power .
