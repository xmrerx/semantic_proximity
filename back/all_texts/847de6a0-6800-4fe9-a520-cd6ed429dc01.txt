NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenyan election board should include Ekuru Aukot, who polled less than 1 percent in presidential elections in August, on the ballot in the event of a re-run, the High Court ruled on Wednesday.
I find nothing to bar the petitioner from contesting the fresh election, said Justice John Mativo.
His ruling means President Uhuru Kenyatta may still have a challenger on Oct. 26, when the re-run is scheduled, despite the withdrawal of top opposition candidate on Raila Odinga over allegations of bias.
