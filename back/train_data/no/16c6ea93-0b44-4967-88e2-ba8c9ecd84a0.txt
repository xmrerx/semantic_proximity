this is beyond unpresidential.during a narcissistic tweetstorm on sunday morning .
donald trump retweeted a video featuring him driving a golf ball into hillary clinton s back .
the ball knocks her down as she boards a plane .
the person who shared the meme captioned it trump s amazing golf swing and referred to hillary with the nickname crooked hillary that trump often calls her.donald trump s amazing golf swing # crookedhillary pic.twitter.com/vkhxxfcbv1 mike ( @ fuctupmind ) september 14 , 2017trump literally just retweeted a video of himself committing violence against a woman .
purposely hitting someone with a golf ball is assault , and this video appears to be a threat.this is not something a so-called american president should be tweeting.but trump did it anyway and the backlash was swift and brutal.what a surprise mr grab them by the pussy retweeting a gif of violence against women .
