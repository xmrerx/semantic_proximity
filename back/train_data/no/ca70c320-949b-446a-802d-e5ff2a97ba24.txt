yes , we did say she s a harvard business school graduate .
just goes to show , you can t buy brains kiran gandhi , who has played drums for singer m.i.a .
and thievery corporation , decided to run the london marathon without a tampon .
gandhi let her blood flow freely to raise awareness about women who have no access to feminine products and to encourage women to not be embarrassed about their periods .
i ran the whole marathon with my period blood running down my legs , the 26-year-old wrote of the april race on her website.gandhi , a harvard business school graduate , wrote that she got her period the night before the big race and thought that a tampon would be uncomfortable while she ran .
but that isn t the only reason she decided to let it flow .
i ran with blood dripping down my legs for sisters who don t have access to tampons and sisters who , despite cramping and pain , hide it away and pretend like it doesn t exist .
she added : i ran to say , it does exist , and we overcome it every day .
after the race , she took photos with her family and friends , wearing her period-stained running pants proudly.gandhi tells people that she decided to run without a tampon to highlight the sentiment of period-shaming and the language surrounding women s menstrual cycles .
she wrote on her site that on the marathon course , sexism can be beaten .
if there s one way to transcend oppression , it s to run a marathon in whatever way you want , she wrote .
where the stigma of a woman s period is irrelevant , and we can re-write the rules as we choose .
