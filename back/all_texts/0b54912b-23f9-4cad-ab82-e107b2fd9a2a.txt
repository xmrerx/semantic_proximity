WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday he believes lawmakers could reach a short-term U.S. budget deal by Friday if President Donald Trump did not meddle in their talks with “poison pill” demands like funding for a border wall.
“I am hopeful that we can get a budget done,” Schumer said at a news conference.
“The only fly in the ointment is that the president is being a little heavy-handed, and mixing in and asking for things such as the (border) wall.” “So we’d ask him to let us do our work, not throw in some last-minute poison pills that could undo it and we could get this done.”
