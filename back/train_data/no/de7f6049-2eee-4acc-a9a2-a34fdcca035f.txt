the green criminals who re working on how to distribute your money to those in far away places had a splendid meal last night in paris .
could someone tell obama we re broke ? as working dinners go , president obama s meal monday night in paris with french president francois hollande , secretary of state john kerry and others wasn t too shabby.no cartons of takeout instead , the gang fueled up after a long day of climate talks at l ambroisie , the three-michelin-starred temple of gastronomie in the marais neighborhood.per the michelin guide , the ornately be-chandelier-ed dining room is known for incomparable classicism and an immortal feast for the senses .
perhaps worried that obama would create an international faux pas by ordering a burger or a margarita ( two of his faves ) , a reporter asked what he planned to eat .
obama was , appropriately , diplomatic : i will get recommendations from the president , he answered , nodding in hollande s direction.according to the ap , obama cracked a joke about the opulence of the setting .
don t break the chandelier , he warned as a reporter s microphone got just a little too close to the crystal .
you can t afford it .
