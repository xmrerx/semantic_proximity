Nobody can accuse the GOP of having it all together, but they are pretty good at having their press releases done ahead of time.
Unfortunately for them, tonight s announcement was about the Vice Presidential debate, declaring Mike Pence the winner, well before the debate even started.Check it out below it s really amazing that they can see into the future:This is at least one Dewey Defeats Truman moment for the GOP.
Back in 1948, the Chicago Tribune jumped the gun of the presidential election for that year and published that headline.
Anybody who knows anything at all about American history should know we never had a President Dewey and the Tribune has yet to live that gaffe down.The GOP, though, won t deal in facts tonight.
They ll declare Pence the winner even if he literally never says a single word.
Notice what they highlighted: The economy and Hillary s emails.
Tonight s debate started with presidential leadership, and what the VP must do with zero prep should the president become incapacitated.Pence did do every single thing he could to blame Hillary Clinton for weak foreign policy, including lying through his teeth about why we pulled our troops out of Iraq (he repeated the GOP line that Hillary chose to pull our troops out and ignored the fact that it was not our choice it was Iraq s choice).
However, he s probably gotten some training from Trump s people, who try and turn even the most unrelated, irrelevant subjects into something about Hillary.Vox decided to be charitable with their evaluation of the GOP s premature ejaculation press release, saying it could be placeholder text on their site.
But considering that they also said the other clear winner was Donald Trump, it s really, really hard to see this as anything other than what it is the GOP trying to control the narrative before anything even began.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images
