On it he describes how he likes to approach her from behind and put his hands on her.At other times he says he loves her, and that he should re-arrange his office to make it more private.Like many other conservative Republicans caught in these situations, Bentley identified himself with the family values movement on the conservative right.The 72-year-old Bentley, a Republican serving in his second term, repeatedly has touted his Christian faith and conservative family values to attract voters.
He long has served as a deacon at First Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa.
Bentley made national headlines in 2011 when, shortly after his inauguration, he said, Anybody here today who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their savior, I m telling you, you re not my brother and you re not my sister.
And I want to be your brother.
It s only matter of time before all of the family values GOP politicians are caught in some kind of sexual scandal or another.Featured image via Flickr
