Just imagine if Jeb s campaign as much imagination and energy into researching the devastating effect that giving 25 million illegal aliens amnesty will have on America .During an appearance at a Jon Huntsman / The Hill No Labels event, a female audience member named Lauren Batchelder played the role of a female antagonist toward candidate Donald Trump.However, Ms. Batchelder is not just an average audience member.
She s a paid political operative of the GOP and a paid staff member of Team Jeb Bush:Within minutes of her scripted performance at the event, the producers of CNN were quickly editing soundbites and framing a narrative.
That story was pushed into the media stream within hours.
CNN s Jeanne Moos was the delivery vehicle for the a hit piece.Here s the CNN narrative as presented yesterday:However, as previously noted, it didn t take long to discover that Lauren Batchelder was not just an ordinary audience member, she is actually a current staffer for Senator Kelly Ayotte and also working in New Hampshire on behalf of the Jeb Bush 2016 campaign.Batchelder s LinkedIn profile shows she is a Jeb Bush For President 2016 staffer.Given Senator Ayotte s position being pro-life, and contrasted against the framework of Ms. Batchelder s line of questioning being completely opposite of the boss(es) she is working for, it doesn t take long to figure out this was a planted Establishment GOPe hit job targeting Donald Trump.Of course, Ms Batchelder quickly began scrubbing her social media history trying to hide who she works for.
Almost all of her Twitter history is now deleted, but not before much of it was able to be captured.
Several other profiles remain available:Via: Conservative Treehouse
