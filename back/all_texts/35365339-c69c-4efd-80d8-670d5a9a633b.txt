Women, especially women in the public eye, are the constant victims of body policing.
We re too fat, we re too thin, our breasts are too small, too large, or too fake.
Comedian Amy Schumer is one woman who is the constant victim of such comments, specifically those regarding her weight.
Schumer may not be a skinny minny, but she is a strong, healthy, beautiful woman who is not ashamed of who she is or how she looks.
That never stopped hateful trolls from calling her fat, though.
Well, Schumer decided to take those trolls to task via Instagram in the most perfect way by posting a photo of herself in a swimsuit.The post was captioned: I meant to write good morning trolls!
I hope you find some joy in your lives today in a human interaction and not just in writing unkind things to a stranger you ve never met who triggers something in you that makes you feel powerless and alone.
This is how I look.
I feel happy.
I think I look strong and healthy and also like miss trunchbull from Matilda.
Kisses!

The world is so unkind to those who are not a size 0, and that is nothing short of shameful.Amy Schumer is an excellent role model for women and girls and how we should deal with people who think they have the right to constantly comment on our bodies.Well done!Featured image via Brian Bedder/Getty Images
