What s not to love about this?
One of the greatest pro golfers ever is on the Trump Train!
Jack Nicklaus knows Donald Trump and had this to say about him: Actually, Donald s terrific isn t it so true that the greatest Americans have come out in support of Donald Trump?
Doesn t that tell you so much about him?
If people like Jack Nicklaus are vouching for Trump then who cares about RINO Paul Ryan s endorsement?In an interview with Jim Axelrod scheduled to air Sunday at 9 a.m. on CBS Sunday Morning, eighteen-time major winner Jack Nicklaus said he is supporting Donald Trump for President.
Actually, Donald s terrific, Nicklaus said.
I ve done several things with Donald.
Golf courses.
And he has absolutely treated me great.
