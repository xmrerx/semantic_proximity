christians don t decapitate their bosses well , you can t argue with that logic maybe they ll re-think their open-minded decision post-radical islam massacre on thursday the administrative tribunal of grenoble suspended a judgement of the municipality of charvieu-chavagneux , in is re , which said it only wanted to accept christian refugees because they don t decapitate their bosses .
the judgement was pronounced after a request for summary suspension filed by the prefecture of is re , the latter declared in a statement.the prefect initially asked the mayor to withdraw his judgement then initiated legal action when he refused to comply with his request .
the charvieu-chavagneux judgement seems to me to be liable to a double criticism on the basis of discrimination and the infringement of equality .
in this judgement approved unanimously by the municipal council on 8 september , charvieu-chavagneux town council said it wanted to mitigate the irresponsible foreign policy of the state by welcoming a family of refugees , on the express condition that it is a christian family .
the municpality explained its choice by declaring that christians don t jeopardise the security of anyone else , they don t attack trains armed with kalashnikovs , they don t shoot journalists in editorial meetings and they don t decapitate their bosses as we saw happen only a few kilometres away from our town .
