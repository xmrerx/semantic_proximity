seoul ( reuters ) - south korea is considering scrapping a regular military exercise with u.s. forces next year to minimize the risk of an aggressive north korean reaction during the winter olympics in the south , the yonhap news agency reported on thursday .
north korea denounces regular military exercises between south korean and u.s. forces as preparations to invade it , and it has at times conducted missile tests or taken other aggressive action in response .
the winter olympics will be held in south korea from feb. 9 to feb. 25 , with the paralympics on march 8-18 .
the south s yonhap news agency , citing an unidentified south korean presidential office official , said the option of scrapping the exercise had been considered for a very long time .
the blue house presidential office said in a statement no decision has been made on the exercise .
officials at the defense ministry declined to comment .
the south korean and u.s. militaries usually hold a military exercise in march and april called key resolve and foal eagle , which involves about 17,000 u.s. troops and more than 300,000 south koreans .
south korea is hopeful that north korean participation in the games could help improve their fraught relations .
the south has said any north korean athletes who are eligible for the competition would be welcome .
a north korean figure skating pair has qualified to compete but their participation has not been confirmed .
tension on the korean peninsula has been high for the past year with north korea developing its nuclear weapons and missiles in defiance of international condemnation and u.n. sanctions .
while north korea has not conducted any tests over the past two months , it has repeatedly vowed to never give up the weapons it deems it needs to protect itself against what it sees as u.s. aggression .
