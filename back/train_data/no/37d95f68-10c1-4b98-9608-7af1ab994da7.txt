this is a must watch from start to finish .
there has never been a leftist who can defeat the brilliant dinesh d souza in a debate .
he is a gift to conservatism and if we are ever going to win the war against the left , it is in everyone s best interest to listen to what this brilliant man has to say and learn how to turn the argument back on these faux moralists .
the best part of the discussion between this leftist amherst student and dinesh d souza comes at the 5:40 mark and again at the 10:15 mark : history is very complicated .
let me give you an example of india , so we can look at this at the level of theory .
india was invaded by the british , and earlier by the afghans , and the persians and the mongols .
so you have all these successive invasions .
right ?
are you actually saying that you believe in a rule of social justice today , that says globally lets look at this as a global rule of justice i m gon na figure out whose ancestors did what to whom and i m going to return goods that were illicitly taken from the beginning , to the people who had it originally .
do you believe that s a viable way to organize our society ?
do you believe , if i can ask you a direct question , that you are the benefit of white privilege here at amherst ?
the rest is pure gold since you are an acknowledged beneficiary of illicit white privilege .
would you be willing to step aside , voluntarily , putting your own moral mouth where your self-proclaimed virtue is , and give your seat , your seat , not my seat , i realize you may be super generous with other people s advantages and favor affirmative action so other white kids who apply to amherst are turned away to open spaces for minorities .
but i m not talking about you acting out you acting out your virtue on them .
i m talking about you acting out your virtue on you .
are you willing to give up your illicit seat , that you don t deserve here at amherst to make room for a disadvantaged minority ?
yes or no ?
