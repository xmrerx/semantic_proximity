How many of these punks treating police officers with disrespect will be the first to call them when they need help?A Minnesota sandwich shop worker should have thought twice before refusing to serve a police officer his lunch.The problem started Thursday when Edina Police Officer Marcus Limbeck went to a the Bloomington Jimmy John s restaurant and was confronted in the parking lot by an angry delivery driver who told him they would not serve him because the police ticket too many of the company s drivers, Fox 9 reported.Officer Limbeck emailed some other officers to tell them of his experience with the unruly driver, according to Fox 9.Edina patrol officer, Marcus Limbeck told his fellow officers in an e-mail the delivery driver yelled at him in the parking lot, you coming down here to give us tickets now?
inside, the same driver told him, you re not getting a sandwich here.
you ve given almost everybody here a ticket.
go get your sandwich someplace else.
The officer says the other workers were just laughing and snickering.
Customers were in disbelief that they actually refused to serve the officer.
But the story has a happy ending for the cops, if not for the employee.
The comments were so egregious we terminated the employee immediatel, the franchise owner Dan Vansteenburg told Fox 9.
We have a lot of respect for law enforcement.
We are a law-abiding sandwich shop, but we are on the road and we deliver sandwiches.
Vansteenburg also said he s like to treat all Edina officers to free sandwiches or make a special donation to make up for it.According to Fox 9 Edina does write more tickets than any town in Minnesota but it also have one of the state s lowest accident fatality rates.Via: BizPac Review
