The man who took the video, Corey Hour, described the event in a series of tweets: So, 10 minutes before take off a passenger starts a huge fight in his row.

They did the best they could to diffuse the situation.
Corey Hour (@CoreyHour) May 2, 2017The video ended when I stepped in & confronted the man in the red shirt.
I told him to leave and squared up with him, he backed down n left.
Corey Hour (@CoreyHour) May 2, 2017As of now and after speaking with the other passengers the motive for why he did this is still UNKNOWN.
None of us have any idea why at all.
Corey Hour (@CoreyHour) May 2, 2017According to LADbible, who published the video, The man in the shirt was subsequently arrested for assault and public intoxication at the airport in Japan.
Seeing as they re both wearing shirts, they likely meant the guy with the torn shirt who was escorted off the plane.What is happening with people right now, more than usual, that they think violence is the answer to all their problems?
Who does this?
