berlin ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel s christian democrats ( cdu ) have agreed on the divisive issue of a refugee cap with her conservative bavarian allies , two conservative sources told reuters , removing a hurdle to coalition talks with other parties .
the agreement came on sunday evening after leading members of the cdu held talks with the christian social union ( csu ) .
merkel aims to build a nationally untested coalition between her conservative bloc , the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) and greens after winning a fourth term as chancellor in a sept. 24 election but losing much support to the far-right .
