Bill O Reilly has said some ridiculous things on his show over the years and his so-called conservatism has translated into outright bigotry and nonsense in many cases.
That tradition continued with yet another nonsensical statement, this time about women.
Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za05IPc8F-U]It all started with O Reilly s interpretation of what Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton said during the Democratic debates on the issue of abortion, believing that both candidates say they want few limits on abortion.
During an interview with Fox News analyst Kirsten Powers, O Reilly said: If you are going to say that the two Democrats running for president both favor pretty much abortion at any time, for any reason, and they hide behind the women s health issue, but that could be a migraine headache, you know.
OK, I don t want to have the kid, my boyfriend left me, my husband left me, whatever it may be, I got a migraine, kid is going to be born next week.
Let s get- Powers interrupted, saying, I don t think that many people get abortions because they have a migraine headache.
O Reilly continued: OK, it doesn t matter.
It s theoretical.
When you have two candidates saying they don t want any limitations in the law place, they don t want any.
That can happen.
And we know what happened in Kansas, did that big investigation on Tiller you know what happened there.
And so that s so radical and so far away from what the American people want.
That s just one example.
O Reilly has proven himself to lack any credibility whatsoever and his male privilege is disturbing to watch.
When will people learn that a woman has a right to choose?
After all, in the end, it s the woman s body and O Reilly s nonsense is typical of males believing they have authority over a woman s body as well as her choices.I m looking forward to the day when this guy s show gets cancelled.Featured image via video screenshot.
