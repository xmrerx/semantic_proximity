moscow ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin said on thursday that spymania had been artificially whipped up between russia and the united states , and that eventually relations between the two countries would get back to normal .
he said that contacts between russian officials and members of u.s. president donald trump s team during his election campaign had been routine , but had been twisted by trump s opponents .
