I watched this exchange last night and couldn t believe the insanity seriously.
It was curfew and the people in the streets ignored it which is crazy in itself but then Geraldo shows up.
He almost comes to blows with rioters and is screamed at.
One rioter said, Stop making money off of black pain.
The part of all this that s maddening is this woman s excuse that the media was causing these people to be angry.
The City Council woman continued to make excuses for these bad actors and blamed the messenger.
Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Yes, this is the common theme from the left and I believe most Americans are 100% FED Up!
with it.
