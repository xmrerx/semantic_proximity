ABC political hack Martha Raddatz tried to bait Homeland Security Adviser Thomas Bossert when she played the CNN WWE video and commented that it seems like a threat .
Bossert didn t take the bait but praised President Trump for standing up to the media.
Great job!NEW: Homeland Security Adviser Thomas Bossert on Trump s CNN tweet: No one would perceive that as a threat.
I hope they don t. #ThisWeek pic.twitter.com/BfrWWt7buM This Week (@ThisWeekABC) July 2, 2017The DHS adviser responded: No one would perceive that as a threat.
I hope they don t. I do think that he s beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to.He went on to praise President Trump: the most genuine president and the most non-politician president we ve seen in my lifetime.
There s a lot of cable new shows that reach directly into hundreds of thousands of viewers and they re really not all very fair to the president.
So I m pretty proud of the president for developing a Twitter and a social media platform where he can talk directly to the American people.
