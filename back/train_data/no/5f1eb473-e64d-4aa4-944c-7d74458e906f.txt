phnom penh ( reuters ) - cambodia could make more arrests of people linked to a plot to overthrow the government , prime minister hun sen said on monday , attacking opposition figures as rebels in the city bent on staging a color revolution , despite past failures .
the comment is part of the strongman s widening crackdown on opposition politicians and independent media that critics and rights groups see as an effort to shore up his party s strength ahead of a general election next year .
last month , authorities arrested kem sokha , leader of the opposition cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) , and charged him with treason and espionage over an alleged plot to take power with help from the united states .
the u.s. embassy has rejected any suggestion of interference in politics .
the sept. 3 arrest sparked condemnation from western countries , and the cnrp has said about half its members of parliament have fled cambodia fearing a crackdown by hun sen .
this isn t over yet with one arrest , i would like to send out a message , hun sen , who has ruled cambodia for more than 30 years , said at an opening ceremony for a hotel in siem reap province .
this set-up is a systematic activity , he added , referring to the alleged opposition plot to overthrow his government .
the rebels in the city that do color revolution are absolutely rejected .
hun sen can claim support from his main ally , china , which has said it supports cambodia s efforts to maintain its security .
the government says a 2013 video in which kem sokha tells supporters he has help from unidentified americans to gain power is evidence that he was colluding with the united states .
the opposition argues the video is evidence of an election strategy , not a coup plot .
