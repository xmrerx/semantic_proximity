amsterdam ( reuters ) - the international criminal court approved a prosecution request on thursday to investigate war crimes allegedly committed in burundi by the government and government-linked groups against political foes from april 2015 to october 2017 .
the decision follows burundi s decision to withdraw from the court as of oct. 26 , 2017 .
however , the court will still have jurisdiction over crimes committed while burundi was a member .
a court statement said the country s government launched a widespread and systematic attack against the burundian civilian population ... targeting those who opposed or were perceived to oppose the ruling party .
in a statement , the court said the prosecutor had presented enough evidence of crimes against humanity to merit a formal investigation , including murder , torture , rape and persecution , that led to more than 1,000 deaths .
unrest has gripped burundi since the announcement , in april 2015 , that president pierre nkurunziza would seek a third term in office .
he won in july of that year , despite protests that the vote was rigged and that his seeking a third term violated both the constitution and the terms of an agreement that had ended a previous rebellion .
un rights investigators and independent activists have accused government forces of widespread violations , including forced disappearances , and of orchestrating a campaign of terror .
around 400,000 people have fled to neighboring countries amid the unrest , which has crippled burundi s economy .
reacting to the court decision , top nkurunziza adviser willy nyamitwe tweeted : the corrupt icc just shot itself in the foot .
this is obviously cheating , but no doubt burundi will be the winner in this battle .
this is the last card of the western powers , he said .
