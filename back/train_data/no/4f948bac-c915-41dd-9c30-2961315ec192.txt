a bunch of thugs , a bunch of creeps , criminals , race hustlers with a scattering of law abiding people converged in this area and ripped the town up again .
i would ve like to think this phony ( # blacklivesmatter ) movement would ve come back to apologize to the good law-abiding people of ferguson , mo , but instead , we get this whole phony movement .
in the first round there was an over-reliance by the police on avoiding confrontation .
look , the police are not looking for confrontation , but if someone s gon na bring the fight , then they have to respond quickly .
if there s looting , if there s gun fire like last night , if there s rioting , if there s other sort of criminal behavior , law enforcement needs to use the resources they have .
respond quickly and crush it .
and give the impression to these individuals that this stuff is not gon na stand .
they re ( the left ) gon na keep this thing going and it s an unfortunate thing .
because look , this isn t selma , alabama this isn t montgomery , it isn t the civl rights movement .
mike brown was engaged in felonious conduct.this is a slap in the face to people like rosa parks and martin luther king , jr .
they oughta go back and study dr. martin luther king , jr .
i don t remember gun fire and rioting breaking out at a protest that he held .
