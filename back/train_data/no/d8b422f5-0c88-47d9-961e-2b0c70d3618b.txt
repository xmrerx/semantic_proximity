washington ( reuters ) - secretary of state rex tillerson said on tuesday that the united states was willing to begin direct talks with north korea without pre-conditions , appearing to back away from u.s. demands that pyongyang first accept that any negotiations would have to be based on north korean disarmament .
let s just meet , tillerson said in a speech to a washington think tank , offering a new diplomatic opening amid heightened tensions over north korea s weapons advances .
we can talk about the weather if you want .
we can talk about whether it s going to be a square table or a round table .
then we can begin to lay out a map , a road map , of what we might be willing to work towards , tillerson said , suggesting that any initial contacts would be about setting the ground rules for formal negotiations .
