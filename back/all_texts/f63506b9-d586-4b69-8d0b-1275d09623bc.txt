NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s police service said five people were killed by mobs on Friday for looting during unauthorized processions called to welcome opposition leader Raila Odinga back to the country after a trip abroad.
Reuters photographers had earlier counted two bodies with gunshot wounds sustained in the violence as police tried to disperse Odinga s supporters who walked alongside his convoy from the airport.
