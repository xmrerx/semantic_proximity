after watching the debate between all the republican candidates last night , it s very clear that the status quo from both political parties wants to bring the donald down .
cnn did everything in their power to discredit trump and bring the other candidates down in the process .
the only problem is the people of america see through the political bs and really don t care what the pundits think .
this is pretty refreshing and it s too bad the republican party isn t embracing broadening the base like mr. trump has done so well .
his support from viewers is evident in the poll numbers below : * we do not endorse candidates but we re 100 % fed up !
with both parties trying to decide the election for us .
we really don t like canned answers from candidates either .
* karl rove needs to take his white board and go away ! the people have spoken and the results are in on who the american people think is # 1 :
