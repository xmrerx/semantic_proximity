@ realdonaldtrump : - the failing @ nytimes , which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win ( apologized ) , is totally inept !
[ 0638 edt ] - the trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before ( despite some phony fake news polling ) .
look at rallies in penn , iowa , ohio ....... [ 0658 edt ] - ... and west virginia .
the fact is the fake news russian collusion story , record stock market , border security , military strength , jobs ..... [ 0704 edt ] - ... supreme court pick , economic enthusiasm , deregulation & so much more have driven the trump base even closer together .
will never change !
[ 0709 edt ] - hard to believe that with 24/7 # fake news on cnn , abc , nbc , cbs , nytimes & wapo , the trump base is getting stronger !
[ 0718 edt ] - working hard from new jersey while white house goes through long planned renovation .
going to new york next week for more meetings .
[ 0732 edt ] - interesting to watch senator richard blumenthal of connecticut talking about hoax russian collusion when he was a phony vietnam con artist !
[ 0747 edt ] - never in u.s.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like senator richard blumenthal .
he told stories about his vietnam battles and .... [ 0752 edt ] - ... conquests , how brave he was , and it was all a lie .
he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child .
now he judges collusion ?

# usa [ 1403 edt ] - the fake news media will not talk about the importance of the united nations security council â€™ s 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on n. korea !
[ 1615 edt ] - how much longer will the failing nytimes , with its big losses and massive unfunded liability ( and non-existent sources ) , remain in business ?
[ 1639 edt ] - i think senator blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in vietnam , where he lied about his service , so he can at least say he was there [ 1648 edt ] -- source link : ( bit.ly/2jbh4lu ) ( bit.ly/2jpexyr )
