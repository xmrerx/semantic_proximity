johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s deputy president cyril ramaphosa has taken a lead in party nominations for the next leader of the ruling african national congress ( anc ) , securing the support of 65 percent of branches tallied so far , a poll showed .
hundreds of anc branches across south africa are nominating their choice for party president and other senior positions ahead of a december conference where about 5,000 delegates sent by the branches will cast their votes .
the anc s next leader will probably become president of the country at a national election in 2019 given the party s electoral dominance .
early indications are that party members are split between ramaphosa , a former union leader and one of the country s richest people , and nkosazana dlamini-zuma , a former minister and ex-wife of president jacob zuma , for the party s top job .
the poll by the institute of race relations ( irr ) found that dlamini-zuma had secured 30 percent of nominations and that anc treasurer general zweli mkhize received most of the remaining 5 percent of nominations .
the irr said its data suggested 74 percent of anc branches had made nominations and cautioned that it had not been able to corroborate its findings .
the anc does not make the nomination tallies public .
a ramaphosa win in december has tended to be viewed as the more positive outcome by investors , some of whom have been spooked by dlamini-zuma s campaign message of radical wealth redistribution .
nominations do not necessarily translate into votes at the anc s elective conference because delegates could vote for a different candidate than the one nominated by their branch .
dlamini-zuma s campaign says that many branches sympathetic to her are yet to submit their nominations , which could reduce ramaphosa s lead or swing the outcome in december in her favor .
dlamini-zuma is backed by the anc s women s and youth leagues , which also vote in december .
