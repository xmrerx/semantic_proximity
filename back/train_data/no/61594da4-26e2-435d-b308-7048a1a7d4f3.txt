edinburgh ( reuters ) - scotland s devolved government issued an apology on tuesday to men convicted in the past for same-sex activity and passed a new law which will allow them to clear their names .
it is only right that we address this historic wrong , first minister nicola sturgeon told the scottish parliament .
discriminatory laws , although abolished , continue to have implications for people to this day , she added .
the wrong has been committed by the state to them , not by the individuals .
she added : i categorically , unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize for those laws and for the hurt and the harm they did to so many .
watching from the gallery , same-sex couples wept , held hands and applauded .
consensual homosexual acts between men aged over 21 in scotland were decriminalized in 1981 .
( the ) apology will give a great deal of comfort to many who were unjustly prosecuted and will help draw a line , once and for all , under a dark period in scotland s history , gay rights group stonewall said in a statement .
the legislation acknowledges the wrongfulness and discriminatory effect of past convictions for certain historical sexual offences by pardoning people convicted of those offences and providing a legal process for convictions to be disregarded .
in january , the uk government passed a similar law relating to england and wales .
