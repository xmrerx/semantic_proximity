washington ( reuters ) - u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday that the killing of former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh would , in the short term , likely worsen an already dire humanitarian situation in the country .
saleh was killed in a roadside attack on monday after switching sides in yemen s civil war , abandoning his iran-aligned houthi allies in favor of a saudi-led coalition .
coupled with a saudi-led blockade and internal clashes , the stalemate has contributed to a human catastrophe .
some 7 million people are on the brink of famine , while one million are suspected to be infected with cholera .
mattis , speaking with reporters on a military aircraft en route to washington after a brief trip to parts of the middle east and south asia , said it was too early to say what impact the killing would have on the war .
he said it could either push the conflict towards u.n. peace negotiations or make it an even more vicious war .
( but ) one thing i think i can say with a lot of concern and probably likelihood is that the situation for the innocent people there , the humanitarian side , is most likely to ( get ) worse in the short term , mattis said .
he did not explain his reasoning .
the war has already killed more than 10,000 and displaced millions .
so this is where we ve all got to roll up our sleeves .
now , what are you going to do about medicine and food and clean water and cholera , mattis said .
i think there has got to be a lot more focus on the humanitarian side right now .
analysts said saleh s death would be a huge moral boost for the houthis and a serious blow to the saudi-led coalition that intervened in the conflict to try to restore the internationally recognized government of president abd-rabbu mansour hadi .
saudi arabia and its allies receive logistical and intelligence help from the united states .
mattis said he did not believe the u.s. military would play a role in easing the humanitarian situation .
