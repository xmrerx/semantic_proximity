At this point in the presidential race, you ve either come to determine that Donald Trump is the person for you, because policy inexperience and racism are appealing for you, or you ve realized that Trump is a racist, misogynistic, egomaniacal ass.
And if anything can be shown by the polls that have shown Trump holding a huge lead over his competition, it s that the Republican base prefers bigotry and bombastic hyperbole or facts, figures, and a solid plan for the future.Trump being as he is, isn t exactly new either.
He s always been the narcissist that he actually, truly is.
He s always thought his ideas are perfect and his shit doesn t stink.
He s even gone so far as to compare a book he wrote to the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.Back in 2011, while pushing people to buy his latest batch of drivel, he made just that comparison:First there was the Declaration of Independence, then there was the Constitution.
Now there is #TimeToGetTough.
Available today.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2011His book Time to Get Tough also held a very familiar tagline: Making America #1 Again.
Trump honestly sees himself as a savior of sorts, a deity that will magically solve all the nations problems.
In comparing himself to the Founding Fathers he resorts to an emotion that those dumb enough to fall for the line, will see him as just as profound as those who sought to make freedom a national ideal and form a new nation.The thing is, he s no savior, nor is he anything like the Founding Fathers.
He s a narcissistic businessman out for himself and wants to see how far he can go.
Not for the nation, but for his own ego.
Just listen to any campaign rally, he s obsessed with polls numbers and will talk the entire time about how great he is, and spend next to zero time talking about any sort of plans or policy.America is already great, and if you want to keep it that way, make sure you vote blue this November.Featured image: Flickr/Twitter
