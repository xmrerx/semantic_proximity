madrid ( reuters ) - the spanish constitutional court has suspended a referendum law that was approved on wednesday by the catalan parliament , blocking the way for an oct. 1 ballot on independence from spain , a court source said on thursday .
the law will be suspended while judges consider arguments that the vote breaches the country s constitution .
prime minister mariano rajoy said earlier on thursday he had appealed to the court to declare the referendum illegal .
the constitution states spain is indivisible .
