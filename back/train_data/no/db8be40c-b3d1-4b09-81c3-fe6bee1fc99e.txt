london ( reuters ) - british foreign secretary boris johnson said on thursday it was time to ramp up the pace of brexit talks after the european union s chief negotiator said they were deadlocked over money .
we re looking for some urgency from our friends and partners , time to put a bit of a tiger in the tank and get this thing done , he told reporters .
we think ... that we ve made some very helpful suggestions to get the great ship moving down the slipway and on to the open seas , that is what we all want to see .
we see no reason why that should not take place .
brexit talks are deadlocked over money , the eu s michel barnier said on thursday as he ruled out discussions on future trade being launched by eu leaders next week but spoke of possible progress by december .
the prime minister has made it very , very clear that we are going to get a deal , we are working for a great deal , but obviously we must make the right preparations as and when it is necessary for a no-deal scenario , johnson said .
of course that s the responsible thing to do and that s what we are going to do .
