paris ( reuters ) - investigators on friday reconstructed the seconds before a train plowed into a school bus at a level crossing in southern france and killed at least five children , an incident the prime minister described as horrific .
the collision on thursday afternoon ripped the bus apart and authorities worked into the night to identify the first victims .
the official death toll came after a source close to the investigation earlier said six youngsters had lost their lives in an incident that stunned the small community of millas , near perpignan .
hospitals appealed for blood to help them treat seven others who remain in a critical condition .
government spokesman benjamin griveaux said the cause of the crash was still unclear .
it occurred at a crossing which was not considered dangerous .
investigators are looking into whether the automatic barriers and lights on the level crossing malfunctioned and have taken blood samples from the driver for toxicology studies , french media reported .
the driver , a 49-year-old woman who was injured in the collision , was described lucid by the manager of the bus company in an interview with bfm tv .
the bus was well maintained , he added .
the train was carrying 25 passengers and traveling at 80 kmh , the regulatory speed for the section of track where the collision occurred , the national sncf railway said .
