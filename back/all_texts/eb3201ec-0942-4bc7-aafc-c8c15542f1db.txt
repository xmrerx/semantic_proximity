President Trump was sporting a Commemorative Stetson hat today when he introduced the Made in America week starting with Omaha Steaks.
He has a great one-liner in the video below this one about opening the beef trade again with China: The gentleman who was in charge of Omaha Beef.
They do beef.
He hugged me and he wanted to kiss me so badly.
