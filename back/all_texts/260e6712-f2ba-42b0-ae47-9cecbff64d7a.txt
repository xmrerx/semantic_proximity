ALMATY (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan is in talks with Moscow about hosting a second Russian military base, Russian news agency RIA quoted Kyrgyz Prime Minister Sapar Isakov as saying on Monday.
During a visit last week to Moscow, Isakov suggested situating the base in the southern part of the Central Asian country close to its border with Tajikistan - where Russia also has a similar facility.
There is no final decision from either of the sides, RIA quoted him as saying in an interview.
Negotiations continue on this matter.
Close ally Kyrgyzstan already hosts a Russian airbase located near its capital, Bishkek.
