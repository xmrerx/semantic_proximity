Who likes Donald Trump?
Not Democrats.
Not women, young adults, Hispanics or independents, either.
Half of Republican voters don t even like him.According to a new poll conducted jointly by The Washington Post and ABC News, Donald Trump is unpopular with just about everyone in the country.In fact, The Washington Post reports that Trump has the worst favorability rating of any candidate in the survey s 32-year-long history.The poll shows that 67 percent of all voters view Trump unfavorably.Certain demographics like him less than others.
For example, 75 percent of women view him unfavorably.
Among young voters, 80 percent have an unfavorable view of the current Republican frontrunner.
Not surprisingly, Hispanic voters like Trump the least, with 85 percent having an unfavorable view.Half of all republican voters said they view Trump unfavorably.
What s more, just 20 percent of Republicans said they would oppose attempts to stop Trump from gaining the party s nomination.
More than twice as many, 43 percent, said they would support such an effort.While only 34 percent of republicans surveyed said they want to see Trump become president of the United States, that number is still higher than the number of voters who support challengers Ted Cruz or John Kasich.He may manage to gain the republican nomination, but Trump s very low favorability rating is not going to carry him through a general election.According to Real Clear Politics, both democratic candidates would defeat Donald Trump in the general election.Hillary Clinton leads Trump by 10.6 points, according to the site s general election matchup predictions.Clinton s democratic competitor, Bernie Sanders, leads Trump by an even larger margin nationally, with a 15.8 percentage point lead over the republican frontrunner.It s easy to see why republicans are willing to do just about anything to stop Trump from winning the party s nomination.Trump may poll favorably among a small portion of republican voters, but you can t win a general election when democrats, independents, women, Hispanic voters, young adults, even half of the people in your own party literally despise you.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images
