islamabad ( reuters ) - afghanistan , china , pakistan and the united states met in oman on monday to try to find ways of reviving peace talks with afghan taliban militants , two officials in pakistan s foreign ministry said .
but it was not clear if any afghan taliban had joined the talks , which have so far failed to restart a tentative process that collapsed in 2015 .
taliban sources had previously said they would stay away from the discussions in muscat , casting doubt on prospects for reviving long-stalled negotiations .
the pakistani officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information , said the talks had resumed on pakistan s initiative .
the pakistani team was led by foreign secretary tehmina janjua .
there was no immediate comment from the united states , china or afghanistan about the talks resuming .
the four-nation quadrilateral coordination group ( qgc ) , comprising afghanistan , china , pakistan and the united states , which last met in islamabad early last year , has been trying to ease the path to direct talks between the afghan government and the taliban , with little success .
amin waqad , a close aide to agfhan president ashraf ghani and a senior member of the high peace council ( hpc ) , said last week his country would participate in the muscat meeting , and that the taliban representatives would also be there .
the taliban denied that they had received any invitation .
efforts to kick-start negotiations have failed due to the taliban s refusal to attend talks after their last leader mullah akhtar mansur was killed in a u.s. drone strike in pakistan last year .
the united states wants pakistan , which it accuses of harbouring afghan taliban commanders , to exert more influence on the group to bring them to the negotiating table .
pakistani officials deny sheltering taliban militants and say their influence on the group has waned .
