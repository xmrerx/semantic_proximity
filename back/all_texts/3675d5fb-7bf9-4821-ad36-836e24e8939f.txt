The idea of there being a group of people who are gay and actively support the GOP is pretty ludicrous, considering the Republican Party is bigoted against LGBTQ people as a matter of practice and policy.
After all, their official 2016 party platform is easily the most anti-LGBTQ in history.
Nevertheless, the Log Cabin Republicans keep trucking on, trying to make people who will always hate them allow them into their club.Well, it seems even these morons have a line, as they ve decided that there will be no endorsement for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump from them.
This is most curious, considering that the group has said that Trump is the most pro-LGBTQ presidential nominee in the history of the party.
This is in no way true of course; after all, Trump picked Mike Pence as his running mate, and he is the man who rose to national prominence by signing a horribly bigoted law that effectively legalized discrimination against LGBTQ people in Indiana, the state he currently governs.
Here is what the Log Cabin folks had to say about Trump, and their decision not to endorse, even though he pandered to LGBTQ people, which they say is unprecedented for their party: But Log Cabin Republicans have long emphasized that we are not a single-issue organization, nor are our members single-issue voters.
Even if we were, rhetoric alone regarding LGBT issues does not equate to doctrine.As Mr. Trump spoke positively about the LGBT community in the United States, he concurrently surrounded himself with senior advisors with a record of opposing LGBT equality, and committed himself to supporting legislation such as the so-called First Amendment Defense Act that Log Cabin Republicans opposes.
Well, at least they showed a bit of backbone here, but it still boggles the mind that these idiots think that they re a part of the right political party.
Oh well, this is more than most people who look at the Log Cabin Republicans and shake their heads could ask for.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images
