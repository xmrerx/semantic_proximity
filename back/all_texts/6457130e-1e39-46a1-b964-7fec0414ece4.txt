Before Donald Trump pulled off winning the presidency (which no one saw coming), there were reports that the billionaire mogul was preparing to potentially launch a TV news network that would be even more outrageous than Fox News hence why he ran for president: he needed to build an audience.But now he s going to be President of the United States, so that won t be happening.However, there is one person who may be eyeing a career in media President Obama.According to multiple sources that spoke to Mic, President Obama is looking into launching a digital media company, and that media will be the focus of the next chapter of his life.Mic is also reporting albeit another anonymous source that President Obama and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg talked about the post-presidency prospects at a meeting in Lima, Peru during the APEC summit.White House communications director told Mic that the president (as of now) has no plans to get into the media industry:While the president will remain actively engaged in inspiring young people and he is interested in the changing ways people consume information, he has no plans to get into the media business after he leaves office.When Rolling Stone had asked President Obama what his post-presidential plans would entail, he gave the American people the first clue that could actually tie into a media launch against right-wing B.S.
:How do we rethink our storytelling, the messaging and the use of technology and digital media, so that we can make a persuasive case across the country?There s an easy answer to that question: Obama TV, or the Obama News Network.Now that the world is creeping up on a Trump presidency, who better to reach out and offer sanity to the public than President Obama, who has pledged he will not keep quiet on the sidelines.Having Bill O Reilly and the other right-wing blowhards like Tomi Lahren compete against President Obama and his people for ratings would be a marvelous sight to behold.With millennials constantly being turned off by the political process (and always on social media), a network launch from one of greatest presidents this country has ever seen may not be such a bad idea.
Perhaps Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert could come onboard.With Democrats taking over the conversation from the noise at Fox News, the possibilities are endless.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images
