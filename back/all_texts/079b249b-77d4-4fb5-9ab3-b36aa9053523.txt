It has been almost a week since over 20 armed gunmen occupied a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, demanding the land be returned to its rightful owners .
The Chair of the areas Native American tribe had something to say about that, and it s a mic drop.When chair of Burns Paiute tribe heard protestors would return land to its rightful owners, she joked she started writing acceptance letter Salvador Hernandez (@SalHernandez) January 6, 2016One of the armed gunmen, Ryan Payne, spoke to the New York Times on Tuesday, claiming that: the federal government unconstitutionally laid claim to land within the United States, and people who use and love the land ranchers, miners, and loggers, among others deserve to have it back.The 5.2 million Native American and Alaska Native s identified by the 2010 U.S. Census might be a little more familiar with this problem that the ammosexual occupiers of the Oregon reserve.An interactive map put together by the science and humanities magazine Aeon shows details the land grab of 1776 to 1887, during which the United States seized over 1.5 billion acres from America s indigenous people by treaty and executive order.The short video below shows the near total transfer of land from Native American tribes to the United States over that time frame.
On Wednesday of this week, the Burns Paiute Tribe, who s reservation is close to the armed occupation, called on the militia-men to leave.
The Chairwoman of the Burns Paiute Tribe, Charlotte Rodrique, told Reuters that the occupation was desecrating one of our sacred sites, I don t give much credence to their cause, she continued.
We never gave up our aboriginal rights to the territory, so we as a tribe actually view this as our land, no matter who is living on it, she said.
We were here first and just want to set the facts straight.
Her dignified message somewhat underscores the wanton belligerence of the Bundy militia, who the FBI confirm will face federal charges when their standoff comes to an end.
If the federal government owes any group some land, it s certainly not this sad bunch of angry white ammosexuals.
