Nancy Pelosi couldn t sink any lower than this.
She was doing a question and answer when she giggled and said she can t call Donald Trump president Trump.
The oddest behavior comes after the giggles.
She goes on to brag about her position in the Democrat Party and how she was so looking forward to Hillary s win.
It s quite a delusional rant.
How can the Democrats be taken seriously when they behave this way?
Pelosi isn t the only one.
Maxine Waters is a very close second in the wacky category.
See the video below this one where she goes ballistic on a woman who said I love my president .PELOSI GIGGLES LIKE A CHILD:MAXINE WATERS GOES BALLISTIC: The latest video of Maxine Waters is downright hysterical!
She s confronted by one of her constituents who says they re going to work every day to make sure that President Trump isn t impeached and that Waters is impeached.
Mad Max didn t care for that comment and shot back: You can t impeach a woman of Congress Constituent: Well I just want to talk about your representation in Washington and our President as well.Waters: I can t stand him!
He s the most horrible man I ve ever seen in my life!
Constituent: I love my President.
Waters: I m glad you do!
Your President is a dishonorable, lying man.
He mocked a journalist.
I ve never seen a grown man do that!
He talked about grabbing women by the private parts.
He s lies everyday.
He s in bed with Putin and the Russians about oil!
And everybody around him are allies with the Kremlin and with the Oligarchs of Russia.
They re gonna take us down!
NEW: Constituent confronts Maxine Waters: I m going to work every day to make sure that [Trump] isn t impeached and that you re impeached.
