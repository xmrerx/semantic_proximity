this is political correctness out of control !
what do these goofballs think we won the war with ?
hopefully , they come to their senses and go ahead with the memorial including the rifle.a milford , michigan , veterans group is up in arms after a proposal to place a memorial containing a battlefield cross a military helmet and dog tags atop a semiautomatic rifle mounted on boots was deemed too pro-violence by the local council.the battlefield cross dates back to civil war days as a stark reminder of the sacrifices of fallen soldiers.fox news reported bear hall , the chairman of the friends of american veterans in milford , wanted to place a sculpture of the iconic image at the end of a walkway to an existing veterans memorial .
but some on the local council deemed it inappropriate .
there was some concern from a couple of members regarding the specific memorial that s proposed .
specifically , the gun , said milford village manager christian wuerth , to the detroit free press .
they understood the history and meaning of it .
they just didn t feel it was appropriate for that specific location .
councilman tom nader was one who opposed the memorial .
being a veteran , i want to see a monument there , yes , he said .
i just don t think this is the proper one .
but as another council member , jennifer frankford , said : if it wasn t for the boots and the gun and helmet , we wouldn t have all the freedoms we have .
the council is supposed to debate the matter again at an upcoming hearing.hall , meanwhile , said his group would support the final decision with caveats .
if [ the council ] doesn t want it as a focal point , that s fine , but we don t want some foofoo fountain either , he said .
everyone s thinking the same thing we re thinking we didn t win the war by throwing sticks and stones .
