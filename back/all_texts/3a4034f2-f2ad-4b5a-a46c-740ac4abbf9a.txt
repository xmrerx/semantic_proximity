Well, North Korea just tested a hydrogen bomb so big that it registered as a 5.1 earthquake.
Yes, we might want to pay more attention to them North Korea wanted what it called the H-bomb of justice as protection from the ever-growing nuclear threat and blackmail by the U.S.-led hostile forces, The Wall Street Journal:An earthquake hit North Korea early Wednesday near the site of the nation s previous nuclear tests and South Korean experts said the seismic activity appeared to be triggered by a man-made explosion.North Korean state radio said Pyongyang would make an important announcement at 12 p.m. North Korea time, according to Seoul s Unification Ministry, which monitors its neighbor s media.The U.S. Geological Survey reported the magnitude of the quake at 5.1, with the epicenter in the northeast of the country, 49 kilometers (30 miles) from the nuclear test site of Pyunggye-ri.North Korea s last nuclear test in February 2013 was of the same magnitude.
In December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the country was ready to detonate atomic and hydrogen bombs, according to state media.AT THE 54:28 MARK TRUMP SPEAKS ABOUT NORTH KOREA: Ted and I have spoken, a lot of us have spoken, because we re talking about Iran -and they are bad actors bad things are going to happen but in the meantime you have somebody right now in North Korea who s got nuclear weapons, and who is saying almost every other week I m ready to use them , and we don t even mention it.
