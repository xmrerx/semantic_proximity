Add one more person whose career or life has been destroyed by the Clinton s as they scratch and claw their way into the White House Actress and comedienne Roseanne Barr revealed that she paid a high price for crossing Hillary Clinton.Barr believes her talk show was cancelled after she gave Paula Jones, who accused former president Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, a platform to speak in 1998.The 63 year-old actress is sure the fate of her show was sealed when she interviewed Jones and did not support the Clinton narrative that the former president was innocent of the allegations.
Liberal Hollywood took note and Barr s show ended, despite its former success, she believes.
There really is a deeper issue underneath the Clintonite spin of this right-wing conspiracy because apparently conservatives are not letting the President keep his pants zipped up, or something.
Here is her 1998 interview with Paula Jones who accused Bill Clinton of sexual abuse: Barr has made no secret of her dislike for the Clintons and has filled her social media with criticism of the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband.
She even caught the attention of Donald Trump who tweeted his thanks for one of her comments.Via: DownTrend
