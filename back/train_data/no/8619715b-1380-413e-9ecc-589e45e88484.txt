vatican city ( reuters ) - pope francis condemned on thursday inequality in healthcare , particularly in rich countries , saying governments had a duty to ensure the common good for all its citizens .
increasingly sophisticated and costly treatments are available to ever more limited and privileged segments of the population , francis said in an address to a conference of european members of the world medical association .
this raises questions about the sustainability of healthcare delivery and about what might be called a systemic tendency toward growing inequality in healthcare , he said .
the tendency was clearly apparent when you compared healthcare cover between countries and continents , the pope said , adding that it was also visible within more wealthy countries , where access to healthcare risks being more dependent on individuals economic resources than on their actual need for treatment .
francis did not mention any countries .
healthcare is a big issue in the united states , where president donald trump has vowed to get rid of the affordable care act , introduced by his predecessor , barack obama , which aimed to make it easier for lower-income households to get health insurance .
he said healthcare legislation needed a broad vision and a comprehensive view of what most effectively promotes the common good in each concrete situation .
in speaking of end-of-life issues , francis re-affirmed the catholic church s long-standing teaching that it is morally acceptable for a patient or a family to suspend or reject disproportionate measures to keep a terminally ill person alive .
but he stressed that this was different from euthanasia , which is always wrong , in that the intent of euthanasia is to end life and cause death .
regarding end-of-life decisions , the pope said governments had a duty to protect all those involved , defending the fundamental equality whereby everyone is recognized under law as a human being living with others in society .
