Michigan Governor Rick Snyder stood before the state legislature and declared that the buck stops with him.
He said that the people of Flint deserve the truth and that they will get it.
Hew said he takes full responsibility and that the government had failed the people.Then he refused to resign, denying the people the basic satisfaction of seeing their grossly incompetent leader step down.The hope for some kind of satisfaction isn t completely gone, however, as the lawyers in a class action suit filed for the people of Flint obtained subpoenas requiring the governor, his staffers, city managers and the Department of Environmental Quality to turn over all documents, records and emails pertaining the crisis in Flint.Lawyers are looking for anything dating back to 2011 referring to three specific items: The Flint River tapped for drinking water, the quality of the water in the river or the KWA pipeline, the main transfer route at the root of the problem.The bad news didn t stop there for Governor Snyder.
Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that it was assigning the former head of the FBI s Detroit field office to lead a criminal investigation.
What the citizens of Flint want, desire and deserve is what laws may have been broken, said Schuette.The controversy surrounding Flint has been treated by Republicans like a simple oops moment.
Jeb Bush has praised the governor for his handling of the situation that has already taken at least ten lives from Legionnaire s disease while calling for the head of Hillary Clinton on a pike over Benghazi.
The entire situation has highlighted just how little republicans tend to think of the people when making decisions that could save a few dollars or earn a few more.Hopefully, Governor Snyder will have no choice when the facts are presented but to step down.
