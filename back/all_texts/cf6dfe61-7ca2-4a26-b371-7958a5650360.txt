Last year, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made national headlines for his insane standoff with government officials over the illegal grazing of his cattle, and now his three sons have followed in his footsteps by taking up arms with about 150 armed and dangerous militia members in an Oregon wildlife reserve.
They are occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in protest of the expected detainment of two ranchers in the area who are expected to face federal arson charges.
Ammon Bundy, the presumed leader of this ridiculous occupation, made a video that was later uploaded to social media, where he said: We re going to be freeing these lands up, and getting ranchers back to ranching, getting the loggers back to logging, getting the miners back to mining where they could do it under the protection of the people and not be afraid of this tyranny that s been set upon them.
These people need to learn that they are not above the law.
This occupation is illegal, and if they are taking up arms against the government they and all of their participants and supporters need to be hauled into federal custody and charged.
That was the mistake before Cliven Bundy and his right-wing militiamen never spent so much as a day behind bars for their insanity.
Now, Ammon Bundy, his brothers, and other like-minded morons want to rule themselves free from government oversight in their own nutty enclave.Another presumed group leader, a man by the name of Blane Cooper, speaks in the video and trashes the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as the equivalent of high school bullies : Until that line is drawn and say we ve had enough of this tyranny, you are going to leave us alone it will not change.
Cooper goes on to encourage more occupations like this one across the country: It doesn t have to stop here.
This could be a hope that spreads through the whole country, the whole United States.
Everybody s looking for this hope because the government has beat us, and oppressed us, and took everything from us; they will not stop until we tell them no.
Perhaps this time, the feds will take these lunatics seriously and arrest them.Watch the video of this insane anti-government speech below:// < !
