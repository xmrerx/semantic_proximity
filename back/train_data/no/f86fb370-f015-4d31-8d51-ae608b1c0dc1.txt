lahore , pakistan ( reuters ) - a newly freed pakistani islamist accused of masterminding a bloody 2008 assault in the indian city of mumbai called on friday ousted former prime minister nawaz sharif a traitor for seeking peace with neighbor and arch-foe india .
hafiz saeed , who has a $ 10 million u.s. bounty on his head over the mumbai attack , spoke at friday prayers after being freed earlier in the day from 11 months of house arrest by a court that said there was no evidence to hold him .
saeed was placed under house arrest in january while sharif was still prime minister , a move that drew praise from india , long furious at saeed s freedom in pakistan .
a supreme court ruling disqualified sharif from office in july over a corruption investigation , though his party still runs the government .
saeed , however , said sharif deserved to be removed for his peace overtures with indian prime minister narendra modi .
nawaz sharif asks why he was ousted ?
i tell him he was ousted because he committed treason against pakistan by developing friendship with modi , killers of thousands of muslims , saeed said .
