washington the house and senate wednesday voted to reject president obama s veto of legislation allowing lawsuits against foreign sponsors of terrorism in the first successful override of a presidential veto since obama took office.the president had vetoed the legislation friday because he said the bill known as the justice against sponsors of terrorism act , or jasta would infringe on the president s ability to conduct foreign policy .
it was the 12th veto of his presidency.but after an intense , lengthy push by 9/11 survivors and families of victims who want to sue saudi arabia based on claims the country played a role in the 2001 terror attack , even obama s democratic allies on capitol hill voted to override his veto .
the final vote tally in the senate was 97-1 .
