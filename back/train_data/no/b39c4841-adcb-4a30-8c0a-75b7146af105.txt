paris ( reuters ) - france s struggling socialist party said on tuesday it had agreed to sell its historic headquarters in paris left bank for 45.5 million euros ( $ 53.89 million ) , after a stinging electoral defeat this year left it strapped for cash .
the mansion - in socialist hands since 1980 , just before francois mitterrand became the party s first leader to rise to the presidency - will be sold to french property developer apsys .
the center-left party won just 29 parliamentary seats in a legislative election this year , down from 280 previously in the 577-strong chamber , causing it to lose state subsidies .
the socialists also suffered an electoral drubbing in the presidential race in may , as centrist newcomer emmanuel macron took power , blowing apart france s traditional two-party system in the process .
the center-left party s candidate limped into fifth place , after francois hollande , whose election five years earlier was hailed as a new dawn for french socialists , did not seek re-election following an unpopular presidency .
center-left parties across europe have struggled to win back voters in the wake of recessions and a global banking crisis that have spawned newer political parties and increased support in some cases for more radical forces on the left .
macron s upstart republic on the move party has now the largest number of seats in the lower house of parliament .
funds from the sale of the socialist headquarters will partly be used for future campaigns .
the party said it would not have to move out until next september .
the socialists are currently being managed by a committee and the party is due to hold a leadership contest next april .
