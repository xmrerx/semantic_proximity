Just judging from Donald Trump s disastrous performance at the first presidential debate last week, it was clear that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came out the winner.
Trump couldn t give solid answers for any of the questions moderator Lester Holt asked, fact-checkers called him out for lying constantly, and his weaknesses on policy were exposed for all to see.
Still, Trump insisted for days that he d won the debate and that he was rising in the polls, all while citing inaccurate or bogus statistics.A new national poll has come out to set the record straight.
According to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll, Clinton is ahead of Trump, 46% to 40% and unlike any of Trump s polls, it s actually legit.
Here s how the election is panning out so far:Now, Trump is probably going to claim that this poll (AND this election, AND the upcoming debate) is rigged because he always comes up with an excuse for why he sucks.
But the truth is, Trump only has himself to blame.This poll also discovered that one of the main reasons Trump is failing so hard is because he s destroyed his chances of appealing to women.
Last election, women accounted for 53% of voters and you can bet that more women than ever will come out to vote in November to prevent the most misogynistic presidential candidate from getting into the White House.
Thanks to Trump s sexist, degrading and objectifying attacks and comments, Trump has pretty much excluded women from his fan base.
Even GOP women hate him!This was especially true for women who were not married.
Trump s standing with minorities is even more horrendous.
He has never even been able to leave the single digits when it comes to African American voters!Good job, Trump!
You re in the home stretch of the election, and you re destroying your campaign by the day.
