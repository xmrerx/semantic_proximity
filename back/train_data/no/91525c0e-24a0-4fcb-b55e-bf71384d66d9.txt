another leftist educator uses the precious time they ve been given to deliver an inspirational speech to high school graduates to instead , deliver a radical , divisive and hateful message .
a missouri high school principal sent some parents toward the exits last week when he made a disparaging remark about police killing young black men during a graduation speech.belton high school principal fred skretta was talking about why he became a teacher when he suddenly veered off in an unexpected direction .
i wanted to be a teacher because i wanted to change the world , i wanted to make it a better place , he told the audience .
i m going to be honest with you , in a lot of ways i fear that we are not there yet .
if we were there , we wouldn t have conflicts between police killing young black men .

some parents were so offended by the commentary they got up and walked out of the ceremony , according to fox 4 news .
i found it very inappropriate , i am highly offended , a parent said .
you don t use the platform of a child s graduation to push a political agenda or push your personal opinions .
your job is supposed to inspire , educate , inform and not indoctronize one way or the other .
interestingly , fox4news reported that skretta posted an apology on social media after the ceremony , but the twitter account appears to have been deleted since then.the apology , according to the fox affiliate : ty all at # bhs graduation !
i apologize if my remarks were offensive .
our law enforcement have difficult jobs & i meant no disrespect # agape doc skretta ( @ principal_bhs ) may 17 , 2015 belton district deputy superintendent , steve morgan , later offered an apology also , fox4news reported .
comments were made at graduation and they certainly are not reflective of the district , so we sent out an apology in a statement today that went to all patrons reflecting that , morgan said.via : bizpac review
