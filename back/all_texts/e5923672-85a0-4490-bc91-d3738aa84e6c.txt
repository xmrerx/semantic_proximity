Once again, Donald Trump s Muslim ban was smacked down by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday, upholding an injunction preventing Trump s executive order aimed at keeping Muslims from entering the country from going into effect.
Further, the Order runs afoul of other provisions of the INA that prohibit nationality-based discrimination and require the President to follow a specific process when setting the annual cap on the admission of refugees, the decision reads.
On these statutory bases, we affirm in large part the district court s order preliminarily enjoying Sections 2 and 6 of the Executive Order.
As predicted, Trump s own tweets about what Trump calls both a travel ban and not a ban were a major reason the Justice Department had no chance of successfully fighting for his bigoted order: Indeed, the President recently confirmed his assessment that it is the countries that are inherently dangerous, rather than the 180 million individual nationals of those countries who are barred from entry under the President s travel ban.
This is the tweet the three-judge panel is referencing:That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017The judges even made White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer regret saying out loud that Trump s tweets are considered official statements by the President of the United States by citing his statement to that effect.The fight against the President* s attempt to keep Jews Muslims from entering the country is not over.
We re winning but the matter will now head to the Supreme Court, on which Trump recently installed someone on whom he can count to do the wrong thing always.Featured image via Getty Images
