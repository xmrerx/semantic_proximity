the initial run of megyn kelly s sunday newsmagazine show will reportedly be taken off the air at least two episodes earlier than scheduled because of her disastrous ratings .
last week , sunday night with megyn kelly set another viewership low with just 2.71 million total viewers .
in the last three weeks , her show has failed to beat the years-old dateline rerun the network ran in her show s time slot when kelly took a week off during the fourth of july holiday weekend.according to the new york post , kelly s ratings-challenged sunday show was announced as a limited run that would return after the football season .
the network was reportedly angling for at least ten episodes but apparently decided to end kelly s misery after eight episodes as kelly s downward spiral in the ratings did not stop.an nbc spinmeister claimed that kelly s show was going off the air after this week s show because she needs to be freed up to focus on her morning show .
translation : kelly needs to do all she can to not ruin nbc s crown jewel today franchise .
network executives , who reportedly have been freaking out about kelly s poor ratings , are probably praying that kelly simply does no more harm than she has already done in her short time at the network .
