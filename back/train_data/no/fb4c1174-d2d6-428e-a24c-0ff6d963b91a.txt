he did not invent anything .
he didn t invent a clock .
he took the guts out of a clock radio that he bought in a store and put it in a pencil box .
this is like pouring cheerios into a bowl and saying you invented cereal .
you know what ron [ reagan ] ?
try to take that through airport security .
-bill mahercan we all just agree that the idea that the muslim clock boy ( a term we coined ) is or has been persecuted is insane ?
this was nothing more than a muslim boy who wanted to see how far he could push his school by bringing a fake bomb to school.wouldn t it be great if the left could take the same dog-on-a-bone approach to defending christianity in this country ?
where were these loudmouth defenders of christianity when obamacare was forcing mandates on people that violated their religious beliefs ?
or how about the baker or florist or pizza shop who all said they would be happy to help serve gay people in their restaurant or perform a service for them , just not in the case of a gay marriage ?
who in the media ( or white house ) ran to the microphone to defend them ? here s the clip from the bill maher show : i m not a fan of bill maher , but i ve got to hand it to him this time he s 100 % correct about the muslim clock boy and how everyone from obama to the media gets an f for epic fail on how they handled this story .
let s just hope some teacher doesn t overlook the next muslim kid who brings a bomb to school in a briefcase out of fear that they might be publicly flogged by the media or our pathetic musim president .
yes we did say muslim president .
