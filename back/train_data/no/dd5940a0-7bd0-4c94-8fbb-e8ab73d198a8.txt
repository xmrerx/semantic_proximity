harare ( reuters ) - a catholic priest is mediating a potential political exit for zimbabwe president robert mugabe , although the 93-year-old is insisting he can only be removed via a party leadership vote , political and intelligence sources said on thursday .
separately , opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who has been receiving cancer treatment outside zimbabwe , returned to harare late on wednesday , a party spokesman said , fuelling speculation about a post-mugabe political settlement .
