washington ( reuters ) - democratic presidential front-runner hillary clinton praised supreme court nominee judge merrick garland on wednesday and called on the republican majority u.s. senate to begin considering his confirmation immediately .
“ evaluating and confirming a justice to sit on this nation ’ s highest court should not be an exercise in political brinkmanship and partisan posturing , ” clinton , a former u.s. secretary of state in president barack obama ’ s administration , said in a statement .
clinton said that the responsibility of the senate does not depend on the “ party affiliation of a sitting president ” and “ it should begin that work immediately by giving judge garland a full and fair hearing followed by a vote . ”
