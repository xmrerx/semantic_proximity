This video will leave you breathless, as you watch a NY Democrat out the Democrat party and the unbelievable voter fraud the commit.
Mayor DeBlasio and Hillary should be sharing a cell together!
The Manhattan Democratic representative on the city s Board of Elections was caught on a secret video slamming Mayor Bill de Blasio s municipal ID program as contributing to all kinds of fraud including at the polls.
He gave out ID cards, de Blasio.
That s in lieu of a driver s license, but you can use it for anything, Commissioner Alan Schulkin said in the undercover video recorded by a muckraker for conservative nonprofit Project Veritas.
But they didn t vet people to see who they really are.
Anybody can go in there and say, I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card, he said in the bombshell tape.
It s absurd.
There is a lot of fraud.
Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud .
.
.
This is why I get more conservative as I get older.
Schulkin didn t hold back to the undercover journalist, who identified herself as a political consultant at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party on Dec. 16.Not realizing he was being recorded, he broke with his own party s position that voter ID requirements hurt the poor and minorities.Schulkin said he backed the IDs to prevent rampant fraud.
The law says you can t ask for anything.
Which they really should be able to do, Schulkin said, according to a copy of the video and transcript provided to The Post.
I believe they should be able to do it, he added.The videographer asked point-blank, You think they should have voter ID in New York?
Schulkin responded, Voters?
Yeah, they should ask for your ID.
I think there is a lot of voter fraud.
Conservatives claim ID checks help curb voter fraud.Liberal and civil rights groups argue such rules discourage voting and discriminate against minorities and the poor.
You know, I don t think it s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an ID .
.
.
You go into a building, you have to show them your ID, Schulkin said.While discussing the potential for fraud, Schulkin volunteered that in some parts of the city, they bus people around to vote .
.
.
They put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site.
Asked which neighborhoods, Schulkin said, I don t want to say.
When the undercover mentions black and Hispanic neighborhoods, Schulkin responded, Yeah .
.
.
and Chinese, too.
At another point in the conversation, he discussed potential absentee ballot fraud.
Oh, there s thousands of absentee ballots .
.
.
I don t know where they came from, he said.The undercover offered that people can cover their faces to shield their identity when voting, which triggered a conversation about burqas.
The Muslims can do that, too.
You don t know who they are, Schulman said.
