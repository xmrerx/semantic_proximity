abuja ( reuters ) - nigerian president muhammadu buhari will pass through london , where he spent five months on medical leave this year , on his way home from the united nations general assembly , his spokesman said on friday .
buhari will depart for new york on sunday , his spokesman said in an emailed statement .
it will be the first time he has left nigeria since returning on aug. 19 from britain , where he received treatment for an unspecified ailment .
spokesman femi adesina said buhari would hold a lunch meeting with u.s. president donald trump and other leaders , adding : president buhari will transit through london on his way back to the country .
buhari will be accompanied on the trip by cabinet ministers and the governors of three states .
nigeria s foreign minister geoffrey onyeama told reporters at the united nations in new york on friday that buhari was in very good health and back to what he was before .
we had a very long cabinet meeting two days ago and he was in excellent form in every way possible , onyeama said .
he s really leading , he s very , very strong and he s back to his very punishing schedule so it s just fantastic .
adesina did not say whether buhari would have medical treatment in london and declined a request to comment further .
the refusal to disclose details of the president s illness has caused speculation about whether the 74-year-old is well enough to run africa s most populous country and biggest economy .
buhari was in london on medical leave for two months from january , and again from may 7 to aug. 19 .
after the first trip , the president reduced his working day to a few hours , diplomats and government sources said at the time .
since the second trip , however , buhari s office has released a flurry of photos and statements from his engagements , including meetings with his vice president , heads of the armed forces and economic ministers .
