before trump , democrats and their allies in the leftist media rarely had to worry about being called out for their hypocrisy .
first of all , there wasn t an opposing voice in the media and politicians in the republican party , most especially the president of the united states , certainly weren t going to call them out .
before donald j. trump , republicans were under the false impression that they needed the press in their corner .
that was before donald j. trump shattered the old rules that protected the media class from scrutiny and allowed them to fully control the narrative.fortunately for every american , there s a new sheriff in town , who is hell-bent on holding democrats and the leftist media s feet to the fire when it comes to their hypocrisy .
president trump posted this hilarious video to twitter yesterday that has already received over 77k likes .president trump tweeted this message yesterday : dems have been complaining for months & months about dir .
comey .
now that he has been fired they pretend to be aggrieved .
phony hypocrites !
