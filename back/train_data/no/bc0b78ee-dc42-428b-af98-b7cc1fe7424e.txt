for some unknown reason , sean hannity decided he had to prove to the world just how traumatized he is by the rising tensions between the united states and north korea.donald trump declared on tuesday that north korea best not make any more threats or else they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen .
so naturally ( not ) , hannity tweeted out that he was ceasing all petty political disagreements for at least [ the ] next 12 hours in light of the current conflict and challenged others to do the same.in light of dangerous nkorea threat , i 'm stopping all petty political disagreements for at least next 12 hours .
let 's see what others do .
sean hannity ( @ seanhannity ) august 8 , 2017that tweet went out at just after three o clock this afternoon .
how long do you think hannity made it before breaking his solemn twitter vow ?
( hint , he already did . )
eight hours .
hannity barely made it eight hours before losing his sh * t and viciously attacking senate majority leader mitch mcconnell .
@ senatemajldr no senator , you are a weak , spineless leader who does not keep his word and you need to retire !
