zagreb ( reuters ) - the croatian parliament began a debate on friday on an opposition no-confidence motion against the government over its handling of a debt crisis that had hit croatia s largest firm agrokor .
the opposition , led by the social democrats , says that the government , which took over administration of agrokor last april , was not running the restructuring process transparently .
it also says that the whole process has been politicized .
the government has failed to provide credible answers on key questions in relation to the law on agrokor , the opposition said in its motion .
the no-confidence motion is unlikely to succeed as the center-right coalition comprising the conservatives and the liberals has a small but firm parliamentary majority .
a vote is expected on friday .
the government introduced an emergency law to intervene because agrokor , the largest employer in the balkans , faced a debt and liquidity crisis .
the opposition has criticized the government for a liquidity loan agreed in recent months with creditors , including foreign investment funds , to finance agrokor s operations through a 15-month period of restructuring .
it said that the loan deal was not transparent and appeared to favor some creditors .
the government and agrokor s crisis manager ante ramljak reject the accusations .
