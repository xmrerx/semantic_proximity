moscow ( reuters ) - u.s .
undersecretary of state thomas shannon will travel to helsinki on sept. 10-12 where he will meet russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov , the u.s. department of state said on saturday .
the meeting will address areas of bilateral concern and cooperation , it said in a statement .
shannon will also lead the u.s. interagency delegation to the u.s.-russia strategic stability talks , it added .
quoting an unnamed russian diplomat , russian news agencies reported earlier on saturday that the ryabkov-shannon meeting in helsinki would take place on sept. 11-12 .
relations between moscow and washington are at their lowest point since the cold war , strained by russia s annexation of crimea in 2014 and the subsequent separatist conflict in eastern ukraine , developments which led washington to impose economic sanctions on russia .
u.s. president donald trump , himself battling allegations that his associates colluded with russia , grudgingly signed into law the new sanctions against moscow that had been drawn up by congress .
