strasbourg/paris ( reuters ) - president emmanuel macron defended new security legislation on tuesday , saying islamist militants still posed a serious threat to france as a two-year state of emergency comes to an end .
the anti-terrorism law , which critics say undermines civil liberties , takes effect on wednesday , replacing the state of emergency that was imposed in november 2015 , when militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across paris .
the law gives the police greater powers to search properties , conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut down mosques suspected of preaching hatred than they had prior to the state of emergency .
speaking to the european court of human rights in strasbourg , eastern france , macron said jihadist terrorism remained the biggest security threat to france .
terrorism targets european society and values just as it targets government and state .
we are being attacked because of what we stand for , said macron , who took office in may .
more than 240 people have been killed on french soil in islamist-inspired attacks in almost three years .
dozens more have been killed in similar attacks elsewhere in europe , primarily in britain and belgium .
the government says the state of emergency has helped intelligence agencies to thwart more than 30 attacks .
many of those emergency powers will now be enshrined in law , drawing criticism from human rights groups .
france has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law , human rights watch said before parliament backed the legislation .
macron said the new legislation would be reviewed and adapted as needed two years from now .
we re fighting terrorism with determination and we will continue to do so within the bounds of the law and with the oversight of judges , macron said .
