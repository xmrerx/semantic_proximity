People are freaking out all over the internet over a winged intruder at a Bernie Sanders rally in Portland.
In the middle of Sander s speech, a small and beautiful bird floated down and joined him on the podium.This is not some Matthew Bay-level CGI effect it actually happened.
Sanders broke off mid-speech as the bird hovered around above him, and the packed stadium laughed and applauded.
But then, to everyone s surprise, the bird actually flew down and settled on the lectern.
I think there s some symbolism here, Sanders said.
That little bird is really a dove asking us for world peace.
This sent the crowd into uproar, and the meme-makers went into overdrive.There was some speculation about what would have happened to the poor bird if it had innocently flapped its way into a Trump rally.
@politico If this was a Trump rally.. his goons would beat it up or one of the cult members would shoot it Greg King (@Megreg916) March 25, 2016And the whole affair is certainly not going to help Portland rid itself of the Portlandia gag #PutABirdOnIt.A little bird told me that @BernieSanders is really a Disney Princess.Also Portland you're taking that #PutABirdOnIt thing way too serious kelly kapowski (@Colo_Kelly) March 25, 2016For those who missed that joke.
Sketch show Portlandia, which satirizes the uber-liberal Oregon city, made it famous with this skit.It didn t take long for the sparrow to become the patron saint of the #FeelTheBern movement, who even honored it with a name.
They continued to praise it at the puntastic hashtag #BirdieSanders.My cynicism for all things political dims in response to #BirdieSanders J. Wolff Hughes (@JWOLFFH) March 25, 2016Even birds love him Make this man the President of the United States already.

Amid all the hullaballoo Sanders himself remained entertained and humble about the whole thing.
The candidate hinted at further partnership with Birdie Sanders, perhaps a potential running mate should he defeat Hillary in the primaries?#BirdieSanders and I are on our way to our rally in Seattle at Safeco Field.
Meet us there: https://t.co/eJGkfGsA5M pic.twitter.com/05LhBpMrne Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 25, 2016And with that Bernie Sanders heads to Seattle, home of the $15 minimum wage, to continue his battle to overcome Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.Featured Image via Screengrab
