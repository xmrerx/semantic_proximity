paris ( reuters ) - corsican nationalists won almost half of the vote in the first round of the french mediterranean island s territorial election on sunday , a landslide likely to fuel local calls for greater autonomy from paris .
the ticket led by autonomist leader gilles simeoni won 45.36 percent of the votes for the newly created , more powerful local assembly , according to final interior ministry results .
a second round will be held next sunday .
president emmanuel macron s ticket only came in fourth with 11.26 percent of the vote .
in the april and may presidential elections , macron had already significantly underperformed his national score in corsica .
macron s republic on the move party said in a statement the vote showed corsicans loss of confidence in the central government and that it aimed to rebuilt trust everywhere in france .
separately , the party also hailed the election of the first mayor associated with macron s movement on sunday , in the southern village of saint-sulpice-la-pointe near toulouse .
