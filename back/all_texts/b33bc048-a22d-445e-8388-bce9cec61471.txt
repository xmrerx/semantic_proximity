What do you think of these comments made by Donald in December, 2011?
Does it even matter to Trump followers when these clips surface of Donald contradicting his current positions?
Is he the only candidate in American history who is immune to criticism by his followers?
Or are Americans so desperate to elect a non-politician who isn t beholden to the major donor class that they just don t care?Here is Donald telling the media the reason he won t agree to do FOX News Debate today:https://youtu.be/wjKVlVLgs3MWatch Donald s interesting response to Megyn Kelly in December, 2011, when she asks him: Do you really think that you re a better moderator than I am?
