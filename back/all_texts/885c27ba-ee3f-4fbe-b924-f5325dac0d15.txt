Many of us are still wondering where the hell Donald Trump s tax returns are.
He keeps telling us that he can t release them because he s in the middle of an audit, but the IRS has already said that s not preventing him from releasing previous returns.Well, Jimmy Kimmel has a theory as to why Trump hasn t released his taxes he s a lying liar.You see, Trump loves to go on and on and on and on and on about how much money he has, and how rich he is, and how yuuuuge his bank account is, but here s the thing, how the hell are we to know?Taking a beautifully sarcastic jab at Trump and his bragging was Jimmy Kimmel on his late night television show.
He shows clip after clip of the reality television star repeatedly telling people how wealthy he is, including how he took a small loan of one million dollars from his father.
Kimmel then says: What if the reason he won t release his tax returns is because he actually doesn t have any money.
He s been goofing on us the whole time.
Like he s Joe Millionaire and we re the stupid contestants.
Wouldn t that be rich?
Very valid theory.
I guess we ll just have to wait and see since Trump is too scared to actually reveal whats going on with his finances.Watch the clip here:He doesn t like to talk about it, but @RealDonaldTrump has a lot of moneyhttps://t.co/3Nnu3XeUID Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) May 19, 2016Featured image via video screen captures
