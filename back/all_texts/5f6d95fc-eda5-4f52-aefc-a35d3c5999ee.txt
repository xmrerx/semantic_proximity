BOSSASO, Somalia (Reuters) - An al Shabaab bomb attack killed 12 people, including five soldiers, in Somalia s Puntland region on Friday, the Puntland military said.
The explosions hit Af-Urur, 100 km (60 miles) south of the city of Bossaso.
Af-Urur is near the Galgala hills, an area controlled by al Shabaab Islamists who have attacked and captured the town several times and in June killed 38 people there.
A bomb planted near the khat market of Af-Urur exploded, Major Mohamed Ismail, a Puntland military officer, told Reuters.
So far 12 people including civilians and soldiers have died.
The attack coincided with Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holiday.
Al Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda and wants to impose strict Islamic law, claimed responsibility.
We are behind the attack in Af-Urur village.
We killed five soldiers and injured 10 others, al Shabaab s military operations spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab told Reuters.
