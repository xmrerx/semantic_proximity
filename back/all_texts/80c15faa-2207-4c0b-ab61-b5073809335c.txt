If there s one rule in politics, it s that you never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER joke about the Holocaust but Donald Trump Jr. apparently didn t get that memo from his white supremacist friends.Sure, Trump Jr. follows numeroous prominent white supremacists on Twitter, gives interviews to Nazi talk shows, and (like his father) retweets the meth-fueled white power crowd like it s going out of style (without realizing that that sort of thing went out of style before Twitter was a thing), but no one really expected him to just joke about the Holocaust after all, even most Nazis display more tact.
The media has been her number one surrogate in this.
Without the media, this wouldn t even be a contest, but the media has built her up, Trump Jr said in an interview with Chris Stigall on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT in which he explained that if Republicans lied like Hillary Clinton whose fact-checked statements reveal she actually tells the truth most of the time, unlike Donald Trump there would be hell to pay:They ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy (sic), on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing.
If Republicans were doing that, they d be warming up the gas chamber right now.
After the interview, Trump told NBC News that he was referencing corporal punishment, not the Holocaust, though he did not state what form of corporal punishment involves gas chambers aside from, you know, gas chambers.
Like all those times Trump Jr. and his father have retweeted white supremacist imagery and propaganda, he says that this was not the least bit anti-Semitic.Hear it for yourself below: Featured image via Getty Images/Jeff Swensen
