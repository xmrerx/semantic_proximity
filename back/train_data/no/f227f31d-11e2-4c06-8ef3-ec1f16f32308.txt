washington ( reuters ) - more than 400 u.s. marines and their artillery are leaving syria after helping to capture the city of raqqa from islamic state , the u.s.-led coalition fighting the militant group said on thursday .
last month , u.s.-backed militias declared victory in raqqa , islamic state s former headquarters in syria , after months of fighting with the help of the u.s.-led coalition .
with the city liberated and isis on the run , the unit has been ordered home .
its replacements have been called off , the coalition said in a statement , using an acronym for islamic state .
we re drawing down combat forces where it makes sense , but still continuing our efforts to help syrian and iraqi partners maintain security , brigadier general jonathan braga , the director of operations for the coalition , said in the statement .
our remaining forces will continue to work by , with , and through partner forces to defeat remaining isis , prevent a re-emergence of isis , and set conditions for international governments and ngos to help local citizens recover from the horrors of isis short-lived rule , he said .
officially , the pentagon says there are 503 troops in syria .
however , as of last week , u.s. officials said there were closer to 2,000 u.s. troops in the country .
the latest announcement would reduce that number .
as that campaign against islamic state winds down , it is unclear how many , if any , u.s. troops will remain in syria .
most of them are special operations forces , working to train and advise local partner forces , including providing artillery support against islamic state militants .
separately , russia said it was already preparing to withdraw its military contingent from syria , russian news agencies reported .
