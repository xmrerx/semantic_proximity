( reuters ) - conservative frontrunner sebastian pinera and center-left alejandro guillier lead a crowded field of candidates in chile s presidential election on sunday , widely seen as a referendum on the reforms of outgoing president michelle bachelet .
the following are the main policies supported by pinera and guillier : - a billionaire businessman who served as president from 2010 to 2014 , pinera has promised to make chile the first country in latin america to achieve developed nation status in the organization for economic cooperation and development , a paris-based club of wealthy nations .
- pinera , the market favorite , would cut corporate taxes to increase investments and said his policies would double economic growth in his term .
- pinera s $ 14 billion , four-year spending plan includes an overhaul of bachelet s tax reform that would cost $ 2.7 billion in new investments in infrastructure and hospitals .
pinera said he would pay for his proposals by cutting unnecessary government spending and simplifying the tax code .
- pinera s $ 3 billion plan to revitalize chile s pension system , which is criticized as delivering small payouts , includes new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class , as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later .
- to help revive cash-strapped state miner codelco , the world s no .
1 copper producer , pinera has committed to overturn a dictatorship-era law that transfers 10 percent of the company s export sales to the military .
he also wants codelco to deploy a realistic investment plan using existing resources and to focus on existing assets rather than new projects .
- guillier , a former journalist elected to the senate in 2013 , has pledged to diversify chile s economy away from the dominant copper industry .
he wants to add value to commodities exports by processing more copper at home and give communities outside santiago a stronger say in decision-making .
- following the lead of ally bachelet , guillier has called for rewriting chile s constitution to formally recognize indigenous communities and to codify the rights of workers to collective bargaining and to strike .
- to boost payouts from the pension system , guillier has proposed raising fiscal spending on pensions and introducing a new , mandatory contribution from employers .
guillier would also increase regulation and oversight of private pension fund administrators .
- like pinera , guillier has called for the repeal of codelco s mandatory contribution to the military , but wants the state-run miner to stay active abroad to ensure it remains the world s top copper producer .
he has also signaled he would seek to maintain codelco s relations with workers that has spared the company the strikes that have hit private miners under bachelet .
