it only took what 14 years for this to happen ?
9-11-01 is a memory that is etched in the minds of every american .
one of the most distinctive memories many of us have following the attack by muslim extremists on our country , was the deafening silence from the huge muslim community in dearborn , mi.the protest against isis in the majority muslim community of dearborn , mi is a good start .
americans can t help but wonder though , why it took so long for muslims to protest these acts of terror by islamic extremists ?
is it because they ve come to the realization that isis is not particularly discriminating about who they target ?
you can t help but notice the muslims in this video are carrying a huge sign telling muslims that 99.9 % of isis victims are actually muslims .
and you certainly can t help but question where were all the protests when al-qaeda and other terror networks announced they were specifically targeting the west.there is no doubt there are muslim americans who love this country .
why wouldn t they ?
we offer freedom of religion , free education , housing , healthcare and food benefits .
what we really need to see is that love for country extended to the love for their neighbors , for their christian and jewish neighbors specifically .
this protest is a good start , but when muslims make an honest attempt to assimilate in our country , instead of coming here with the intent of maintaining sharia law and replacing our cultures and religious values with theirs .
when they make an attempt to assimilate , that s when we ll know and believe they are truly interested in becoming americans , not transplanted muslims from overseas working to turn america into a sharia compliant nation .
