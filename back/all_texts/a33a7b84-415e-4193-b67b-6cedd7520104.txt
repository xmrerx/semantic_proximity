WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday praised Saudi Arabia for exposing Iran s role in Yemen and Tehran s provision of missile systems to Houthi militia fighting there, following the interception of a missile fired toward the Saudi capital Riyadh on Saturday.
We continue to maintain strong defense ties with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and work together on common security priorities to include combat operations against violent extremist organizations, and neutralizing Iran s destabilizing influence in the Middle East region, said Pentagon spokesman Marine Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway.
