A conservative columnist and Trump supporter dropped a bombshell live on CNN when she accused another guest, who is a Cruz ally, of being one of the five women named in the National Inquirer as Cruz s alleged mistresses.
Aside of how 5 women on the planet can possibly be interested in Ted Cruz, what s even more stunning was when Adriana Cohen, a Boston Herald conservative columnist and Trump supporter made the accusation on live television and the reaction that resulted.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_kimVFRsps?list=PL3ZQ5CpNulQkOICciPiSwRCKGVhaug4Fs]When CNN host Kate Bolduan asked Cohen if she thought the two Republican presidential candidates should stop bashing each other s wives, Cohen redirected the conversation and said: Absolutely, I think we should move on and where we should move to is the National Enquirer story that has reported that Ted Cruz has allegedly had affairs with at least five mistresses including, you ve been named, Amanda.
Shocked, Carpenter raised her eyebrows in bewilderment as Bolduan interrupted saying, I m sorry, I don t think that s moving on at all, Adriana.
Cohen said that Cruz should issue a statement either confirming or denouncing the accusation, asking Carpenter if she would denounce her own involvement or confirm it, to which Carpenter said:What s out there is tabloid trash.
If someone wants to comment on it, they can talk to my lawyer.
It is categorically false, and you should be ashamed of spreading this kind of smut.
Donald Trump supporters should be held to account for it.
I will not be intimidated.
Whether the accusations are true or not, the Trump and Cruz campaigns get more embarrassing by the day and their continuous mudslinging and disregard for any decency during their campaign runs is indicative of why neither should be president.
