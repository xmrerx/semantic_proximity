ankara ( reuters ) - a turkish court has sentenced a journalist from the wall street journal to two years and one month in prison in absentia on charges of carrying out propaganda for kurdish militants , the newspaper said on tuesday .
ayla albayrak , a wall street journal reporter with dual turkish and finnish citizenship , was sentenced over a 2015 story about ongoing clashes between turkish security forces and militants from the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) in southeastern turkey .
this was an unfounded criminal charge and wildly inappropriate conviction that wrongly singled out a balanced wall street journal report , the paper quoted its editor-in-chief gerard baker as saying .
albayrak , who is currently in the united states , will appeal against the conviction , the wall street journal said .
the court decision coincides with an escalating row between turkey and the united states after the nato allies mutually suspended visa services on sunday , plunging already strained relations to a new low .
rights groups and turkey s western allies have complained of deteriorating human rights under president tayyip erdogan , and fear the country is sliding towards greater authoritarianism .
in a security crackdown since a july 2016 failed coup , authorities have jailed 50,000 people pending trial and have detained or dismissed from their jobs some 150,000 .
as part of the purge some 150 media outlets have been shut down and around 160 journalists are in jail , according to the turkish journalists association .
given the current climate in turkey , this appalling decision shouldn t have come as a surprise to me , but it did , albayrak was quoted as saying .
