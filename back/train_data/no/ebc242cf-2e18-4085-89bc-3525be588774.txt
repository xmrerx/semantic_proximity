brasilia ( reuters ) - the lower house of brazil s congress voted on wednesday to reject charges filed by prosecutors against president michel temer in a case involving bribes allegedly paid by meatpacker jbs sa , sparing him trial by the supreme court .
with 136 lawmakers voting to throw out the charges , and given a quorum of 477 of them present , temer s opponents could no longer reach the 342 votes required to authorize the top court to put him on trial .
