The whiner-in-chief struck again with yet another early morning Twitter tantrum.Donald Trump can t handle the fact that he lost the popular vote, especially to a woman.Hillary Clinton s margin of victory in nearly 3 million votes, but Trump stole the election with the help of Russian hackers.
Even his electoral vote win is one of the smallest in the last 100 years.But even after the Electoral College wrongly certified him to be president, Trump is STILL complaining about losing the popular vote and is making excuses to explain the loss rather than moving on and focusing on the huge job he s about to take over in January.Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote.
Hillary focused on the wrong states!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote but would campaign differently Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016Trump is even bitching about not being praised by the media for not spending as much money to win.
Of course, why spend money on advertising when you can promise favors for Putin in exchange for help spreading propaganda on the Internet?I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016Apparently, we re going to be hearing Trump whine about the popular vote for the next four years because his ego can t handle losing.And Twitter users were quick to put Trump in his place.
@realDonaldTrump remember when you said the electoral college was bad Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump Losing the popular vote is eating you up like that worm Khan dropped in Chekov s ear.

Cody Johnston (@drmistercody) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump Looks like you still can t get over the fact that an overwhelming majority of Americans rejected you.

(@cristianafarias) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump On January 20th I hope they drive you to the old set of The West Wing and leave you there with a bunch of actors.
Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) December 21, 2016@realDonaldTrump yes Donald, you won.
Continue to gloat.
We all know your win is unpresidented.
Why not spend time doing something for USA?

Now Saturday Night Live will have even more material to mock him with when the show returns.
For now, we ll have to settle for the roasting Twitter just delivered.Featured image via Steve Pope/Getty Images
