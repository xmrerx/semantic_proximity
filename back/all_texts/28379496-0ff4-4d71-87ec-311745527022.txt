It s no secret that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is a tell-it-like-it is kind of guy.
So when he was bombarded with rude questions ( Are you committed to staying in your position as Secretary of State?
How long will you stay for?
How s your relationship with the President right now?)
from the press during a welcome with the Qatari Foreign Minister, he resounded in true T-Rex style:TRANSCRIPT OF THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE PRESS AND TILLERSON:SECRETARY TILLERSON: His Excellency, welcome.
FOREIGN MINISTER AL-THANI: Thank you very much.SECRETARY TILLERSON: Great to see you again at the State Department.FOREIGN MINISTER AL-THANI: Thank you for receiving us.
