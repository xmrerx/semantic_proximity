An ongoing demonstration taking place outside of Anacortes, WA.
The protestors created a blockade on the BNSF Railway tracks, which lead to two oil refineries.
One of which is owned by Shell, the other is owned by Tesoro.
The protest began on Friday, as a part of a global wave of protests against the continued use of fossil fuels.
The international break free protest demands that the world immediately transition to a fossil fuel-free energy system.
Thousands of people all over the world have come together to protest and to take direct actions against fossil fuel companies have taken place on six continents over the course of two weeks.
Last summer we stopped Shell s Arctic drilling plans, now we re taking our biggest actions yet.
The movement for climate justice is growing and getting bolder by the day.
A fossil-free Northwest isn t a fantasy, it s inevitable; if we start now, the change can be fair and rational, and we can demonstrate our leadership, says organizer Ahmed Gaya said in a press release.Below is a video that shows the very beginning of the encampment.In addition to the blockade, thousands of activists in Washington staged marched in protests and took part in a massive flotilla of kayaks holding banners and signs demanding an immediate transformation to a 100% renewable energy system.https://www.facebook.com/BackboneCampaign/photos/ms.c.eJwzNDA0NTczMTY0tzAyNzAyMNMzRIiYmGKImJmiiRiZYerCUGMOEgEAhxkVfg~-~-.bps.a.10157643178105206.1073741894.19984125205/10157643178270206/?type=3&theaterHere is a photo of the police who broke up the encampment:https://www.facebook.com/BackboneCampaign/photos/a.10157647965685206.1073741897.19984125205/10157647965990206/?type=3&theater On Saturday, about 1,500 people took part in a blockade against bomb trains in Albany, New York.I'm in Albany, NY to support the campaign to @BanBombTrains as part of #breakfree2016.

Activists in Germany also disrupted a massive coal mining operation.Here s video footage of the actions in Germany:Climate change threatens every nation that happens to be on planet Earth though it s effects will not be felt by all equally.
Fossil fuel lobbyists have hijacked the governments of the world in order to prevent them from doing anything that might hurt their short term profits, no matter what it costs them and everyone else on Earth in the long run.That s why we need people to rise up and take bold action to encourage politicians to stand up to corporate lobbyists, and to hit corporations that don t give a d*mn about the average person as hard as they can.
