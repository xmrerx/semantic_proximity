A federal aid package was all set to pass the Republican-controlled Senate, and then Ted Cruz blocked it to show how much he hates Michigan, clean water, and human decency.The city of Flint, Michigan has been dealing with a poisoned water crisis since 2014 when Republicans switched the source of the city s drinking water from Lake Huron to the polluted Flint River.Ten people have already died from Legionnaires disease and children across the community face serious neurological issues as they grow up due to high levels of lead in the water.The man-made disaster could have been avoided since it has been public knowledge for decades that the river water is unsafe for human consumption, but Governor Rick Snyder and his cronies thought they could save a buck by switching to it anyway.
And now they have a catastrophe that could cost billions of dollars to fix.And the federal government was incredibly close to chipping in much needed aid when all of a sudden Texas Senator Ted Cruz decided that the people of Flint can wait until he really studies the bill closely before they get a dime.So he placed a hold on the bill, which is pretty damn ballsy or stupid considering the Michigan GOP Primary in on March 8th and Cruz is in a serious fight for his political life with Donald Trump.
Not a very smart move for a man who s going to be in a primary in Michigan on March 8, Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow.
And in Michigan this is a hugely bipartisan nonpartisan issue that everybody cares about.
Perhaps sensing that he was committing political suicide by looking like a total dick, Cruz quickly removed the hold on the bill and let it move forward.But it s just another example of why Ted Cruz should not be allowed to become president.
As president, he could block any emergency disaster relief bill he wants.
Plus, at a time when Americans are sick and tired of partisan bullshit in the Senate, Ted Cruz demonstrated during this particular bipartisan support of a serious problem that he s the only one who is obstructing.This legislation already had broad bipartisan support so there was no reason for Ted Cruz to hold it up beyond him just wanting attention from all the conservatives who support blocking anything and everything that might improve something in this country.Cruz eventually did the right thing, but he should never have put a hold on the bill in the first place, especially at a time when most Americans already see him as the top asshole in the presidential race.Featured Image: Flickr
