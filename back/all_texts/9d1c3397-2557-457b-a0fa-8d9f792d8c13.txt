Even though Donald Trump projects his own narcissistic confidence that he ll be a great president, most Americans disagree.A new Gallup poll shows that the American people do not believe Trump will be able to handle the responsibilities of the presidency.According to Gallup,As Donald Trump prepares to take the presidential oath on Jan. 20, less than half of Americans are confident in his ability to handle an international crisis (46%), to use military force wisely (47%) or to prevent major scandals in his administration (44%).
At least seven in 10 Americans were confident in Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in these areas before they took office.So Donald Trump is entering office with far less support than other presidents have in recent years.Trump s vindictive and divisive behavior combined with his bad temper and utter disregard for established foreign policy are making Americans nervous about how he will respond if a foreign nation merely criticizes him.Trump s predecessors, on the other hand, enjoyed a solid majority of public confidence to do the job.
And that includes President George W. Bush.The deficits in Trump s ratings relative to his predecessors are largely because of the low scores he gets from supporters of the opposing party.
On average, 21% of Democrats have confidence in Trump across the five presidential duties for which Americans also rated Bush and Obama (all except handling the economy and defending U.S. interests abroad).
By contrast, for the same five areas, an average of 60% of Republicans were confident in Obama and an average of 57% of Democrats were confident in Bush.
These data underscore the much more polarized partisan environment in which Trump will be taking office.Donald trump may believe that everyone likes him but the results clearly show, like the popular vote, that Americans really despise him.Also, as Trump enters the White House with an approval rating below 50 percent, President Obama is exiting the office with an approval rating of 55 percent, one of the highest on record for a president leaving office and higher than the historical average.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
