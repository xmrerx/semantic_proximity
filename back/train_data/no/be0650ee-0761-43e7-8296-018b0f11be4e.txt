why the heck do preschool kids need to learn about sexual orientation ?
this is clearly indoctrination and shouldn t be allowed in preschool.preschoolers in colorado are learning about same-sex marriage and other gender issues .
both public and private schools are seeing a push for anti-bias curricula in their classrooms.it s a topic that teachers are not afraid to talk about it.from the preschool level with same-sex couples in picture books all the way to the high school level students and teachers are talking about these issues together .
we ve seen really heartbreaking data that suggests these conversations need to happen and they need to happen early in schools , bethy leonardi said .
she s a professor for future teachers at cu-boulder.she s also the co-founder of the university s initiative called a queer endeavor .
it has helped train thousands of current teachers over the past few years .
the question that we seem to get asked a lot is why do this ?
why so young ?
is it appropriate ?
leonardi said.she also said it s not about taking sides on anything , it s about education .
it s not an agenda .
we re not telling people what to think .
we re saying gay people exist .
there are families with two moms .
some kids don t identify in the binary .
that s it .
