In a city that has more registered Democrats than Republicans, one has to wonder if the sizes of the signs are a problem, or if the excessive number of complaints from Hillary voters is really the issue A 75-year old Maine woman is saying that she would rather go to jail than take down her signs in support of President Trump.Susan Reitman of Rockland, Maine, is displaying two signs in her hometown that read I Love Trump and He Won, Get over it, according to New England Cable News.But the signs are in violation of local law because they are larger than allowed by the town, meaning she could face fines of $100 or more every day they re up.Assistant code officer Bill Butler told NECN that another resident had complained about the signs and that they are not allowed to be displayed without a permit.Signs in the town can be no larger than two square feet, while Reitman s come in at more than three feet by two feet.Reitman is pushing back, saying her right to free speech is more important than the law and has no plans to remove the signs or pay any fines.
If I have to sit in jail for the rest of eternity, that s my choice, Reitman said.
I guess I m being stubborn but I m not going to back down from what I believe.
