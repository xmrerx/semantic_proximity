Melania Trump has been taking a relatively low key position in her husband s bid to become our next President.
She s more than just arm candy for Donald Trump.
She s a tough business woman who s proud to have come to America as an immigrant and earned her citizenship the LEGAL way.
Watch her no-nonsense interview here with leftist MSNBC hack host, Mika Brzezinski, who does everything in her power to provoke her and condemn her husband: I followed the law, Trump said in an interview with Mika Brzezinski aired Wednesday on MSNBC s Morning Joe, in discussing the hoops she had to jump through in order to become a citizen of the United States.
I never thought to stay here without papers.
I had a visa, I traveled every few months back to the country to Slovenia to stamp the visa.
I came back, I applied for the green card, I applied for the citizenship later on after many years of green card.
So I went by system, I went by the law.
And you should do that, you should not just say let me stay here and whatever happens, happens.
Trump, who immigrated to the United States from Slovenia in 1996, said that she and her husband are prepared for people to call him names for expressing his viewpoints.
I m a full-time mom, and I love it.
So, I decided not to be in the campaign so much, but I support my husband 100 percent, she said of her role in the campaign itself.
We have thick skin, and we know that people will judge him and people will call names.
They don t give him enough credit.
From June that he announced, they don t give him enough credit, she said, leading Brzezinski to ask her what she thought about people who felt he insulted Mexicans with his comments that the country is sending rapists and murderers across the border in his announcement speech.
