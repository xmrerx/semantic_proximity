how sweet is this ?
chris matthews had to admit that there s no case in the witch hunt on trump .
chris matthews talks about how the theory came apart : the assumption of the critics of the president , of his pursuers , you might say , is that somewhere along the line in the last year is the president had something to do with colluding with the russians to affect the election in some way .
and yet what came apart this morning was that theory flynn wasn t central to the russian investigation , and secondly , that kills the idea that flynn might have been in a position to testify against trump .
and if that s not the case , where s the there-there ?
how great is today when all of the media big headed pundits have to admit that this entire drama-filled scam is a lie !
