If Donald Trump wanted people to think he isn t joined at the hip to Russian president Vladimir Putin, this is a strange way to do it.
Apparently not satisfied with his own attacks on Hillary Clinton, Trump has now resorted to citing Putin to somehow add extra venom to his catty remarks about the former Democratic presidential nominee.President-elect Donald Trump agreed with Vladimir Putin s assessment of the Hillary Clinton s loss in the 2016 presidential election in a Friday night tweet.The Russian president said Democrats were losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame and said that the loss degrades their own dignity, according to the Washington Post.
Outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves.
Roosevelt certainly would be, Putin told a group of journalists in Moscow, according to the paper.Putin is celebrating the results of the election going his way, as he has had something of a vendetta against Clinton for years after she opposed him while serving as secretary of state.The double-edged attack comes on the heels of revelations that Putin allegedly directed hackers to go after Clinton, stealing emails from Democratic officials including her campaign chairman John Podesta, later delivering those emails to WikiLeaks who published them for the world to see.Trump has denied that Russia stole the emails, instead arguing that it is unknown who did the hacking.
But Trump has actually received intelligence briefings indicating Russian guilt, which he has chosen to ignore in his public statements.The attacks on Clinton also highlight that Trump is still sore about the fact that while he won the election via the Electoral College, he was still the recipient of less raw votes than Clinton.
For all time the historical record will show that nearly 3 million more people voted for Clinton over him.Featured image via Flickr
