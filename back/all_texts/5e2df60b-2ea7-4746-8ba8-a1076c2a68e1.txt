TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras will publish the final result for last Sunday s presidential election at 9 p.m. (0300 GMT) on Friday, said the head of the country s electoral tribunal, David Matamoros.
Honduras has been stuck in political limbo since the election due to problems with the vote count.
The vote count initially favored opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla, then swung in favor of President Juan Orlando Hernandez after it came to a halt on Monday and restarted more than a day later.
