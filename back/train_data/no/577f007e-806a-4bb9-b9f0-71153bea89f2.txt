this was rachel maddow s geraldo rivera moment .
on tuesday night the shrill msnbc host baited audiences with an extended monologue , where she could be seen wringing her hands in anticipation of the big one a scene of hype and overindulgence by the media which was reminiscent of geraldo rivera epic flop , al capone s vaults which aired back in 1986.what followed was almost too ridiculous to comment on .
this was mainstream media fake news at its absolute finest.maddow shows up on air holding the cover pages of donald trump s 2005 federal income tax returns .
the only problem was that it showed trump paying more tax than most people he paid $ 38 million in federal taxes on only $ 150 million in income that year a higher rate than was paid by bernie sanders , barack obama , and even msnbc itself.newsbusters reports : wednesday afternoon , msnbc s rachel maddow gave an interview to the associated press defending her actions following her epic fail regarding the tease and reveal of president trump s 2005 tax returns by blaming viewers for overblowing the revelation .
maddow spoke to the ap s david bauder ( who , to be transparent , has frequently cited and quoted members of the mrc in the past ) and , in bauder s summation , says that if people felt let down by her story about president donald trump s 2005 tax document it s more because of the weight of expectation than anything she did .
bauder noted how a tweet from her account 90 minutes prior to her show set off a social media frenzy and thus expectations were sky high .
it turns out that these leaked irs papers were placed in the mailbox of none other than one of hillary clinton s anointed campaign journalists , michael cay johnston who , with the help of amy goodman at democracy now !
last summer , promoted the accusation that then presidential candidate trump has committed tax fraud .
it appears that johnston was so excited to be the first to get a hold of at least part of trump s tax returns that he didn t bother to consider that a trump operative may have place this big find in his mail box.watch as maddow and johnston labor over this non-story , in one of the most hyped media fails in recent memory : support our work by subscribing & becoming a member @ 21wire.tv
