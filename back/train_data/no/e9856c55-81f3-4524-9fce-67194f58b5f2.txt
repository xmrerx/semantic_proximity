cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian security forces killed five suspected militants in a raid on monday on a desert location being used by the group for training in the nile delta province of sharqiya , north of cairo , the interior ministry said .
security forces arrested six other people and seized ammunition and weapons in the operation , a ministry statement said .
the statement did not link the militants to any specific group .
since 2013 egyptian security forces have battled an islamic state affiliate in the mainly desert region of north sinai , where militants have killed hundreds of police and soldiers .
last month egypt saw its deadliest attack in its modern history when militants killed more than 300 at a north sinai mosque .
no group has claimed responsibility though officials said the gunmen brandished an islamic state flag .
