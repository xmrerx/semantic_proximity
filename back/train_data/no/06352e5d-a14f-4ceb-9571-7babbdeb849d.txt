moscow ( reuters ) - a russian judge on wednesday ordered igor sechin , the head of russian oil giant rosneft and a close ally of president vladimir putin , to appear as a witness in the bribery trial of former economy minister alexei ulyukayev .
ulyukayev was dismissed and put under house arrest a year ago over allegations that he took a $ 2 million bribe from rosneft .
he denies the charges .
ria news agency quoted a court secretary as saying the hearing where sechin would testify would take place on monday , nov. 13 .
rosneft declined to comment .
ulyukayev , who has already accused sechin in court of framing him , was detained on nov. 14 last year at rosneft s moscow headquarters , moments after sechin handed him the cash in a late-night meeting that , according to prosecutors , was designed to catch the minister in the act of accepting a bribe .
analysts say the case is politically charged because sechin represents a powerful faction in the kremlin which favors greater state control over the economy and has clashed with a group of economic liberals in the government that included ulyukayev .
