BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany would support the European Commission if it opens proceedings against Poland over legal reforms there, a spokesman for the German government said on Wednesday.
If it comes to the decision we will support it, Steffen Seibert said.
Western European Union peers, the bloc s executive Commission, opposition in Poland and democracy advocates say reforms undermine court independence by putting them under more direct government control.
