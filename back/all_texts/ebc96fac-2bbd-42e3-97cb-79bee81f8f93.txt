Rachel Maddow is hysterical in the video below She claims that Democrats didn t vote because it rained.
So does it just rain on Democrats and NOT Republicans?Maddow has a history of idiocy!KAREN HANDEL WON A HARD FOUGHT RACE IN GEORGIA S 6TH DISTRICT:Karen Handel won a hard fought Congressional seat in Georgia s 6th district.
The Democrats poured 50 Million dollars into Jon Ossoff s campaign making it the most expensive Congressional race ever!
Handel spoke and thanked President Trump the crowd went nuts and chanted Trump, Trump, Trump!Congratulations Karen Handel.

Liberal Tears CNN IS ISIS #GA06 #Handel #Ossoff pic.twitter.com/cGQdKK0TqS STOCK MONSTER (@StockMonsterUSA) June 21, 2017ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WAS THAT OSSOFF DIDN T LIVE IN THE DISTRICT: Democrat Jon Ossoff said Tuesday that he believes voters in Georgia s sixth congressional district do not care that he does not live in the district he is running to represent, dismissing questions on his residency.
Well, he did work for Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson for 5 years Johnson famously said the island of Guam would tip over but was reelected anyway.
Details, meh Ossoff s residency has been a persistent problem for him during his special election campaign to fill Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price s vacant House seat.
