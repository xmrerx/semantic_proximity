TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike on Monday said she will lead a new national party that will challenge Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a general election expected to be called for next month.
Koike, who named her new political group the Party of Hope, has emerged as a serious threat to Abe after she won the Tokyo governorship a year ago and in July fielded candidates who routed the LDP in elections for the metropolitan assembly.
I want the Japanese people to believe that there is hope for tomorrow, she said at a televised press conference.
Our ideal is to proceed free of special interests, she added.
Koike is an ex-defense minister and former LDP member, and the challenge to her old party could pose a greater risk for Abe, who is expected to call a snap election for next month.
Abe is benefiting from improved ratings and opposition disarray, but should he suffer a big loss of seats it could spur a challenge to his leadership from within the LDP.
A weekend survey by the Nikkei business daily showed 44 percent of voters will back Abe s LDP with only 8 percent supporting the main opposition Democratic Party.
