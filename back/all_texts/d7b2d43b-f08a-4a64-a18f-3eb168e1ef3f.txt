Joe Biden is thinking about running for POTUS in 2020 but this type of anti-gun comment is a huge deal breaker for voters If Biden had used common sense he would realize that the Texas hero stopped the gunman from proceeding with any more deaths when he used his weapon Does Biden believe that if you outlaw a certain type of gun that they won t be out there anymore?
Two words: Bill Clinton Joe Biden says that the man who stopped the Texas church shooter should not have been armed.

Assault weapons are I wrote the last serious gun control law that was written and was law for 10 years, and it outlawed assault weapons and it outlawed weapons with magazines that had a whole lot of bullets and so you can kill a whole lot of people a lot more quickly.
Joe Biden wants to run?
Not gonna happen if he starts to go down this path Remember gun sales always skyrocket when there is an effort to ban them.
The left s logic on this is upside down.
Just because you ban guns or put a sign up banning them in a public place does not mean that people will obey them.
The hero who shot the gunman was a brave American!
Shame on Joe Biden!
