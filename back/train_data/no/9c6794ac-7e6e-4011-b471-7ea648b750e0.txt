mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico s national human rights commission ( cndh ) may take legal action against a bill that would enshrine into law the use of the army in the country s long war against drug cartels , saying it could ask that the measure be ruled unconstitutional .
known as the law of internal security , it will formally regulate the deployment of the military in mexico more than a decade after the government dispatched it to fight drug cartels in a conflict that has claimed well over 100,000 lives .
bucking widespread protests from rights groups , congress on friday gave a green light to the law , which was backed by the ruling institutional revolutionary party and some members of the center-right opposition national action party .
it will now head to president enrique pena nieto s desk to be signed into law .
the new law could lead to the violation of mexicans basic rights and freedoms , affect the design and constitutionally established balance between institutions , state organs and powers , and lead to states of emergency being imposed on mexican society , the cndh said in a statement late saturday .
supporters of the legislation say it will set out clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime .
multiple human rights groups and international organizations , including the united nations , attacked the bill , mindful of the dozens of reported cases of abuses by members of the military in mexico over the past 11 years .
they say it could usher in greater abuses and impunity by the armed forces .
opponents of the bill have taken to the streets to protest and demand the measure not be signed into law .
the cndh said it has asked pena nieto to make the necessary changes to the bill to make sure it upholds human and civil rights .
