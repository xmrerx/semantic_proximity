Racists, homophobes, misogynists and other bigots are out in droves these days and not just in America.
Case in point a rally held by Neo-Nazis in Madrid, Spain, where the hateful group was protesting immigrants.
However, a gay couple there gave these idiots a real run for their money, by choosing to hold an impromptu make out session right in front the moronic haters who chose to refer to them as faggots, queers, and AIDS patients.
It seems that just the sight of the two men holding hands in public was too much for the Neo-Nazis to bear, so the couple decided to give them even more to complain about.David Fernandez and Gregor Eistert were simply out and about like any other couple, having a good time and minding their own business, but their very existence sparked a firestorm of hate from the group.
Their actions were brave beyond belief, as we all know how violent hate group members can be.
Fernandez says of the encounter: I was filled with rage when I heard what they said.
So, I took Gregor and began to kiss him.
It was great.
I then remember hearing screams and insults about being gay.
Unfortunately, it seems that the local police were more concerned with the delicate sensibilities of hate group members than they were with the safety of these two men, though, because they asked them to stop kissing, which is nothing short of shameful.Still, though, good on David and Gregor.
They really stepped up to show these awful people what they think of their hate.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture
