the apple doesn t fall far from the tree chelsea clinton is pregnant with her second child , so in typical progressive feminist fashion , chelsea has abortion on her mind .
in a new interview , chelsea clinton , the daughter of pro-abortion presidential candidate hillary clinton , says she left the baptist church at the age of 6 because it has a strongly pro-life position opposing abortions.clinton made the comment at a recent fundraiser for hillary clinton in an attempt to address evangelicals who question her mother s faith in god .
she said she was upset when teachers in a sunday school class talked about the wrongness of abortion .
my mother is very deeply a person of faith , chelsea said .
it is deeply authentic and real for my mother , and it guides so much of her moral compass , but also her life s work .
i recognized that there were many expressions of faith that i don t agree with and feel [ are ] quite antithetical to how i read the bible , chelsea said .
but i find it really challenging when people who are self-professed liberals kind of look askance at my family s history .
via : life newshmmm .six years old i wonder if that was about the age when chelsea referred to the secret service as pigs .
as we said earlier the apple doesn t fall far from the tree
