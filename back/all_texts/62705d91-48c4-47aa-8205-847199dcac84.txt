WASHINGTON It sits on the Corsica River along the Eastern shore, a 45-acre Russian compound known as the Washington Dacha to those who use it.When it was closed on Thursday as part of the White House s response to what it called Russian interference during the presidential election, questions began to swirl around what took place at the estate in Queen Anne s County.
The main reason it was used was to get rid of spy gear, and to possibly have private conversations, said Pete Earley, author of the book Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia s Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War.
The property in Centreville, Maryland, consists of two Georgian-style mansions, six guest cottages, a pool and tennis court.
It was mainly a retreat for Russian diplomats stationed in Washington according to Earley and wasn t used as a site for spying activities.The site, however, did play a small role in Russian espionage, Earley said.As the story goes, according to Earley, Russian generals at the compound wanted a speed boat to use on the water, but the only one docked there was for diplomats.
