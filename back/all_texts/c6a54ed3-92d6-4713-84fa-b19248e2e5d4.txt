On Thursday, Donald Trump was devastated after an appeals court completely rejected Donald Trump s Muslim ban.
The Trump administration has lost dramatically and completely and they re going to have to decide what to do next, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said following the court s 3-0 complete repudiation of the Trump ban.
The Government has taken the position that the President s decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections, the court said, adding that the Muslim ban runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.
The judges, who were appointed by three different Presidents, flat-out rejected the Trump administration s claim that his decisions are absolute and unquestionable: The Supreme Court has made clear that the Government s authority and expertise in [such] matters do not automatically trump the Court s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals, even in times of war.
There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.
After getting checked, Trump tweeted out an unbalanced all-caps tantrum, vowing that he will SEE YOU IN COURT even though he had just been there, where he lost embarrassingly.SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!
