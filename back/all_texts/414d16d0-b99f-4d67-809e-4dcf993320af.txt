Will radio host and television commentator Laura Ingraham become a prime time host at Fox News?
The word is that Ingraham will be taking the ten o clock spot.The rumor started when Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report hinted that Ingraham had a spot on Fox lined up.Ingraham has been telling friends that the deal is essentially done, with just a few details to iron out, CNN reports.Ingraham s taking over of ten o clock is part of a larger restructuring of Fox s lineup.
Sean Hannity s show will move from its current ten o clock slot to nine p.m. And The Five will move back to five p.m. from its current nine o clock time.This shift was almost certainly prompted by the firing of Eric Bolling and concurrent cancelling of Bolling s panel show, The Specialists, which previously filled the five o clock slot.
Bolling had been under internal investigation following accusations of sexual misconduct on his part, claims which Bolling fervently denies.Bolling s sudden exit is part of a larger shake-up at Fox prompted by allegations of sexual misconduct.
Fox Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes left in July 2016, while Bill O Reilly left in April after 21 years at the network, both for similar reasons.It is not known when the show will begin airing, but CNN s sources say that the deal has been confirmed.
A Fox News spokeswoman denied the existence of the deal to CNN.We certainly hope this is a done deal.
Ingraham gets the Trump voter and isn t in the DC bubble.
Her latest tweet about an hour ago says it all:Time to wake up, GOP.
@realDonaldTrump is ripping up your dog-eared rulebook.
