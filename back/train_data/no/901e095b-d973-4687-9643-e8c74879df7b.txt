paul goodloe was covering hurricane harvey for the weather channel when he spotted a downed american flag .
what he did next was fantastic !
not only did he pull the flag out of the water but he folded the flag properly moment @ weatherchannel reporter retrieved fallen american flag during harvey pic.twitter.com/0l7f7vfljg breaking911 nature ( @ b911nature ) august 27 , 2017 showing respect for our flag is so refreshing since way too many people have been burning it lately .
how to fold an american flag : fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars , holding the bottom and top edges securely .
fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside .
make a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open ( top ) edge of the flag .
