What in the world is wrong with these press people at the State Department!
Is the guy asking the question really serious when he asks the most idiotic question about the timing of the announcements over the release and then death of Otto Warmbier.
We wish we knew the name of the jackhole reporter who asked the question!
Listen to this condescending jerk:THE STATE DEPARTMENT did release a statement when Warmbier was released and when he passed away.
So the question is just the nasty press being nasty.UPON HIS RELEASE PRESS STATEMENT:Press Statement Rex W. Tillerson Secretary of State Washington, DC June 13, 2017At the direction of the President, the Department of State has secured the release of Otto Warmbier from North Korea.
Mr. Warmbier is en route to the United States, where he will be reunited with his family.
The Department of State continues to have discussions with the DPRK regarding three other U.S. citizens reported detained.Out of respect for the privacy of Mr. Warmbier and his family, we have no further comment on Mr. Warmbier.UPON HIS PASSING PRESS STATEMENT:Press Statement Rex W. Tillerson Secretary of State Washington, DC June 19, 2017Today we received with deep sadness the news that Otto Warmbier has passed away.On behalf of the entire State Department and the United States government, I extend my condolences to the Warmbier family, and offer my prayers as they enter a time of grief no parent should ever know.We hold North Korea accountable for Otto Warmbier s unjust imprisonment, and demand the release of three other Americans who have been illegally detained.WOULDN Y A BETTER QUESTION HAVE BEEN WHY OBAMA DID NOTHING TO HELP WITH THE RELEASE OF WARMBIER?
