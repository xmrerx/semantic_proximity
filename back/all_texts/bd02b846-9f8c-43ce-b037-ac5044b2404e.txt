If you don t think that Donald Trump s horrible racist rhetoric is making a difference in the discourse surrounding race in America, think again.
Case in point what happened to one driver at the hands of sanitation workers in Brooklyn, New York.
The workers can be seen on tape blocking a driver s passage after he had tried to maneuver around their sanitation vehicle, which was blocking his way.
They also threatened him with deportation, all the while invoking Donald Trump s hateful ideas.
One worker says to the driver: Behave or you ll be deported.
Another said: Where s Trump?
Where s Trump when you need him?
Luckily, the driver did the smart thing and instead of saying anything to these Trump-loving imbeciles, drove around them another way and left.
These are the sorts of every day confrontations and bullying that are becoming all too common as a direct result of the rise of Donald Trump.
The fact that these workers felt like it was okay to do this while working for the city of New York is quite ominous indeed.
They are the perfect example of what Trump has done to America.
Whether he gets the GOP nomination or not, whether he wins the election or not, he has done monumental damage to America s social climate, and here is your proof.Hopefully, these workers are identified and fired.Watch the video below, via NY Daily News:Featured image via video screen capture
