As Trump begins his second try at softening his image, the progressive Super PAC Priorities USA has begun airing a damning hitting Donald Trump for making fun of a disabled New York Times reporter.The PAC, which is pro-Clinton, has been airing the ad in the swing states of Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire.The ad, titled Grace, features two middle class parents, Chris and Laura Glaros from Columbus, whose child suffers from spina bifida.
While chronicling their lives with Grace and how they deal with her disability, Laura turns the conversation to none other than Donald Trump:When I saw Donald Trump mock a disabled person, I was just shocked All the children at Grace s school know never to mock her.
And so, for an adult to mock someone with a disability is shocking.Chris then hit the blowhard nominee, adding:When I saw Donald Trump mock somebody with a disability, it showed me his soul, it showed me his heart, and I didn t like what I saw.During Laura s segment, the ad cuts to footage of Trump making fun of Serge Kovaleski, who dared to challenge Trump s very false and very offensive claim of seeing Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 terrorist attacks.According to watchdog Open Secrets, Priorities USA has raised (for the 2016 election cycle) $76 million, and has spent $29 million, a big chunk being used for media advertisements like Grace.
Never mind the fact Trump has insulted the integrity of those who have dared to questioned him, it takes a special kind of monster to attack a man based on his disability, not his reporting.
And thanks to Priorities USA, the whole country (especially people living in crucial swing states), will be reminded of who Trump really is a monster.Watch the ad below, courtesy of Priorities USA:Featured image a screen caption
