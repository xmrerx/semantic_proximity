(Reuters) - The Republican-controlled Wisconsin State Assembly voted 59-30 on Thursday to approve a bill that paves the way for a $3 billion incentives package for a proposed liquid-crystal display plant by Taiwanâ€™s Foxconn.
The plan still needs to be approved by the joint finance committee, which has both Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate members, as well as the state Senate before going to the governor.
The finance committee and state Senate are also controlled by Republicans.
