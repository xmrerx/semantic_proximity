This is the usual Pelosi act where she giggles and then says something so bitter and mean that you just can t believe it.We have quite a collection of Pelosi-isms Keep it up Nancy!NANCY CAN T CALL TRUMP HER PRESIDENT GIGGLE, GIGGLE Nancy Pelosi couldn t sink any lower than this.
She was doing a question and answer when she giggled and said she can t call Donald Trump president Trump.
The oddest behavior comes after the giggles.
She goes on to brag about her position in the Democrat Party and how she was so looking forward to Hillary s win.
It s quite a delusional rant.How can the Democrats be taken seriously when they behave this way?
Pelosi isn t the only one.
Maxine Waters is a very close second in the wacky category.
See the video below this one where she goes ballistic on a woman who said I love my president .PELOSI GIGGLES LIKE A CHILD:
