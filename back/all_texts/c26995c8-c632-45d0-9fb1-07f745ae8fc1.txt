It can be said that Florida, while being a very popular vacation destination, is probably more dangerous than the Outback of Australia.
Between the wildlife, the mosquitoes, and people like George Zimmerman, it s not always the safest place to be.Fox News just made this abundantly clear.No, they re not warning people about guns or alligators running amok, Fox News host Shepard Smith just told everyone living along the Atlantic coast in Florida that if they don t take the storm warnings seriously, then they re going to die.
No ifs, ands or buts.Watch Smith s doomsday prediction here:Thanks Fox News!

Smith asks a Florida woman: Do you expect us to cover your funeral?
[ad3media campaign= 1070 ]You ve said some crazy things over the years, Fox News, but this may take the cake.Meanwhile, Matt Drudge is telling us it s a conspiracy:The deplorables are starting to wonder if govt has been lying to them about Hurricane Matthew intensity to make exaggerated point on climate MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) October 6, 2016Yeah, that damn government wanting people to stay safe.
HOW DARE THEY?
!With all of that said, Hurricane Matthew is very, very strong and very dangerous.
If you ve been told to evacuate, hopefully you listened.
Your life is worth more than any bit of property you re worried about losing.
You can never get your life back if lost.
Please be safe if you re in the path of the storm.Featured image: Screen capture via Esquire
