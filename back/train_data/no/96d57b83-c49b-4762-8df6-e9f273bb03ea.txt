the video below is a classic from the campaign .
it s rare that cnn doesn t cut people off like this man .
gary frazier gives a dose of truth serum to the panel on cnn but they won t listen this is awesome ! katrina pierson commented and then frazier was asked to respond .
well , the last thing that cnn s carol costello expected was agreement from frazier .
the other panelists try and tell frazier he s wrong .
lol !
you tried to send us oprah then you sent us obama the truth is that the dnc has used race as a tool to divide for decades .
they don t want the black community to rise up and see the truth .
it s been great for the democrats to have the black community s support and they don t want to lose those votes .
that s why you constantly hear people in power trying to create racial strife it s been profitable for them in so many ways .
until we start to have a real conversation about what we re going to do with those in the minority communities , how can we ever get behind such corruption ?
thank you gary frazier for telling the truth ! trump s chair for diversity outreach slams cuomo this is great !
