yep the guys who is caught on tape openly advocated for killing cops is the same guy msnbc hired to host his own show .
it s the same guy who makes regular visits to our white house to discuss strategy with our race baiter in chief .
imagine if this was a white man calling for a group of people to kill cops .
would his presence at the white house be tolerated by a single american ?
yet , in the crazy world of the left , his presence is not only tolerated , it is deemed necessary to stir up the vote for democrats in the black community in 2016 .
we all know that without a single black candidate running for president , the only way to get the same voters to the polls that came out in droves for barack is to stir it up on the streets .
by pitting whites against blacks and and blacks against cops they believe their giving the black voter a compelling reason to vote for hillary or bernie.here s watters interview with sharpton where denies saying he believes in offing the cops .
here s the clip showing al sharpton saying the things he denies saying : i don t believe in marching .
i believe in offing the pigs .

sharpton exclaimed , encouraging the laughing audience to physically take on law enforcement .
he added , do what you believe in .
or shut up and admit you ve lost your courage and guts to stand up .
ain t nobody holding you .
i ll off the man .
well off him .
plenty of crackers walking right around here tonight .
