agents felt up mrs. manafort lying in bed to see if she had guns , the source said of the intimidation.in all , 12 fbi agents entered the home , guns drawn , and stayed for hours.the aggressive search of a prone sleepy woman is , the source said , a hallmark of mr. mueller s top prosecutor , andrew weissmann .
