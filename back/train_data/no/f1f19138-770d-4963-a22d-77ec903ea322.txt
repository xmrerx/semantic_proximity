copenhagen ( reuters ) - twelve north african migrant stowaways have been repatriated after being stuck on a ferry sailing back and forth between turkey and ukraine for three months , the ferry operator said on wednesday .
with neither turkish nor ukrainian authorities willing to accept the migrants , the men had been locked in their cabins while the ferry continued taking goods and passengers between istanbul and odessa .
denmark s dfds , which owns and operates the ferry , said a special task force set up by the danish foreign ministry helped find a diplomatic solution so the men could return home .
six of the men , who boarded the ferry hidden in trailers with goods from turkey , were identified as algerians and sent home on oct. 29 .
the other six were on their way back to morocco on wednesday .
the men had to be locked in guarded cabins because they had a tendency to be violent , a dfds spokesman said .
dfds had invited authorities from the united nations aboard to question the men , while the danish foreign ministry held talks with turkey , ukraine and lithuania , under whose flag the ferry was sailing , to resolve the situation .
