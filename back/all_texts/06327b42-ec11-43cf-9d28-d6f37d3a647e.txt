Kasowitz, he was turned down by some of the biggest names in the legal profession because Trump wouldn t listen to their advice, and even if he did listen he would continue his long tradition of not paying people he hires:The lawyers and their firms cited a variety of factors in choosing not to take on the president as a client.
Some, like Brendan Sullivan, said they had upcoming trials or existing commitments that would make it impossible for them to devote the necessary time and resources to Trump s defense.Others mentioned potential conflicts with clients of their firms, such as financial institutions that have already received subpoenas relating to potential money-laundering issues that are part of the investigation.But a consistent theme, the sources said, was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position.
The concerns were, The guy won t pay and he won t listen, said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration, as well as deliberations within the firms themselves.In addition, there are fears that association with The Donald would kill recruitment because of the shame involved in serving Trump willingly.
