washington ( reuters ) - u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton will call for higher trade standards at a saturday campaign stop in youngstown , ohio , to ensure that automakers that use largely foreign parts are not given preference for producing “ made in america ” cars .
her campaign said clinton will tell supporters she will take a stand against weak “ rules of origin ” and will say the pending trans pacific partnership , a trade compact with 12 nations , is not stringent enough .
the tpp , which is being finalized by the obama administration , sets the content threshold for “ made in america ” cars at 45 percent .
clinton has said she opposes the tpp because it does not do enough to protect u.s. workers .
international trade deals have become a flash point in the u.s. presidential race .
