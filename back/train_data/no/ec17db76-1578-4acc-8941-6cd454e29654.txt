( reuters ) - kansas governor sam brownback offered options on wednesday for dealing with sinking revenue for the state ’ s current and next budgets , including the sale of tobacco bonds .
with the fiscal 2016 revenue estimated to drop by nearly $ 94 million and fiscal 2017 revenue expected to be $ 134.7 million less than previously projected , the republican governor said kansas could raise about $ 158 million through its first sale of bonds backed by its share of a 1998 multi-state settlement with u.s. tobacco companies .
several states and local governments have sold tobacco bonds with some using the proceeds as a one-time boost for their sagging budgets .
brownback said he would also divert $ 185 million in sales tax revenue slated for the highway fund to the fiscal 2016 and 2017 general fund and continue a 3 percent university funding cut into fiscal 2017 .
a second budget-balancing option outlined by the governor would delay a fiscal 2016 fourth quarter pension payment until fiscal 2018 instead of selling tobacco bonds .
a third option calls for a 3 percent to 5 percent spending cut for most state agencies in the coming fiscal year .
“ i am prepared to take executive action to help reduce expenditures , however , the legislature has a constitutional obligation to balance the budget and we are hopeful they will work with us on one of the three options .. , ” brownback said in a statement .
he added that he does not support a tax hike to patch up the budget .
the kansas budget is feeling the effects from action taken by brownback and the republican-controlled legislature to cut corporate and other income taxes to help the state compete with bordering missouri and other states for business development and jobs .
kansas ’ fiscal year begins july 1 .
