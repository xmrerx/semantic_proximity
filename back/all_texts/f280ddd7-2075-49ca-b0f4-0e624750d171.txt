BERLIN (Reuters) - Members of Germany s Social Democrats (SPD) will get to vote on any decision by the leadership of the center-left party to join a future coalition government, leader Martin Schulz said on Friday.
There is nothing automatic about the direction we are moving in, Schulz said.
If a discussion results in us deciding to participate in any form whatsoever in the formation of a government, we will put it to a vote of party members.
Schulz made the remarks said during a brief news conference, shortly after the German president announced he would host a meeting next week with Schulz and Chancellor Angela Merkel to find a way out of a political impasse.
