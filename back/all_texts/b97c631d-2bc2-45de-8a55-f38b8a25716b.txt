While appearing on Good Morning America s Coffee with the Candidates town hall, Hillary Clinton, who emerged victorious in a hotly fought over New York, laid out her plan to combat systemic racism in the criminal justice system which includes giving those who serve time their voting rights back.When asked how she would reform America s broken criminal justice system (which was due in part to the 1994 crime bill), she answered candidly:One, divert people away from the criminal justice system because too many people are in for low-level, non-violent offenses.
Secondly, we have got address the unequal effects of the criminal justice system on people of color, particularly African American men because it is just wrong and it is a result of systemic racism we have to have more second chance opportunities Once you ve paid your debt to society, your voting rights should be returned immediately.Her last answer drew thunderous applause from the audience, and for good reason.Currently, 12 states do not allow those who have served their time, meaning they are no longer in prison and no longer on parole, to vote.
Over 5.85 million Americans, which accounts for 2.5 percent of the voting age population, are currently unable to vote due to a current or previous felony conviction, according to an analysis by the Sentencing Project.
Roughly 75 percent of the 5.85 million who are disenfranchised are out of prison and living within their communities.Clinton s call to restore voting rights comes as she and Senator Sanders face off in the Maryland primary election on April 26.
Maryland, this year, passed a sweeping voting rights law into effect, granting over 40,000 ex-felons their right to back.Along with automatic voter registration and the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, Clinton s voting plan has a direct impact in dealing with systemic racism in this country.Former Attorney General Eric Holder reminded the public about the link between disenfranchisement and crime, both riddled, latently and blatantly, with racism:It is time to fundamentally reconsider laws that permanently disenfranchise people who are no longer under federal or state supervision.
By perpetuating the stigma and isolation imposed on formerly incarcerated individuals, these laws increase the likelihood they will commit future crimes.Now, how many Republicans are talking about this issue?Here s the clip from Clinton s town hall discussion: Once you ve paid your debt to society, your voting rights should be returned immediately.
