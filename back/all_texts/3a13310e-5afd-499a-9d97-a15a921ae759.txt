It s interesting how many of these celebrities who hate America and American citizens have no problem taking their money Pop star Ariana Grande said her words were taken out of context when she was caught on camera saying she hates America.
A video of Grande slamming the U.S. was posted by TMZ on Tuesday.
The video shows the singer licking a doughnut at a California doughnut shop when she thought no one was looking.
When an employee brought out a tray of oversized doughnuts, the Florida-born singer blurted out, What the f k is that?
I hate Americans.
I hate America.
The employee told CBS Los Angeles that Grande was rude and even spit on the doughnuts.Now she says that was a mistake.
I am EXTREMELY proud to be an American and I ve always made it clear that I love my county (sic), Grande told FOX411 in a statement.
What I said in a private moment with my friend, who was buying the donuts, was taken out of context and I am sorry for not using more discretion with my choice of words.
The 22-year-old explained she was frustrated by how freely we as Americans eat and consume things without giving any thought to the consequences that it has on our health.
She admitted that she should have known better in how [she] expressed [herself], but seeing the doughnuts reminded her that the United States has the highest child obesity rate in the world.
We need to do more to educate ourselves and our children about the dangers of overeating and the poison that we put into our bodies, she added.Grande also addressed rumors that she pulled out of the MLB All-Star Concert because of the video after her representative said Wednesday the singer would not perform Saturday at the Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati.
As for why I cannot be at the MLB show, I have had emergency oral surgery and due to recovery I cannot attend the show.
I hope to make it up to all those fans soon.
