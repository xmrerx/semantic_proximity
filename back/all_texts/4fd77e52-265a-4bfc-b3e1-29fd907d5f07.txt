This is in such poor judgement by the teachers of this school.
You have to wonder what they were thinking!A number of teachers in a Texas school district are being disciplined after naming a student most likely to become a terrorist.
Lizeth Villanueva, a seventh grader, received a certificate during a mock awards ceremony Tuesday at Anthony Aguirre Junior High in Channelview, Texas, near Houston.
Lizeth said the teacher who signed it handed out certificates to a number of students while other teachers watched and laughed.
They just found it as a joke, said Lizeth, 13.The awards were given out a day after the suicide bombing at the end of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England.
She said that some people might get offended, but she doesn t really care about our feelings, Lizeth said.
She was laughing about it.
It s no laughing matter to Lizeth s mom.
I read it twice.
I m like, What is this?!
