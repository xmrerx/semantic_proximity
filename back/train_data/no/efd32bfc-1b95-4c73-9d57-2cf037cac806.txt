henniker , n.h. ( reuters ) - u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton said during a student town hall on saturday that student loan servicer navient corp has been “ misleading people ” and “ doing some really terrible things. ” “ their behavior is outrageous , ” clinton said at new england college , where she was campaigning ahead of the state ’ s nominating contest on tuesday , feb. 9 .
clinton ’ s criticism of the student loan servicer comes after she lost badly among young voters to democratic challenger bernie sanders in last week ’ s iowa caucus .
she received 11 percent of the vote among 17 to 24 year olds who caucused in iowa versus 86 percent who supported sanders , according to a nbc news exit poll .
clinton ’ s statements came in the response to a question from the audience related to student debt .
navient is being investigated by the consumer financial protection bureau over late fees and other matters , the company revealed in an august regulatory filing .
“ we understand the politicization of student loans , but we remain focused on delivering excellent service to our customers , ” said navient spokeswoman patricia christel in a statement , inviting clinton to come meet their “ hardworking employees and learn firsthand about our industry-leading default prevention work. ” ( reporting by amanda becker ; editing by james dalgleish and nick zieminski ) sap is the sponsor of this content .
