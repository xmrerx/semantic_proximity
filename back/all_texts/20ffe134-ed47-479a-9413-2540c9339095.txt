The White House may have verified the legitimacy of Donald Trump s tax returns after they were released by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, but that didn t stop Donald Trump from turning around on Wednesday and claiming that they are FAKE NEWS.
Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, went to his mailbox and found my tax returns?
Trump screeched on Twitter.
FAKE NEWS!
Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, "went to his mailbox" and found my tax returns?
@NBCNews FAKE NEWS!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2017First off, people have heard of Johnston.
He s been around for quite a while and has even written a book about Donald Trump a fact that would attract someone who would want to leak some of Trump s tax returns, especially since it was his tax reporting that earned him his Pulitzer.The puzzling nature of Donald Trump s outburst was not lost on the American people, who showed up to mock him for calling something that is 100% fact FAKE NEWS, especially when there is every reason to think that Trump leaked the document himself:.
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews It actually shows you paid taxes why on Earth would you say fake news?
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) March 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews the document that was in the mailbox was a photocopy of YOUR version of the document.
The leak was on YOUR end.
Kevin (@TheKevinDent) March 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews You planted those tax returns.
Why else would it say "client copy"?

Jeffrey Grubb (@JeffGrubb) March 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump @oppstn And if they're fake news why did the White House release a statement with the same data as the returns he had?

@realDonaldTrump Fake news, or fake outrage?
Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) March 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews FAKE NEWS?
You confirmed the validity of the tax return.
How could this possible be fake?
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews He won the Pulitzer for reporting that's why YOU'VE never heard of him.

Ned Newhouse (@Ned_Newhouse) March 15, 2017Donald Trump has a long history of leaking information about himself that, like this partial tax return, would be viewed as positive for him.
That fact, combined with the words CLIENT COPY stamped across the top of the returns, is a strong indicator that The Donald did an impression of two Russian prostitutes standing on President Obama s bed in a Moscow hotel he leaked himself.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab
