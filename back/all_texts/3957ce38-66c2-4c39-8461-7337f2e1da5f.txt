Sometimes in life, with all the negativity that seems to saturate our media outlets, it s important to be reminded that there are still extraordinarily kind human beings still out there.
One great example of this could be found in a recently taken video on a New York City subway train.NYC in the winter can be brutal.
It s even more brutal if you re homeless and don t have much of anything to your name, including the necessary items of clothing to stay warm.
On one subway train a man was without a shirt and visibly shivering as he sat by himself.
However, what happened next was absolutely breathtaking.Another subway passenger strips down and takes off his shirt.
At this point you can see this is where the video recording of the event begins.
The man walks over to the man without a shirt, and not only offers him the shirt off his back, but also helps him put it on.
And he didn t stop there.
He went back and got his warm stocking cap and placed it on the downtrodden man s head.This good samaritan s name is Joey Resto, and according to ABC news: [He] was taking the downtown A train to his home in Brooklyn after work this past Friday when he noticed a homeless man without a shirt shivering from the cold.
At the time, temperatures in the city were hovering around 45 degrees.
Resto said: He looked cold, hungry like he had just gotten beat up He looked so weak and frail.
I had to help him, or he would not put it on.
It just came from the heart.
I don t know how anyone could have walked past him and had extra clothing and not given it to him.
On top of everything he did, Resto still wishes he could have done more, and maybe had something warmer to offer him.Not everyone is the type of person to do what seems so innately right.
Many stand by and watch as others suffer, but then there are people like Joey Resto who did what he could, no matter how big or little, to make someone else s existence just a little bit better.
Well done.
