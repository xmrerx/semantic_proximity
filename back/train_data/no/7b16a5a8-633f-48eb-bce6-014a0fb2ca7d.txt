after watching this video , it becomes very clear that these students want nothing to do with racial harmony .
this movement is about black power .
it s about treating people a certain way based solely on the color of their skin .
there is nothing about this movement that attempts to bring people together .
the black students have taken over the movement and kicked the asian , white and hispanic students who are supporting them to the curb .
this divisive # blacklivesmatter movement will go down as one of the most deceitful movements in our nations history students at claremont mckenna college in california who are demanding a racially segregated safe space for marginalized identities , silenced and embarrassed an asian woman when she described how she had been racially harassed by an african-american man.the exchange is damning because it illustrates how the safe space students don t really care about racism , they only care about race baiting and exploiting identity politics in order to obtain power .
