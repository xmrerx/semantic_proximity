BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s regional government said it would allow voters in Sunday s banned independence referendum to vote at any polling station they found open in the region, if their designated voting booth was closed.
In a further step to make it easier to vote, voting slips printed at home will be accepted as valid, Jordi Turull, the regional government s spokesman told a news conference.
After a court banned the vote, Spanish police arrested Catalan officials, seized campaign leaflets and sealed off many of the 2,300 schools designated as polling stations.
