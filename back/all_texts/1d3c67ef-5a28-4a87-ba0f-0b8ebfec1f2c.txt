WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump gave his in principle approval to lift restriction on South Korea s missile payload capabilities, the White House said on Monday.
Trump agreed to strengthen joint military capabilities during a call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and gave conceptual approval for South Korea to buy billions of dollars of weapons from the United States.
North Korea said it tested an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile on Sunday, prompting global condemnation and a U.S. warning of a massive military response if it or its allies were threatened.
