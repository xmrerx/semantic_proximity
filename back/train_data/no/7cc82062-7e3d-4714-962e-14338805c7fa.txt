happy super tuesday !
here are the results so far , courtesy of weasel zippers .
the win for donald trump may not be as yuge as he had hoped , but he and hillary come out of super tuesday as the clear winners of the super tuesday states.here s a link to the results .
in some of the states you have to get at least 20 % to get any delegates at all.10:49 here s the estimated delegate count at this point by the ny times:10:26 rubio may end up winning minnesota , he s ahead by 10 points at this point.10:15 ted cruz : january 20 , 2017 will be barack obama s final day in office .
our campaign is the only one that can beat , has beaten and will beat donald trump .
i congratulate donald trump on his victories tonight .
15 states have voted and every one has been won by me or donald trump .
for the candidates who have not won , i ask for you to come together and uniting .
head to head we beat donald , so we must come together.10:12 ben carson not dropping out .
fox still talking about maybe , maybe rubio can get some delegates.10:05 trump : i don t know if hillary is going to be allowed to run , what she did was a criminal act .
i am a unifier , when we unify there is no one who is going to beat us.trump seems to be taking a conciliatory attitude toward ted cruz , not so rubio.9:49 trump sounding presidential , saying will win in november , that many polls say he would win .
however , most polls actually show he would lose to hillary , except for one poll , the usa today poll.trump congratulates cruz on winning texas , and says rubio did badly.9:37 trump press conference about to start .
word is it s endorsement of gov .
rick scott of florida .
that might have some effect in the race there on the 15th .
guess not :
