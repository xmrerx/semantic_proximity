the setting for this episode is yale university , a campus that s been embroiled in a number off social justice controversies over the past couple of years .
a major donor is visiting the campus and two administrators are taking him around campus .
every time they turn around the donor seems to be offending someone or violating someone s rights .
the donor offers to endow a nuclear plant management .
one of the administrators quickly informs him that they can t do nuclear and that he d be creating a space for violence to happen .
the other administrator informs him that their students are highly entitled wusses .
the donor asks if it s still a coven of capitalism where evil money can acquire a patina of virtue ?
the writers for fox s the simpsons make a point of letting the viewers know that one of the most idiotic lines uttered in the segment , you d be creating a space for violence to happen is an actual quote , as they flash , actual quote from yale student on the screen .
in the end , the joke is on the students , as the major donor who is also childless , pulls his contribution to the university and heads literally explode over homer s offensive costume.enjoy :
