mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico central bank governor agustin carstens said on friday he is “ implicitly ” factoring in the possibility of republican hopeful donald trump becoming u.s. president in the bank ’ s economic risk models .
in an interview with el financiero/bloomberg carstens was asked whether the chances of trump , a persistent critic of the north american free trade agreement , becoming the next president of the united states was in the central bank ’ s risk models .
“ well , explicitly , no , ” carstens said .
“ but implicitly all of us have it in our heads , this possibility. ” carstens was also asked about mexican monetary policy in the coming months after the bank launched a surprise rate hike on feb. 17 to shore up the peso currency , which had been falling sharply against the dollar since the end of 2014 .
he reiterated that the february move was not the start of a monetary policy tightening cycle , but that the bank would be following moves by the u.s. federal reserve closely .
“ our monetary policy will above all be led by ... the exchange rate , the monetary policy relative to the united states and the inflationary pressures that could occur due to the economic cycle in mexico , ” the central bank governor said .
trump , front-runner to win the republican presidential nomination for the nov. 8 election , sparked outrage in mexico with campaign vows to slap tariffs on mexican exports and to build a southern border wall and make mexico pay for it .
mexican president enrique pena nieto said this month his country would not pay for trump ’ s proposed wall along the u.s.-mexico border , and likened his “ strident tone ” to the ascent of dictators like adolf hitler and benito mussolini .
