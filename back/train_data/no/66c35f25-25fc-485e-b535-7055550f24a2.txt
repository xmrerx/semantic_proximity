mexico city ( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential front-runner donald trump ’ s political rhetoric is “ racist , ” and evocative of adolf hitler , former mexican president felipe calderon told reporters at an event in mexico city on saturday .
“ this logic of praising the white supremacy is not just anti-immigration , ” calderon said .
“ he is acting and speaking out against immigrants that have a different skin color than he does , it is frankly racist and [ he is ] exploiting feelings like hitler did in his time , ” calderon said .
trump has accused mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the u.s. border and has said he will make mexicans pay for a wall on the border .
felipe calderon was president of mexico from 2006-12 .
