In response to Trump s outrageous remarks about abortion, Ann Coulter upped the ante by claiming that the border wall will cut the abortion rate by keeping Latin American rape culture out of the nation.Two days after calling Trump s idea to punish women for choosing to have an abortion fabulous, Coulter appeared for an interview with MSNBC host Chris Matthews and not only doubled down, but entwined abortion, rape, and immigration into one big offensive remark that should cost the Republican Party the votes of Hispanics and women for generations.Coulter attacked Ted Cruz for portraying Trump as a pro-choice supporter of universal healthcare before chiming in on abortion and how it s not an issue the president should get involved with.
If Donald Trump was running for state legislature in the year 2060 after Roe v. Wade was overturned and happens to be in a place that will pass those laws, that s a relevant question, she said.But then Coulter went off the rails completely by claiming that Hispanic immigrants are rapists who are responsible for the number of women who need abortion services.
The solution, Coulter insisted, is Trump s proposed wall between Mexico and the United States.
I think I d be a lot more upset that women are going to get a lot more abortions if we don t close our border with Mexico and bring in all of Latin American rape culture.
Coulter went on to claim that Trump is the guy to vote for if women want a president who will protect them.Here s the video via YouTube.First off, if women want a candidate who has their best interests at heart, Donald Trump is most certainly not the candidate they should support.
Trump has already suggested punishing women who seek an abortion, which alone should be enough to prove that he doesn t give a damn about women.Furthermore, Coulter repeated Trump s racist accusation that all Hispanic immigrants are rapists, only she added to it by claiming that they re responsible for women needing abortions.In short, Republicans should be scared to death because their front-runner has just pissed off both Hispanics and women like no candidate has ever done before.
Even Ted Cruz has waded into the abortion debate by telling Fox host Megyn Kelly that he wants to force rape victims to carry their rapist s baby to term instead of giving them access to abortion.
So Cruz is no better than Trump when it comes down to it.The bottom line is that this is by far the most despicable remark made by Trump or one of his supporters during this election cycle and it should cost the GOP dearly in November.
