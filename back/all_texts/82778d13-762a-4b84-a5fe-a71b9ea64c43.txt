Yeah okay Kanye Noted jacka$$ Kanye West doesn t want white publications to write about his music anymore.
They just don t get it.And this isn t racist at all.The Huffington Post reported:On a far too cold Thursday afternoon in New York City last week, Kanye West finally debuted his album, The Life Of Pablo, at Madison Square Garden to over 20 million people tuning into a live stream on Tidal.Then he announced on Twitter that the album he previewed wasn t the album.At the end of the week, on Saturday Night Live, West eventually announced he had put the real album online.
But even then TLOP was just on Tidal.
Although it s unclear whether the album currently streaming on Tidal is the final version, publications such as The New York Times and Pitchfork put out their reviews just shortly after the release Then, after letting that rack up retweets and hearts for about half an hour, West decided to go after white publications that try to review black music.
Via: Gateway Pundit Since White publications shouldn t cover black music, does that mean White billionaires, like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, shouldn t cover the debts of black musicians?
