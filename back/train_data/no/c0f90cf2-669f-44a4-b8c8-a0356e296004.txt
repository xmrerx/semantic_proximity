zurich ( reuters ) - switzerland will return to nigeria around $ 321 million in assets seized from the family of former military ruler sani abacha via a deal signed with the world bank on monday , the swiss government said .
transparency international , a corruption watchdog , has accused abacha of stealing up to $ 5 billion of public money during the five years he ran the oil-rich country , from 1993 until his death in 1998 .
in 2014 , nigeria and the abacha family reached an agreement for the west african country to get back the funds , which had been frozen , in return for dropping a complaint against the former military ruler s son , abba abacha .
the son was charged by a swiss court with money-laundering , fraud and forgery in april 2005 , after being extradited from germany , and later spent 561 days in custody .
in 2006 , luxembourg ordered that funds held by the younger abacha be frozen .
now switzerland , nigeria and the world bank have agreed the funds will be repatriated via a project supported and overseen by the world bank , the swiss government said .
the project will strengthen social security for the poorest sections of the nigerian population .
the agreement also regulates the disbursement of restituted funds in tranches and sets out concrete measures to be taken in the event of misuse or corruption , it added .
