WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday lawmakers and the Trump administration were “on a path” toward reaching a deal on a bill that would keep the government funded beyond Dec. 8.
“That job will have to be done by December the eighth, and I think we’re on a path to do that,” McConnell told reporters, without providing any details.
