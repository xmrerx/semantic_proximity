You don t want to miss this!Here s a little info about Joe Dan Gorman and his website, Intellectual Froglegs.
You can find his website by clicking HERE.
My name is Joe Dan Gorman, and you can blame me for Intellectual Froglegs.
I created it, I write & produce it and I host it.
So, it s pretty much my fault.In case you haven t seen it yet the basis of Froglegs is to be covertly educational with humor, wicked cool graphics and classic tunage.And we re not following the media narrative or chasing the media-driven outrage of the day - but we will talk about things that matter, from the historical to the hysterical.I have no allegiance to a political party my allegience is to God, truth and freedom .
Oh, and funny stuff.
LOLThe best part I get to ridicule liberals, atheists and other assorted anti-American jackasses.
How fun.The most flattering compliment I get is when someone asks me to thank my staff but as far as the writing, editing, researching and production of the show I m it.
I also do all the website work.I ll steal jokes like a democrat, LOL Now there is nothing more important than God, so I invite you to enjoy some of the cool videos ay my God, Science & History page.
Nobody quite articulates the incomprehensibly massive power of God like a physicist.
God of Wonders is one of my favorites.You can help Joe Dan who runs an AD-FREE website by donating here: DONATE BUTTON Look for regular installments of Joe Dan Gorman s videos on our website.
We found his videos by chance and have fallen in love with his honest and ball-crushing humor.
We feel blessed to call him our buddy and hope you will find him as refreshing and hysterical as we do.ENJOY!
