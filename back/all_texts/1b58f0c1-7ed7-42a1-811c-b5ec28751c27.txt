JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s Justice Minister Michael Masutha on Friday denied parole to the killer of anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani, saying he had not expressed remorse for the murder.
Janusz Walus has served more than 20 years of a life sentence for the assassination of Hani, who was a senior member of the now-ruling African National Congress (ANC) and head of the South African Communist Party.
Walus, 64, emigrated from communist Poland in 1981 and became involved in far-right politics in South Africa.
He shot Hani outside the anti-apartheid activist s home in 1993.
The killing triggered nationwide riots that threatened to derail South Africa s 1994 transition to multi-racial democracy after decades of white apartheid rule.
Masutha also blocked Walus parole application in 2015, a decision that triggered several court challenges.
The Supreme Court of Appeal referred the matter back to the justice minister for reconsideration.
Masutha said on Friday a psychologist s report had highlighted Walus political ideology as a risk factor.
The report said Walus expressed remorse for the fact that the victim s children are fatherless and the wife is a widow .
However, he showed no remorse for murdering Chris Hani.
He still rationalizes his actions and insists that they were politically motivated.
His ideas about communism still stand.
