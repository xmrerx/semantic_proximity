the clinton campaign just managed to commit the biggest blunder of the presidential race yet !
bill needs a hobby !
he s not helping hillary on the campaign trail .
he had a finger wagging moment with some black lives matter folks and now this ! the media are protecting the clinton campaign , as usual .
according to the mainstream narrative , voters are supposed to believe that donald trump presents a mortal danger to american foreign policy because of a penchant to say stupid and reckless things .
yet it is the clinton campaign that has said something so outrageous that the prime minister of a faithful ally is demanding an apology , as is the foreign minister of another , and two domestic ethnic voting blocs are up in arms.it all began a week ago yesterday , when bill clinton said something outrageous at a clinton campaign rally in new jersey : former us president bill clinton said that poland and hungary have now decided democracy is too much trouble , therefore they want putin-like leadership .
the former us president was speaking about the central european countries to offer some comparison to republican candidate and hillary s potential rival donald trump .
just give me an authoritarian dictatorship and keep the foreigners out , sound familiar ?
, clinton said .
hungary and poland would not be free today without the united states and the long cold war , he insisted .
