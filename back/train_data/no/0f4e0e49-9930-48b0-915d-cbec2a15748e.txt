caracas ( reuters ) - venezuelan state elections may be repeated in the five states won by the opposition if the governors-elect continue to refuse to be sworn in by a controversial pro-government legislative superbody , president nicolas maduro warned on friday .
his warning came in a televised speech after the government on sunday unexpectedly won 18 of 23 states in a vote which the opposition calls fraudulent .
authorities have mandated that all elected governors participate in a ceremony before the pro-government constituent assembly , but the five opposition winners did not take part .
anyone who wants to be governor will have to recognize the constituent national assembly ; otherwise elections will be repeated in states where the assembly is not recognized , maduro said at the inauguration of one of the socialist candidates in western lara state .
the opposition says that by law , the oath must be taken before regional parliaments and not before the constituent assembly , but so far none of their candidates have undergone that process and formally assumed their roles .
venezuela s opposition leaders have said they would travel abroad to denounce what they call dirty tricks by the government and outright fraud in the minerals-rich state of bolivar .
maduro says the opposition cries fraud whenever it loses elections and that venezuela s electoral system is the most secure in the world .
