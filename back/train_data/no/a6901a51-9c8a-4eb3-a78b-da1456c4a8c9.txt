guatemala city ( reuters ) - guatemala s congress on monday voted to preserve president jimmy morales s immunity from prosecution after the attorney general s office submitted a request to investigate him over suspected financing irregularities during his 2015 election campaign .
attorney general thelma aldana and a u.n. anti-graft body said last month they were seeking to investigate morales over the illegal financing allegation .
two days later , morales declared the head of the u.n. body persona non grata .
under the leadership of ivan velasquez , a veteran colombian prosecutor , the cicig has caused problems for morales , first investigating his son and brother , and then seeking to prosecute him over some $ 800,000 in allegedly unexplained campaign funds .
the guatemalan president won office in 2015 running on a platform of honest governance after his predecessor , otto perez molina , was forced to resign and imprisoned in a multi-million dollar graft case stemming from a cicig investigation .
morales , a former comedian , has denied any wrongdoing .
