nice job adam baldwin .
we commend you for standing up to the highly successful , black multi-millionaires jada pinkett-smith , her husband will smith and director spike lee who , much like al sharpton never lets the opportunity to start a good race war go to waste ever since the motion picture academy announced the nominees for the 2016 oscars , there have been some heated discussions on social media regarding the diversity or lack thereof displayed by the academy s choices.nowhere has this been more apparent than twitter , where # oscarssowhite has become an ongoing trend .
it recently led to a dustup between full metal jacket alum adam baldwin and ironman actor don cheadle .
via : ijrhere is the first joke dig at the academy award show by cheadle : @ chrisrock yo , chris .

they got me parking cars on g level .
don cheadle ( @ doncheadle ) january 17 , 2016baldwin responded : https : //twitter.com/adambaldwin/status/688841370853740544then cheadle responded to baldwin : @ adambaldwin @ chrisrock nope .
don cheadle ( @ doncheadle ) january 18 , 2016then baldwin asks cheadle a legitimate question : https : //twitter.com/adambaldwin/status/688898296006352896to which cheadle responds with an incoherent answer : @ adambaldwin @ chrisrock only the legitimacy of the phrase and complete and obvious truth of it .
don cheadle ( @ doncheadle ) january 18 , 2016but when baldwin challenged the one-time oscar nominee https : //twitter.com/adambaldwin/status/688916800579354624cheadle then decided to twist the conversation around @ adambaldwin @ chrisrock the phrase oscarsowhite , dumb dumb .
not the show .
you 're a lazy reader .
don cheadle ( @ doncheadle ) january 20 , 2016at which time baldwin slays cheadle with facts : https : //twitter.com/adambaldwin/status/689889591940100099and in typical liberal fashion , academy award winner don cheadle ran away with his tail between his legs .
like a garlic to a vampire , the left is always ready to defend victimhood until the facts come out and then they head for the hills .
