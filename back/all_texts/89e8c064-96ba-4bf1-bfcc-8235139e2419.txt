After hearing Katie Couric s recent interview with Alec Baldwin and, of course, watching Saturday Night Live, one of Trump s idiot supporters decided to stroll on over to Alec Baldwin s Twitter timeline and start trolling.
What he didn t expect was that Baldwin would take a moment to mock him.
Do you think Hollywood will give equal time to conservative opinions, or continue your Apartide?
@lighthouselloyd tweeted at Alec Baldwin and Couric.

lloyd (@lighthouselloyd) January 15, 2017Now, Lloyd here probably thought he was demonstrating some smarts with what appears to be an accusation that Baldwin and Couric are murdering white people (it s hard to tell because Trump s people don t exactly know what words mean, but the idea that whites are facing unprecedented discrimination and attempts to eliminate them is popular with Trump voters).In any case, like Trump, Lloyd decided to ignore the red squiggly text that appears under improperly spelled words (like apartide ) to inform you that you re making yourself look like an idiot.
Naturally, Lloyd got schooled by Baldwin and his fans:@ABFalecbaldwin @lighthouselloyd @katiecouric "Apartide" is the only detergent that sorts your lights and darks for you!

elizabeth baldwin (@lizziejobaldwin) January 15, 2017Responding to Lloyd s remark that this week s hilarious Saturday Night Live was boring and flat, Baldwin continued trolling him in true Alec Baldwin style: @lighthouselloyd @katiecouricI find you stimulating, Lloyd.
ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 15, 2017You ve got to love Alec Baldwin.
He s the sort of guy who can make you hate yourself for being so stupid with minimal effort.
Recently, he managed to infuriate Trump supporters just by wearing a hat, for example.When will Trump supporters learn that expressing their thoughts in public only reveals that they are too stupid to express their thoughts in public?Watch Baldwin s performance on SNL below in case you missed it:Featured image via screengrab
