Rep. Tim Ryan (D. Ohio) had launched a bid to unseat Pelosi as House minority leader, arguing that the Democratic Party needs a new message and new messenger.
He has said after the election that the Democratic Party is no longer a national party, only representing the coasts and ignoring Middle America, which turned out in support of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.The old guard in the Democrat Party is hanging on and just won t let go.
Pelosi has had a gaffe-filled year so 2017 should be pretty interesting with Republicans in charge.
Pelosi unhinged in 2017?
