Seth Meyers takes his A Closer Look segment to destroy President Donald Trump and his Press Secretary Sean Spicer.
Meyers found more examples of stupidity on behalf of the White House, including a reference to something George W. Bush said that clearly went over the president s head.
Bush said that the Oval Office is that shape to have no corners to hide in.
He also brought up a recent interview Trump did with John Dickerson, of CBS s Face the Nation.
Trump referred to the show as Deface the Nation.
While calling news outlets he doesn t like is not anything new, this was the first time he did it to the reporter s face and while taping an interview for the show in question.The comedian wasn t done there.
He also eviscerated the performance of the press secretary who seems to make less and less sense in his daily press briefings.
Despite Spicer s claims, the new border fence was paid for by previous administrations.
