An Atlanta Democrat makes some very valid points on what America needs to become better.
She believes that Trump is her candidate.
It s so interesting because this woman is not a Republican.
Trump gives me real hope and change, not fake hope and change.
I m voting for America because I believe in America.
I never thought I d be saying these words about the country.
Democrats don t speak about the country but I ve woken up, I ve seen the truth and the truth is Trump, I believe in this guy to make our country better because our country is going to hell!
My daughter can t find a job, she s a college graduate.
Black men are 50% unemployed.
Our borders are wide open.
I love everybody don t get me wrong, but we have to close our borders.
Trump is speaking the truth and that is why I m here.
The woman went on to add that, Democrats are crazy I can t believe I thought that way.
She said her husband supports Bernie Sanders and that she told him, If he don t vote for Trump, we re getting a divorce.
