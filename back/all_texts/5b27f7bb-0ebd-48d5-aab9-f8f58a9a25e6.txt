Donald Trump is soon going to be unleashing even more fake news attacks on the media than ever before.It turns out that former President Barack Obama s Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, just got a new job and it s definitely going to piss the entire Trump administration off.
While most Americans miss seeing Earnest s press briefings especially because he s been replaced by pathetic Sean Spicer we will now be able to see him speak regularly as a political contributor for NBC News and MSNBC!NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin made this announcement on Monday, and it s clear that they couldn t be happier with Earnest joining the team, considering his extensive political experience under Obama.
The memo they circulated this morning said: We are pleased to announce that Josh Earnest will join NBC News and MSNBC as a Political Analyst.
As you may have seen, he made his debut this morning on Today and Morning Joe.
Josh recently completed a ten-year run with President Obama, most recently serving as White House Press Secretary from 2014-2017.Josh joined the Obama presidential campaign in March 2007 as the Iowa communications director, and went on to serve as deputy communications director during the 2008 general election.
Josh has also worked on numerous national, statewide and local campaigns over the course of his twenty years in politics.
As expected, Earnest s debut was nothing but epic, and it s just what we would expect from the former Press Secretary after working closely with Obama for so many years.
Earnest marked his first day in his new role in NBC s Today, where he didn t hesitate to talk about what a massive failure Trump was and how pathetic the GOP s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was.You can watch Earnest s debut here:Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr
