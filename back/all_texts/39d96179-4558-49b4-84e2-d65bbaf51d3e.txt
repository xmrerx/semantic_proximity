Susan Rice and Obama were as thick as thieves during his 8 years as president.
In the video below, Rice lies about the spying on Trump without blinking an eye.
These people are ruthless in their desire destroy President Trump.Here is Susan Rice a couple months ago claiming Trump's wiretapping claims are completely FALSE.
She even says a FISA warrant would be needed to do something like that..What a LYING sack of trash.

Do you know anything about this?SUSAN RICE, Former U.S. National Security Adviser: I know nothing about this.
I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today.
And let`s back up and recall where we have been.
The president of the United States accused his predecessor, President Obama, of wiretapping Trump Tower during the campaign.
Nothing of the sort occurred, and we have heard that confirmed by the director of the FBI, who also pointed out that no president, no White House can order the surveillance of another American citizen.
That can only come from the Justice Department, with the approval of a FISA court.
