beijing ( reuters ) - cultural exchanges between countries need to consider the temperature of popular opinion and how people feel about each other , a senior chinese official said on friday , amid a freeze in cultural ties with south korea over an anti-missile system .
china has been angered by seoul s decision to deploy the u.s.-made terminal high altitude area defense ( thaad ) system , saying that its powerful radar harms china s own national security and will do nothing to lessen tensions with north korea , which thaad is supposed to defend against .
popular south korean soap operas have been pulled from streaming sites , k-pop singers have had concerts canceled and there has been a dramatic drop in chinese tourists to south korea .
china has not officially linked the moves to the thaad tensions , but has said relations need to have a basis in popular opinion .
asked about the prospects for cultural exchanges with south korea amid the thaad dispute , deputy media regulator zhang hongsen said cultural exchanges were not an ordinary exchange of goods .
cultural exchanges relate to where the popular will inclines and to emotional choices , he said , speaking on the sidelines of a communist party congress .
so what we say is that culture exchanges are an exchange of temperatures , and this temperature comes from popular feeling and emotion , added zhang , who is a vice minister of the state administration of press , publication , radio , film and television .
when popular sentiments and emotions align , cultural exchanges and cooperation can certainly develop in a positive direction , he said , without elaborating .
