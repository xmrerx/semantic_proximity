taipei ( reuters ) - taiwan has appointed as premier william lai , the mayor of its southern city of tainan , president tsai ing-wen said on tuesday , as she moved to shore up declining public support .
a reshuffle to replace the premier had been anticipated for months as tsai s approval ratings dropped below 30 percent by august , a private foundation survey showed , from nearly 70 percent soon after her 2016 inauguration .
we have a clear direction for our reforms , tsai told a news briefing .
premier lai will lead the administrative team , iron out any problems , and take us forward .
lai s appointment comes a day after the resignation of lin chuan , the premier since tsai took office in may 2016 .
frozen ties with china , a massive power outage in the tech hub for apple inc and other global firms , a backlash over pension reforms and a revised labor rule , are among the controversies that put pressure on tsai to replace lin , as she prepares for her 2020 re-election campaign .
lai , a harvard graduate , was a lawmaker for four consecutive terms and a whip of tsai s democratic progressive party ( dpp ) caucus before becoming in 2010 the mayor of tainan , home to the plants of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co ( tsmc ) and other technology firms .
i ll redouble our efforts to reform and transform , for the benefit of the people of taiwan , lai said .
however , lai s premiership would not necessarily help the president improve her ratings , some analysts have said .
