Speaking to a bunch of his merry morons on Monday, Donald Trump decided to say that veterans who have post-traumatic stress after war commit suicide because they just can t handle it.Trump, the drafter dodger, decided to say this about folks with PTSD: When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over and you re strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can t handle it.
They see horror stories, they see events you couldn t see in a movie, nobody would believe it.
First of all, if Trump needs to talk about who has a mental health problem, he should just look in the mirror to see a clear narcopath.
However, I m sure he s the best narcopath ever.Secondly, he needs to STFU about Veterans and PTSD.
Like, right now.
To say it s just because they can t handle it and that s why they commit suicide or have a lot of struggles isn t just woefully naive, it s absolutely insulting to our men and women who have laid their life on the line for this country.However, not letting Trump get away with being the ass that he is, Patton Oswalt took to Twitter to do what he does best, roast the a**hole.Oswalt tweeted out:Hey @realDonaldTrump: Good luck with your PTSD after Hillary stomps your dick in the dirt on Nov. 8th.
