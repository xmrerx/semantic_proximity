this call to violence by the left against innocent people who don t agree with their radical ideology , is eerily similar to the tactics used by terror groups in the middle east .
these are acts of terror that are being overlooked by our president and our doj , simply because they understand that this is the only way to stop trump is by striking fear in the hearts of his supporters a picture of a flier that s been circulating in the richmond , va area is going viral .
the intent of this flier is clearly to stir up hate and encourage violence against trump supporters who plan to attend trump s upcoming rally .
this type of organization to create chaos and fear is how the left wins elections , how the unions get what they want and how our president and his cronies operate behind closed doors at our white house .
this flier is laced with hate , fear mongering and calls to violence , but you will never see it being shown to the general public by the mainstream media , as it crushes their narrative that the trump supporters and conservatives of america are somehow promoting violence and fear mongering to get votes .
this incendiary flier is summarized at the bottom by claiming , they [ trump supporters ] have promised us violence , and we must promise them the same .
can someone please provide us with one iota of evidence that shows trump supporters asking other supporters to violently attack innocent people who disagree with their political views ? america needs to stand up to these coordinated efforts by talking to their neighbors , relatives , friends , co-workers and even to members of their churches .
sunlight is the best disinfectant .
if the media won t report this , we need to speak up and let everyone know what is happening h/t weasel zippers
