with only 357 delegates to go for trump to cinch the nomination , does this news present a public relations nightmare for the republican establishment ?
republican national committee member randy evans said wednesday that donald trump would likely be able to secure the republican nomination if he captures anything more than 1,100 delegates , short of the 1,237 delegates needed for a simple majority .
if donald trump exceeds 1,100 votes , he will become the nominee even though he may not have 1,237 , evans said on msnbc s morning joe .

member randy evans : if @ realdonaldtrump exceeds 1100 votes , he will become the nominee https : //t.co/nmewhf5fft morning joe ( @ morning_joe ) april 13 , 2016evans comment is good news for trump if it s a sentiment shared by other rnc members , since trump is at risk of falling short of a majority of delegates by the time of the convention in july .
but evans also warned that if trump slips much more , the nomination would likely fall to someone else .
if he gets less than 1,000 delegates , then i think we re looking at a contested convention that could go on for many , many days , evans said.as of this week , trump leads cruz in the delegate race 743-545 , but he s expected to pick up most of new york s delegates next week , and has polled well in other states whose primaries are approaching .
