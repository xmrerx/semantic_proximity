twitter s pitch deck for rt ? 21st century wire says in what appears to be a coordinated attack on rt and sputnik , twitter ceo jack dorsey ( @ jack ) has declared all advertising purchased by the two media outlets unfit for the online news and social networking service.off-boarding advertising from all accounts owned by russia today ( rt ) and sputnik.we re donating all projected earnings ( $ 1.9mm ) to support external research into the use of twitter in elections , including use of malicious automation and misinformation .
