There have been many musical artists who have demanded that Donald Trump cease and desist using their tunes to rile up the crowds at his campaign rallies, and the lead guitarist for the iconic rock band Queen, Brian May, has just become the latest.
May found out that Trump had used the Queen hit We are the Champions at an event, and immediately spoke out, saying to fans who made him aware of Trump s use of Queen s songs: I will make sure we take what steps we can to dissociate ourselves from Donald Trump s unsavoury campaign.
He also says that as a matter of policy that Queen does not usually allow their music to be used by politicians, period, and wrote on his own personal website: This is not an official Queen statement, but I can confirm that permission to use the track was neither sought nor given.
We are taking advice on what steps we can take to ensure this use does not continue.
Regardless of our views on Mr Trump s platform, it has always been against our policy to allow Queen music to be used as a political campaigning tool.
Our music embodies our own dreams and beliefs, but it is for all who care to listen and enjoy.
Just a little while ago, REM s music was used by Trump, and the response from former lead singer Michael Stipe was nothing short of delicious: Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men.
Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.
In other words, rock stars don t want a damn thing to do with Donald Trump.
He really better be careful, because he s going to wind up with even more lawsuits and legal trouble than he already has.
Face it, Donald the only musician who wants you using his music is Ted Nugent, and that s really not saying much at all.
Keep it up, and you ll piss off all of Hollywood, and that is DEFINITELY not something you want to do.Featured image via Jordi Vidal/Getty Images
