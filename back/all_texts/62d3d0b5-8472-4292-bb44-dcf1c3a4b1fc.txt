Of course, this happened in Florida.After reportedly failing to convince a man to support Donald Trump during a heated argument at a polling place in a Lake Worth church, a Trump supporter resorted to pulling a gun on him.Palm Beach County Sheriff s deputies responded to the incident and promptly arrested the Trump supporter, who was seen wearing his Make America Great Again hat as he was being placed in the back of a police cruiser.A witness said the Trump supporter got into an argument with the voter after he refused to vote for Trump.Here s some images of the man being taken into custody via Facebook.With the results of the election only hours away, one has to wonder if incidents like this will explode across the country if Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton.After all, Trump supporters have repeatedly threatened bloody violence, including assassination attempts and a coup in retaliation if their side loses.And since Donald Trump has repeatedly called the election rigged and has refused to say that he would concede if he loses, we can only wait and see how the results unfold and watch the reaction.Voting should be a safe civic activity for every person in this country.
Pulling a firearm just because another voter does not share your choice of candidate is uncivilized and damages the democratic process.
Polling places should be safe spaces no matter how much we disagree with each other.This is one of the nastiest elections in American history and it may end up being one of the most violent.
That s what Trump and his deplorable supporters have done this year.
And it s absolutely disgraceful.Featured Image: Facebook
