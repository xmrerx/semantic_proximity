cnn reported that they declined to expose a private citizen who made the wwe video of president trump wrestling with a cnn logo if the guy promises not to do it again : cnn reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change .
this is blackmail right ? # fraudnewscnn # fnn pic.twitter.com/wyunhjjujg donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 2 , 2017 the hysterical video has been seen over 1 million times after it was tweeted out by president trump .
it was produced by a reddit user who is private : soon after the cnn statement , twitter was abuzz over the fact that cnn was extorting this private citizen : donald trump jr retweeted the threat : congressman scott taylor tweeted out : @ cnn u basically coerce apology & threaten release of identity if something changes ?
pretty sure a line is crossed here .
