FBI Director James Comey met with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday to discuss Donald Trump s claim that former President Obama had his wires tapped at Trump Tower during the election.
A day later, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee said that he hasn t seen one shred of evidence to back up Trump s bogus claim.Rep.
Adam Schiff is a member of what is known as the Gang of Eight, which is the group of House members who are privy to the most classified information out there.
Schiff said that Thursday s meeting with Comey didn t provide the committee with any evidence whatsoever that Trump s phones had been tapped by Obama or anyone else.
I think when Sean Spicer isn t even willing to talk about it, you know there s a real problem, Schiff told CNN.Rep.
Devin Nunes, who is the Republican heading up the intelligence committee, said earlier this week that he hadn t seen any evidence to support Trump s wiretapping claims either.
After meeting with Comey, he said that nothing had changed.Comey has said previously that Trump is full of it when it comes to the allegations of his phones being tapped.
Schiff thinks Comey will answer questions regarding this fiasco during a committee hearing scheduled for later this month.
He certainly is prepared for the question, Schiff told CNN.
I don t see any reason why he wouldn t answer it.
He might even welcome the opportunity.
Trump decided last weekend that he would get on Twitter and accuse Obama of tapping the phones at Trump Tower, even if he had no evidence to back up this allegation.Terrible!
Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory.
Nothing found.
This is McCarthyism!

This is Nixon/Watergate.
Bad (or sick) guy!
