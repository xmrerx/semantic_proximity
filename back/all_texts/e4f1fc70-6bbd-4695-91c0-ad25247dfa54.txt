Donald Trump is not a detail person.
Learning about issues is apparently below his pay grade, as is spelling, at least if you look at his latest attempt to attack Hillary Clinton.On Friday night, Trump tweeted this:Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016Do you notice it?
Well, there are three, maybe four, things, actually.
He misspelled loose, judgment and instincts.
In that might be grammatically okay, but it s still awkward.The problem with a campaign that s being run almost entirely on Twitter, is that most people reading the tweets also have Twitter accounts and they are quick to jump on tweets like Trump.
They didn t let us down.
Here are just a few of the responses: .
@realDonaldTrump you ll have to do some editing to get this under 140 again but the mistakes were too bad to ignore pic.twitter.com/c7CDhCVLD2 shrillary tintin (@theshrillest) July 30, 2016.
@realDonaldTrumpQuick spelling lesson: Lose = opposite of win Loose = your mom Matthew Inman (@Oatmeal) July 30, 2016 @SheilaInCT @realDonaldTrump nah, every time he speaks he embarrasses himself What s a few more typos?
The Nostra Thomas (@TomTrudeau) July 30, 2016@realDonaldTrump How s the spelling going over there, big cheeto?
Andrew W Chamings (@AndrewChamings) July 30, 2016 @Norsemen83 @_NeverTrump Sorry, I honestly thought this tweet was a joke.
Trump has the insight and intellect of a angry 11 year old boy Andrew W Chamings (@AndrewChamings) July 30, 2016@realDenaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Dirty Don, you ve got the best words!
Unfortunately you can t spell them.
You ve become a national joke!

Hillary For America (@_NeverTrump) July 30, 2016This isn t the first time Trump has been ridiculed for gawdawful spelling in his tweets.
Even the conservative Daily Caller mocked the Republican candidate for his spelling that would be bad if he were in middle school.
And then, there was this back in February.If you think about it, proper spelling is probably low on the list of presidential qualifications, but this is a sign of something much more dangerous.
This is a time when Trump should be putting his best, most professional face forward, and his sloppiness is an indication that he s really not ready to lead the country.
He s impetuous and, in fact, he s the lose cannon.
We need a president who thinks before speaking, and the fact that Trump can t even be bothered to run his tweets through a spell checker shows that he has no intention of taking professionalism with him to the White House.Featured image via Sara D. Davis at Getty Images.
