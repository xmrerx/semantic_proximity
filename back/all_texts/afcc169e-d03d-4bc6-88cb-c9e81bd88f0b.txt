Senator Rand Paul appeared on Bill Hemmer s Fox News show to discuss the importance of fighting the FISA law, to prevent the US government from unlawful spying and collection of information on Americans.With tax reform a done-deal and the wind at his back, Senator Rand Paul came out swinging against the Obama administration.Paul said he wants answers as to why Mueller s investigation into alleged Trump-Russia collusion appears so obviously partisan.
You have the Department of Justice, where you have a high-ranking official whose wife works for the group doing opposition research on Trump being paid for by the Democrat National Committee, that sounds like a lot of high-ranking people colluding to try to prevent Donald Trump from being president, Paul told Fox News Bill Hemmer from the Hill on Thursday.I'm never a fan of shutting down government so that's not my intention.
I am a fan of defending the bill of rights, though.
