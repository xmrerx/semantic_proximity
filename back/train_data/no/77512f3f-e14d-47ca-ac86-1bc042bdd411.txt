phoenix ( reuters ) - arizona ’ s governor signed into law on friday a bitterly contested proposal that will restore a federal health insurance program for children from low-income families , making it the last of its 49 counterparts to join the program .
arizona opted out of the federal children ’ s health insurance program in 2010 over cost concerns as it grappled with a budget crunch .
the program aims to help working families who earn too much to qualify for medicaid health care coverage for the poor , but who can not afford private health insurance .
to qualify for kidscare , as it ’ s known in arizona , a family of four must earn between $ 33,000 and $ 49,000 annually .
it is estimated to serve about 30,000 children in arizona .
arizona ’ s republican governor , doug ducey , signed the legislation over fierce objections from the top two lawmakers in his own party a matter of hours after it cleared the republican-led legislature .
the debate over the program was among the most rancorous of the legislative session and focused on both costs and the fact that the measure was tacked on to a virtually unrelated school voucher bill , prompting concerns that the law would face a legal challenge .
backers said the program is desperately needed to close a gap in affordable health insurance options and to ensure that children are able to grow up healthy .
even though the state is no longer required under the program to contribute funds in exchange for federal dollars , as was the case in 2010 , opponents argued that arizona citizens are still indirectly financing the program by paying for the program through federal taxes .
arizona ’ s house of representatives approved the measure on thursday following heated debate .
the law could take effect as early as august .
