( reuters ) - the u.s. supreme court on friday refused to stay a ruling that two north carolina congressional districts be redrawn over racial gerrymandering in a 2011 redistricting , forcing congressional primaries to be rescheduled for june 7 .
a lower court panel of federal judges this month barred elections in the majority black districts , the 1st and the 12th , until new maps are approved , calling the current maps unconstitutional .
the supreme court gave no explanation for its decision in a one-sentence order issued late on friday night .
the ruling said race had been the main factor when the republican-controlled legislature redrew the boundaries and state lawmakers were not justified in using that benchmark .
three voters filed suit in 2013 to invalidate the districts .
both are represented by democrats , with g.k. butterfield in the 1st , and alma adams in the 12th .
the primaries for the state ’ s 13 u.s. house seats will be held on june 7 rather than march 15 after north carolina lawmakers agreed to move the date on thursday if the supreme court rejected the stay request .
the state ’ s presidential and gubernatorial primaries will still be held on march 15 .
broadcaster wral reported that while state lawmakers hoped for a stay , legislators in the state ’ s house on friday moved ahead and gave final approval to newly-drafted congressional maps ahead of the court ’ s decision to reject the stay request .
politico reported that justice antonin scalia had been expected to vote in favor of staying the ruling before his death last saturday , though it was not immediately clear how his death affected the court ’ s decision .
