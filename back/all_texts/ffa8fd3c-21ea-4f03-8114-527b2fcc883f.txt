Donald Trump s hateful, divisive rhetoric brought out the worst in Americans during his presidential campaign and now that the reality television star and scammy business mogul has been elected as President of the Unites States, his supporters are letting their true colors shine freely.America s future leader spent over a year normalizing bigotry, discrimination, and violence, and now we re seeing a massive increase in hate crimes and attacks across America.
And it turns out, not even the country s most well-known and respected individuals are safe.
Recently, Golden Globe-nominated actress Emmy Rossum spoke out about the recent anti-Semitic attacks she s been getting from Trump supporters since the election, and it s enough to make your stomach turn.
If anyone is still trying to convince you that Trump isn t the modern-day Adolf Hitler, you need to show them what Rossum endured at the hands of these monsters.On Sunday, Rossum fought back and called out Trump and his supporters for their hate speech:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitter No matter WHO you voted for, I don t care, THIS is not okay.

It is hard to believe that this is the country that was once considered progressive and accepting of all individuals.
It s clear that Trump is making good on his promise to return our country to earlier times in history, where white people ruled everyone else.Rossum pointed out this sad phenomenon perfectly when she remarked that perhaps America was naive about how far we d come, and maybe this brand of hatred had been there all along, just waiting to be awakened by the right kind of dictator.
It is terrifying and upsetting to come to terms with the fact that the America we ve been living in is such a divisive, unwelcoming place now.TwitterFeatured image via Alberto E. Rodriguez and Zach Gibson/Getty Images
