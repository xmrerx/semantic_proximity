tarragona , spain ( reuters ) - the catalonian government on thursday launched its official campaign for an independence referendum , which madrid has declared illegal , buoyed by the support of the capital barcelona .
crowds filled a bull ring in the northeastern city of tarragona , applauding and shouting we will vote !
as regional president carles puigdemont arrived to rally support for the oct. 1 vote .
in a boost for the credibility of the referendum , the mayor of barcelona said earlier on thursday that the vote would go ahead in the city , having previously expressed concern that civil servants involved may lose their jobs .
a town hall spokesman was unable to comment further or explain how civil servants could be protected .
puigdemont himself is facing criminal charges of misuse of public money , disobedience and abuse of office for organizing the referendum , and prosecutors have summoned hundreds of the region s mayors for questioning .
police raided a newspaper office and a printing press last week , looking for signs of preparation , and the regional court has ordered civil guard agents to shut down web pages providing information about the referendum .
regional home affairs councillor joaquim forn said there was a bigger than usual presence of national police in catalonia .
they are moving throughout the region .
they must be looking for ballot boxes , he told rac1 radio .
a majority of catalonia s 5.5 million voters want to have their say on the northeastern region s relationship with spain , but the independence cause has lost support in recent years and surveys indicate less than 50 percent of the population would choose full self-rule .
