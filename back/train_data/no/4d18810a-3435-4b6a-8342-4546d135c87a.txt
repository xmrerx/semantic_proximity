hong kong ( reuters ) - hong kong s highest court granted bail to two prominent young pro-democracy activists , joshua wong and nathan law , on tuesday pending an appeal over their jail terms for unlawful assembly linked to the city s mass pro-democracy protests in 2014 .
hong kong s appeals court jailed wong , 21 , law , 24 and alex chow , 27 , leaders of the chinese-ruled city s democracy movement , in august .
their sentencing came as a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompted accusations of political interference .
the trio helped lead the largely peaceful umbrella movement that blocked major roads for 79 days in 2014 , demanding beijing grant hong kong full democracy .
hong kong has been governed under a one country , two systems formula since its return from british to chinese rule in 1997 , allowing freedoms not enjoyed on mainland china that include an independent judiciary .
hong kong chief justice geoffrey ma , who heads the court of final appeal , granted wong and law bail of hk $ 50,000 ( $ 6,408 ) each while they appeal against their respective six-month and eight-month jail terms .
there s no flight risk , ma told the court .
chow did not apply for bail .
ma said a court of final appeal hearing would be held on nov. 7 to consider the trio s applications for appeal .
the next legal steps will likely be scrutinised closely , with the jailings having shaken confidence in hong kong s vaunted rule of law .
wong , chow and law were sentenced last year to community service for unlawful assembly .
however , reuters reported that justice secretary rimsky yuen had overruled other senior colleagues to re-open the case and push for a harsher sentence that eventually led to their imprisonment .
a group of senior international lawyers recently issued a joint letter saying the jailings posed a serious threat to the city s rule of law .
