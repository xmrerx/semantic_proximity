Vile GOP Senator Tom Cotton made the mistake of facing his constituents on Wednesday, and things could not possibly have gone worse for him especially after one elderly woman whose healthcare he was trying to take away got ahold of him.
We re doing Medicare my way, not your way.
My way, the woman told Cotton, who was one of the Republican Senators who sent a letter vowing to undo Obama s Iran deal.
I ve got a husband dying and we can t afford let me tell you something, if you can get us better coverage than this go for it.
She then lays out the cost of her and her husband s current care: $29 for him and $39 for her rates that no GOP plan (they still have not presented an actual plan) could beat.
I have sent you one message after the other, sir, about our family, she told her Senator, chiding him for responding to her concerns with the same form letter every single time.
I live just down the road a few places from your office, and I have invited you into our home, and not a word, except a classic, regular letter sent.
Other attendees hammered Cotton for not taking a tougher stance on Russia and voiced a number of legitimate concerns.
While the response to Cotton s presence was largely negative, one woman told him that she thinks the majority in Arkansas support him.
She was met with a chorus of boos from the audience because no one likes Tom Cotton.Watch our heroine wreck Cotton s week below:Voter to @SenTomCotton: My husband is dying.
We can't afford health insurance.
What kind of insurance do you have?
