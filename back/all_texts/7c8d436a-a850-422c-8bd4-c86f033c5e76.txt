Apparently, West Virginia Democrat not to be confused with real Democrats Joe Manchin effectively told voter he doesn t want his job anymore when he was the only person supposedly on our side who voted to confirm lifetime racist and embarrassment to humanity Jeff Sessions as Attorney General.Manchin, who reportedly considered switching to Republican just after the 2016 election (though he denies it), has been on the wrong side of history many times in his career.
Not only did he vote with Republicans to terminate funding for Planned Parenthood after right-wing activists produced heavily-edited propaganda videos that claimed the women s health organization sells baby parts, but he is so deep in the pockets of the coal industry that the lint is jealous.
On top of that, Manchin has been endorsed by the NRA and has supported legislation that sought to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas.
While Manchin has been criticized for all of that in the past, his decision to support a career racist for Attorney General is bringing a sh*tstorm his way that he seems to have failed to anticipate.Shortly after the vote, Manchin s Wikipedia page underwent some renovations most notably the word traitor above his head and a note that he voted with republicans on the horrible Jeff Sessions :Manchin s decision to betray his party, his country and everything decent in the world is not going over well on social media, where pretty much everyone seems to want to set him adrift:@LoganPhares @JalyIV Stop calling yourself a Democrat, your not.
We don't support white supremacists.

#WhyIResist #ShePersisted Wendy R (@wlr96) February 9, 2017Republicans didn't need @Sen_JoeManchin's vote to approve Jeff Sessions, but he gave it to them as a big F-U to minorities.

Leave our party before we throw you out Jellokitty (@jellokitty5) February 9, 2017@womensmarch @janniaragon @Sen_JoeManchin We're coming for you in 2018 and all your GOP buddies.
Every seat.
Every chamber.
#RiseUp Roberta Greenwood (@RobertaG52) February 9, 2017According to Fortune, Trump and Manchin call each other directly on their cell phones, have met at Trump Tower and even flirted with the idea of a Cabinet post.
His chumminess with our dictator-in-chief alone is enough for Democrats to tell him to hit the bricks in 2018.
Everything else is just extra.
