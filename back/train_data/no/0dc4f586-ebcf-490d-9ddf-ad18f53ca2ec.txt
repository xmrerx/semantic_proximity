the finance ministry has provided 50 million pounds ( $ 66 million ) to help cover the cost of setting up the program , rudd said .
we are going to be testing and rolling it out in stages to make sure we get it right , rudd said .
we will be nimble on our toes ... to make sure we recruit where necessary to keep it up .
