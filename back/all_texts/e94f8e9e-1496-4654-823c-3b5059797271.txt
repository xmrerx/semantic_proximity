I m pretty sure Trump will win with a YUGE majority in New York without his kids votes.
Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump won t be voting for their father, Donald, in the New York primary next week.The deadline to register to vote in the Republican primary in New York was October 9, 2015.
Both Eric and Ivanka missed the deadline to register.
They had a long time [to] register and they were, you know, unaware of the rules, and they didn t, they didn t register in time, Trump stated during an interview on Fox News.
So they feel very, very guilty.
But it s fine, I mean, I understand that.
I think they have to register a year in advance and they didn t. So Eric and Ivanka I guess won t be voting, Trump added.
