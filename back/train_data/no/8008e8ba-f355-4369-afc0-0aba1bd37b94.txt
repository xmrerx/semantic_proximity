sydney ( reuters ) - australia said on tuesday it will introduce reforms by the end of the year to combat foreign interference and covert political influence , which could pose a threat to the economy and political system .
the decision to improve safeguards follows a review of australia s espionage and foreign interference laws and will include legislation to ban foreign political donations , attorney-general george brandis told parliament .
espionage and covert foreign interference can cause immense harm to our national sovereignty , to the safety of our people , to our economic prosperity , and to the very integrity of australian democracy , brandis said .
policies modeled in part on the u.s. foreign agents registration act , requiring individuals or institutions to make a declaration if acting on behalf of a foreign power to influence the political processes , would also be introduced , he said .
while brandis did not mention any countries targeted by the legislation , there has been growing concern about china extending its influence .
in june , australian broadcasting corporation and fairfax media , publisher of the sydney morning herald and the age newspapers , reported there had been a concerted campaign by china and its proxies to infiltrate the australian political process and institutions to promote their interests .
china dismissed the accusation as totally unfounded and irresponsible .
this week , one of australia s largest independent publishers said it decided to delay the publication of a book that alleges widespread chinese government influence in australian institutions due to legal concerns .
