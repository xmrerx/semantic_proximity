vienna ( reuters ) - austrian conservative leader sebastian kurz , who secured victory in sunday s parliamentary election but fell well short of a majority , does not rule out the possibility of forming a minority government once the final result comes in .
i would of course like to form a stable government .
if that can not be done then there are other options , he told broadcaster orf , adding that he planned to talk to all parties in parliament but would first wait for a count of postal ballots that begins on monday .
that count will settle the close race for second place between the social democrats and the far-right freedom party .
