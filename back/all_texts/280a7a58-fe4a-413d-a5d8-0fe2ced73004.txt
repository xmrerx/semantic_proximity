Donald Trump is visiting Detroit to promote his agenda of helping the black community.
Our good friend and awesome patriot Wayne Bradley has been working in the inner city Republican office for over two years in an effort to reach out to the black community.
Patty and I can t say enough great things about Wayne Bradley and his desire to succeed with the Republican party in Michigan in 2016 and beyond.
His hard work might be paying off TRUMP 2016!
