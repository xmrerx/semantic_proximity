I told him that I bought both of these tickets and he tells me that he got the ticket on standby.
Then he proceeds to sit in the center, Yamauchi told Hawaii News Now.Yamuachi says she tried to inform a flight attendant about Taizo s seat, but the woman claimed she couldn t do anything about it, seeing as the flight was full.Not wanting to cause a scene or worse, instigate an incident like the one that befell the elderly United passenger who refused to give up his seat on in April Yamuachi sat Taizo on her lap and kept her mouth shut until she reached Boston.
I started remembering all those incidents with United on the news.
The violence.
Teeth getting knocked out.
I m Asian.
I m scared and I felt uncomfortable.
I didn t want those things to happen to me, she told Hawaii News Now.Watch:Upon reaching Boston, Yamauchi was told to call a United hotline to explain the situation.
