Donald Trump is so deplorable that even Cthulhu wants nothing to do with him.The fictional evil creature created by H.P.
Lovecraft and his fans were quick to issue a denial after horror author Stephen King compared Cthulhu to Republican nominee Donald Trump on Monday.
Breaking News: Reliable sources reveal that Donald Trump is actually Cthulu, King wrote on Twitter.
The absurd hairdo isn t absurd at all.
It hides the tentacles.

Stephen King (@StephenKing) September 12, 2016And hilariously enough, Cthulhu responded in the comments by taking offense at being compared to Trump.
@StephenKing Sorry, Stephen, you couldn t be more wrong.
That clown has nothing on me.

(((TS Valle))) (@tattoosandbones) September 12, 2016 @StephenKing @dmalmon I don t see it.
Cthulhu has a coherent, if unspeakable, program.
Bill Cameron (@bcmystery) September 13, 2016@StephenKing That s offensive to our Lord and saviour ?
Roo Morgue (@roomorgue) September 12, 2016 @StephenKing @BlueRaveFinn No, he s nowhere near competent enough to be Cthulhu.
Evil-Yet-Amazingly-Stupid is not an Elder God trait.
James Petruzzi (@Hawaiianimages) September 12, 2016@StephenKing interesting hypothesis, but if he were Cthulhu at least he d offer a clearer future for America and less insanity.

Tom Dullemond (@Cacotopos) September 12, 2016Cthulhu then posted a statement on Twitter categorically distancing himself from Trump.
Trump could barely hope to be 1/63 as great as I am if he weren t such a buffoon, Cthulhu wrote, continuing by saying that Trump is an impulsive firestarter.
