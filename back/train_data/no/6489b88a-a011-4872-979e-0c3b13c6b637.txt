tel aviv ( reuters ) - thousands of israelis protested in tel aviv on saturday for the second consecutive week against government corruption and prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office .
police estimated the number of demonstrators at about 10,000 and they followed last saturday s demonstration , which was by far the largest of the recent weekly anti-corruption protests when an estimated 20,000 people participated .
the protests have been sparked by corruption allegations against netanyahu , who denies any wrongdoing .
the four-term leader is suspected of involvement in two cases .
the first involves receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen and the second involves negotiating a deal with a newspaper owner for better coverage in return for curbs on a rival daily .
if charged , he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate to govern .
netanyahu s right-wing likud party said in a facebook post that the protest was a left-wing demonstration .
it called on all israelis to back their prime minister as he defends israel against international criticism following u.s. president donald trump s acceptance of jerusalem as israel s capital .
instead of uniting with all the people behind jerusalem and showing the world a unified front , the left can not contain itself and it prefers to create division , part of the statement said .
over weeks of demonstrations , protesters have identified themselves as supporting both left- and right-wing parties .
on saturday they held banners reading : neither left , nor right ( we demand ) integrity , we are fed up with corrupt ( politicians ) and sweep the corrupt away .
