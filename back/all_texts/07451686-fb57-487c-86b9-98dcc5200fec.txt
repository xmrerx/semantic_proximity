WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Marine General Joseph Dunford to keep his post as his top military adviser for another two-year term.
Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was first named to the post in 2015 under then-president Barack Obama.
The Pentagon announced the decision in a statement on Friday.
