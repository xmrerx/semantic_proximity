As much as he and his supporters want to say the media is against Donald Trump, it s clearly not.
Trump has gotten a ridiculous amount of media attention, and it would be easy to say much more than any other candidate of either party.With this media attention comes an abundance of newspaper articles, blog posts and ledes to stories.
All with their own way to describe something Trump has said or done or is being scrutinized for.
Many of which are pretty straight-forward and bland, not really depicting Trump in a way that really embodies his true essence.Well, fixing this dilemma is none other than the extraordinary Rosie O Donnell who took to Twitter to retitle the news to more accurately depict Donald Trump.For example, Huffington Post titled an article, Judge Criticized By Trump Unseals Documents In Trump University Case, but Rosie kept it real and wrote: ORANGE PEOPLE STEAL MONEY FROM UNSUSPECTING INNOCENTS ORANGE PEOPLE STEAL MONEY FROM UNSUSPECTING INNOCENTS https://t.co/1988CJAPB4 via @HuffPostPol #DEPORTORANGEMAN Rosie (@Rosie) May 30, 2016Which is exactly what he did.
Let s not try to sugarcoat what a scam artist Donald Trump actually is.
He opened a make-believe university, took people s money, and laughed all the way to the bank.
He scammed people then like he is scamming people now when he says he ll make a good president.
When in reality he d be the worst president we ve ever seen.
Yes, even worse than George W. Bush.
Trump has absolutely no policy experience whatsoever, foreign or domestic, and he would be an embarrassment to the entire nation if he were to represent us in the world forum.It s getting to the point where you re waiting for the big reveal, as though someone is about to come out and say, Hey America, you re on Candid Camera, and we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief.
However, until then, kudos to Rosie O Donnell for keeping in real.Featured Photo by Andrew Toth/Getty Images for Fund for Women s Equality/ ERA Coalition
