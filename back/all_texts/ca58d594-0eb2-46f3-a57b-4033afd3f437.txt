So many acts of violence and vandalism have been committed against Americans who have voiced their support for Trump, that voters are staying silent about how they plan to vote.
That doesn t mean that massive numbers of voters won t be turning out for Trump when it comes to sending in their absentee ballots or showing up to the polls on November 8th.Don t let the media discourage you from getting out to vote for Trump and don t believe the polls!
Trump s rallies are a pretty good indication of how strong the momentum for his presidency really is.
Trump is doing 2-4 rallies every day across America, while Hillary is either fundraising or resting.
For the few rallies Hillary is actually doing, you d think she d be drawing massive crowds, but the truth of the matter is, she can barely fill a high school gym with people who are passionate about her becoming our next President.Listen to what former Governor Mike Huckabee has to say about the silent majority Trump voter:https://twitter.com/WesleyRickard/status/790329136115949570
