paris ( reuters ) - france is close to finalizing major military and transport contracts during a visit by emmanuel macron to qatar on thursday , a french presidential source said .
qatar has an option to buy 12 more dassault-made rafale fighter jets after buying 24 planes in 2015 for about 6 billion euros ( $ 7.11 billion ) and officials have said that the deal could be concluded this week .
the two sides are also in talks for sale of 300 vbci armored vehicles from french firm nexter and a contract worth some 3 billion euros to manage the doha metro for 20 years .
discussions are ongoing , a french presidential source told reporters on monday ahead of the visit .
you spoke about several dossiers for which the point of maturity is close , but i prefer to remain a little bit prudent and wait until thursday .
paris has close commercial and political ties with qatar and has pushed further business interests in the country as well as encourage investment into france , where the gas-rich gulf state already has assets of about $ 10 billion .
it has also sought to play a role as a go-between in a row , which began in early june when saudi arabia , bahrain , the united arab emirates and egypt cut political and trade ties with qatar .
since then qatar has sought to strengthen its military , including signing military equipment deals with the united states , russia and britain .
