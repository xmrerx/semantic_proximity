It wouldn t be the first time CNN anchor Anderson Cooper has smacked down Trump, and he just gets better every time.Just last month, Cooper called Trump out on his childish behavior when the business mogul launched an immature, misogyny-fueled attack against rival Ted Cruz s wife.
When Trump defended himself using a he started it argument, Cooper destroyed the Republican front runner by telling him, That s the argument of 5-year-old.
And at last night s town hall, Cooper didn t disappoint.Cooper began the interview by criticizing Trump for his ridiculous complaints about the delegate voting system in Colorado.
Ever since Cruz beat Trump in getting every last one of the 34 delegates support in the state, Trump has been whining and moaning about how unfair, rigged and crooked Colorado s system is.
Cooper completely shut Trump down when he asked the sore loser, The rules are the rules, didn t you just get outplayed on the ground?
Trump, continuing to insist that he was aware of the rules (even though he clearly wasn t), kept complaining that the voting system was some sort of anti-Trump conspiracy that was stacked against me.
Cooper wasn t having ANY of Trump s bullsh*t, and reminded him that Cruz had actually put time and effort into going out, reaching out to people who wanted to be delegates, to run the process in Colorado unlike Trump.Cooper told the business mogul, You could ve had a better organization on the ground, reminding him that he d had months to prepare.
Cooper then called Trump out on his egotistical overestimation of himself and said: For somebody who touts himself as somebody who s an organizational genius, as someone who s created this amazing business organization, that you couldn t create an organization on the ground that could beat Ted Cruz s organization.
