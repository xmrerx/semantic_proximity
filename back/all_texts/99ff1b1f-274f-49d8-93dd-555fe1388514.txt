Donald Trump s Education Secretary is off to a terribly embarrassing start.Just a day after being confirmed by the Senators she paid for after Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote, Betsy DeVos is already proving how ignorant she is about teaching and education.After her first full day in the position, DeVos posted a tweet about it and then joked about not knowing where the pencils are, which is pretty damn insulting to teachers since they usually have to buy their own pencils and other supplies.Day 1 on the job is done, but we re only getting started.
Now where do I find the pencils?

@BetsyDeVos not in the thousands of public schools that can barely afford supplies.
Looking forward to you cleaning that lil issue up.
Erin Weaver (@ByErinWeaver) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos Enjoy destroying our education system.
Good luck with your incompetence.
Alisha Grauso (@AlishaGrauso) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos you realize how NOT funny this is since most teachers buy their own supplies.
But I bet you re gonna pink slip them anyway.
MalyndaHale (@MalyndaHale) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos A true educator wouldn t have to ask we carry them with us at all times Laura Fischer (@Buckeyegal2008) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos You worked a whole day but didn t have anything to write with?
Maybe you could hold a bake sale to buy some pencils.
(((David Lytle))) (@davitydave) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos You gave the @GOP $200 million and not one of them will help you find supplies?
@marcorubio?
eBaum s World (@ebaumsworld) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos At the store.
Something you should know: we teachers buy pencils and supplies for our classes with our OWN money.
Robin McCauley Lynch (@RobinMcCauley) February 9, 2017@RobinMcCauley @WendyLiebman @BetsyDeVos I know teachers who use their own money for supplies and that s wrong.
Teachers deserve better.
Race Bannon (@BannonRace) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos I don t know, maybe go to a public school and get one?
USC (@AlumniUSC) February 9, 2017Funny enough, DeVos did, in fact, try to go to a public school on Friday morning and got blocked by protesters at the entrance.
So she ran away..@BetsyDeVos is this what you plan to do with your pencil while public school teachers work hard to educate and protect students?

@BetsyDeVos If YOU work in education, YOU buy the pencils, the paper, &, sometimes, a kid s shoes.
Spend a week in a school & GET A CLUE.
Crystal (@CMorganNC) February 9, 2017@BetsyDeVos Why don t you buy some pencils like you bought off your confirmation?
Easy D (@DaveStylee) February 9, 2017Betsy DeVos doesn t give a damn about education.
She only cares about indoctrinating our kids into her extremist religion and gutting the Education Department from the inside will help her do exactly that.
She should have never been confirmed but Republicans are easily bought.Teachers work hard to educate our kids.
They often have to spend their own money to make sure the classroom has enough supplies, including pencils.
Betsy DeVos deserves all the mockery she is receiving.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
