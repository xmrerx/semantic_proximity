At this point, pretty much everyone knows that failed vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin hates the media.
She hates being called out, and she hates being asked questions she just doesn t know the answer to which is pretty much every question.
She clearly gets embarrassed, and instead of owning up to the fact that she just simply doesn t know an answer, she blames the press for depicting her as a moron.
Little does she know, she does that to herself.However, people with narcissistic personality disorder seldom see the error in their own ways and will often shift blame.
You can see this with Donald Trump and in his new #1 fan, Sarah Palin.
They only see themselves as perfect and anyone who dares make them look otherwise is clearly just wrong.Case in point: Palin, upon leaving Iowa, met up with some lovely students at the Des Moines airport.
She could have just left it there and said something nice, but instead she had to throw a jab at the press calling them media jackals.
She also openly admitted that she prefers being interviewed by these children over credentialed professional journalists.Palin wrote on Facebook (as she does): Willow and I find it nice to be stuck in Des Moines airport with great kids like this Santa Monica class that traveled to the Iowa caucus on a field trip.
(Preferable to some media jackals weather-delayed in here, too.
I asked a few of them to take lessons from these 6th graders.)
Such polite students, asking the best questions about our political system!
Told them it was the best interview of the week!

Palin has consistently gone after the lamestream media for asking her gotcha questions all the time.
Gotcha questions of course being questions she has no clue how to answer and doesn t want to be perceived as an idiot, so she flips the script back on those posing the question.It makes perfect sense that Palin would want to be interviewed by a bunch of 6th graders.
Individuals that she may actually know more than or at least they won t know when she s lying and making things up.
Even better that they won t call her out.
So, if Palin is going to make a point of telling the world that she prefers 6th graders over the media jackals, well, she deserves to be called out on it.
She hates the media, because the media holds her accountable.Featured image: Flickr
