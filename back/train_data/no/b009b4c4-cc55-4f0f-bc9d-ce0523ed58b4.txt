president donald trump ripped the media today and it was great to see .
he said he didn t want to comment on the events over the weekend in charlottesville , va. , until he knew the all of the facts .
he said , you still don t know all of the facts well done mr. president ! trump spoke in trump tower today trying to discuss the infrastructure plan for america .
questions from reporters were instead about charlottesville and his reaction to the violence there .
the press kept asking why he didn t respond to the events faster potus : it takes a little while to get the facts .
you still don t know the facts , and it s a very , very important process to me .
the best part -he pulled out the statement from saturday : to clarify what he said on saturday , trump pulled out his remarks from that night and read them over for the press .
he said , before i make a statement , i need the facts .
so i don t want to rush into a statement , so making the statement when i made it was excellent .
trump takes a swipe at the media classic !
there was no way of making a correct statement that early .
i had to see the facts unlike a lot of reporters .
frankly , people still don t know all of the facts .
he hit back at the salivating press with such great force great job president trump !
