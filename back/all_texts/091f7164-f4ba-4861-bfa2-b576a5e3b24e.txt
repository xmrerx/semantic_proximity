It s hard to believe that Ben Carson is a brain surgeon after the words that have come out of his mouth during his run for the Republican nomination for the presidency.
Yet again, it s hard to believe the guy s running for the presidency at all.
In a continuous series of stupid comments, Ben Carson has once again outdone himself.
During an interview, Ben Carson claimed that President Obama was raised white and thus can t identify with the experience of black America.
But, Trevor Noah of The Daily Show isn t letting him off so easily.
During a segment of his show, Noah said: Like a glitched character on a video game, Ben Carson is just off facing the wrong direction.
Yeah, he is not attacking Trump or the other Republicans, but rather he s chosen to attack President Obama.
And it s not for his policies and it s not for his record.
It s for not being black enough.
So Ben Carson is saying that because Obama didn t grow up poor, he didn t grow up black.
That is such a bullshit argument.
Being poor isn t what makes you black.
Because if it is, then there are a lot of people living in trailers in the middle of America who will be very upset to hear the news.
I m what??
But they re not black.
And we know this.
Because if they were, their trailers would have nicer rims.
Although the segment is hilarious, Noah makes a brilliant point: Why not attack the president for his policies instead of some nonsensical measure of how black the president is or isn t?
Focusing on the issues will go a long way in lending some credibility to Ben Carson s campaign.
Thus, it s no wonder that his campaign is foundering.The type of cheap talk Carson has brought to the table is similar to that of the rest of the Republican clowns running for the nomination.
We shouldn t expect better.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture.
