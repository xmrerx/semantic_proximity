washington ( reuters ) - republican u.s .
senator rob portman on thursday said he opposes the trans-pacific partnership trade deal in its present form , dealing a significant blow to the pact a day after officials from 12 countries signed it .
portman , from ohio , said the pacific trade deal fails to meet the needs of his state ’ s workers because it lacks an enforceable provision to fight currency manipulation and because of new , less-stringent country-of-origin rules for auto parts .
“ i can not support the tpp in its current form because it doesn ’ t provide that level playing field , ” portman said in a statement .
while approval of the trade pact is a top priority of president barack obama this year , his final year in office , it faces stiff opposition from many of his fellow democrats in congress .
meanwhile , republicans have begun voicing concerns with specific provisions and are indicating that they are in no rush to bring the deal to a vote .
besides insisting that portions of the sweeping pact be renegotiated , some republicans worry that bringing tpp to a vote before the november elections could hurt the chances of some of their incumbents running in swing states or congressional districts .
portman is seeking a second term in an industrial state where many workers blame job losses on previous trade deals such as the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) .
he is expected to face a stiff challenge from former democratic governor ted strickland .
the 12-nation deal would liberalize trade from chile to japan , representing 40 percent of the world economy .
