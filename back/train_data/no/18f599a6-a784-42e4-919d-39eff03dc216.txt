dhaka ( reuters ) - indonesia s foreign minister will fly to bangladesh on tuesday for talks following her visit to myanmar where she urged national leader aung san suu kyi to end ongoing violence against the rohingya muslim minority there .
bangladesh s foreign secretary , shahidul haque , told reuters retno marsudi will meet bangladeshi officials in dhaka .
nearly 90,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh since aug. 25 , following an army crackdown triggered by attacks by rohingya insurgents in buddhist-majority myanmar s northwestern rakhine state .
the rakhine violence has killed at least 400 people , most of them rohingya insurgents , according to the myanmar government , leading to the exodus of rohingya to neighbouring bangladesh that is struggling to cope with the influx .
muslim-majority countries such as indonesia and turkey , who are trying to pressure nobel peace prize winner suu kyi to end the crisis , are also offering help to bangladesh deal with the massive inflow of people from across its 271 km ( 168 mile ) long border with myanmar .
