ankara ( reuters ) - a spokesman for turkish president tayyip erdogan accused german politicians on monday of indulging in populism after chancellor angela merkel said she would seek an end to ankara s european union membership talks .
merkel , seeking a fourth term in office in germany s sept. 24 election , said in a debate on sunday it was clear that turkey should not join the european union , and that she would talk to other eu leaders about ending its stalled accession process .
it is not a coincidence that our president erdogan was the main topic of the debate , erdogan s spokesman ibrahim kalin tweeted , criticizing what he described as mainstream german politicians indulgence in populism .
germany and europe s attacks on turkey/erdogan , by ignoring essential and urgent problems , are reflections of the narrowing of their horizons , he said .
we hope that the problematic atmosphere that made turkish-german relations the victim of this narrow political horizon will end .
turkey s ties with germany and several other eu states have deteriorated sharply this year .
points of dispute have included the barring of turkish politicians from holding campaign rallies in eu countries ahead of an april referendum , and concerns over the powers granted to erdogan in the closely fought plebiscite .
turkey has also restricted access for german parliamentarians seeking to visit german troops at the incirlik air base in southern turkey , leading berlin to announce it was moving those forces out of turkey .
it has also detained several german nationals , including journalist deniz yucel .
turkey says it has sent germany an extradition request for one of the main suspects it says was behind an attempted military coup in july 2016 .
more than 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 have been suspended or sacked in a security crackdown since the failed putsch .
