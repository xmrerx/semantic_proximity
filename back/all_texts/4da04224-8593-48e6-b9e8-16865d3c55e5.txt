Mike Pence tweeted about how he was looking forward to attending a Colts game with his wife Karen today.
His excitement was quickly extinguished, however, by the unpatriotic behavior of the Indianapolis Colts, who ve put their social justice causes before honoring our flag and our great nation.Looking forward to cheering for our @Colts & honoring the great career of #18 Peyton Manning at @LucasOilStadium today.
Go Colts!

Public opinion about the NFL and its players has taken a huge hit since President Trump tweeted about his disgust for the lack of respect the players have shown for our flag.
NFL ratings continue to be in the basement.Sporting News The alarming fall in NFL TV ratings this season is partly because of fan anger over on-field protests by Colin Kaepernick and other players of the American flag/national anthem, according to pollster Rasmussen Reports.Nearly one-third (32 percent) of adults say they re less likely to watch NFL game telecasts because of the Kaepernick-led player protests against racial injustice, according to Rasmussen s telephone/online survey of 1,000 American adults conducted Oct. 2-3.Only 13 percent said they were more likely to watch an NFL game because of continuing protests by Kaepernick and supporters such as Antonio Cromartie of the Colts (who was cut only two days after raising a fist during the playing of The Star-Spangled Banner in London on Sunday).
