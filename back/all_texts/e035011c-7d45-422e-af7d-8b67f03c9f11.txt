WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Representative Lee Zeldin said he would not support the tax reform legislation introduced by Republican congressional leaders on Thursday.
“I am a ‘no’ to this bill in its current form.
We need to fix this state and local tax deduction issue.
Adding back in the property tax deduction up to $10,000 is progress, but not enough progress,” Zeldin said in a statement.
A number of lawmakers from New York opposed eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes.
