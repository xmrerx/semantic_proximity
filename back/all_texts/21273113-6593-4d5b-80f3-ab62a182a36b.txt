Donald Trump is doing a horrendous job of raising his historically low approval rating in America, and it looks like he s not doing any better in trying to gain the approval and trust of the rest of the world.Thanks to a new survey by the Pew Research Center, we can now rest assured that the entire world hates Trump just as much as most Americans do.
The Pew Research Center surveyed 37 countries, discovering that 74% of respondents stated that when it comes to international affairs, they have ZERO confidence that Trump will respond appropriately or do the right thing.This will be damaging enough to Trump s ego, but it gets even worse for him!
Pew Research Center also reported that a similar survey was conducted on former President Barack Obama when he was POTUS, and it produced some VERY different results.
That survey revealed that 64% of respondents had complete faith in Obama on international affairs.While the fact that most of the world hates Trump is kind of hysterical, what it has done to America s reputation is quite depressing.
The study revealed that America s reputation has declined dramatically since the days of Obama.
When respondents were asked how they felt about the U.S., only 49% were favorable since Trump got into the White House, which was a 15% decline from Obama s time and it s only been a few months.
The authors of the survey said: In the eyes of most people surveyed around the world, the White House s new occupant is arrogant, intolerant and even dangerous.
Among the positive characteristics tested, his highest rating is for being a strong leader.
Fewer believe he is charismatic, well-qualified or cares about ordinary people.
Ironically, the only two countries who reported to have more confidence in Trump than Obama were Israel and, you guessed it Russia.
In fact, Russia increased 42% thanks to Trump s presidency, which should certainly raise some suspicion.You can check out the findings below:Featured image via Pool / Getty Images
