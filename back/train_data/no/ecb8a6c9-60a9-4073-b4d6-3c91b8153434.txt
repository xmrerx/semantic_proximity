it s hard to be famous for being a victim in an arab gulf state who settles their disputes in a sharia court of law .
someone should have told clock boy that being a victim in a country where victims are plentiful isn t really that special .
unlike america , being accused of bringing a fake bomb to school in qatar isn t likely a guarantee you ll land a visit with their king.within days of demanding a total of $ 15 million from the city of irving and the irving independent school district , clock boy ahmed mohamed announced in a long distance phone interview from qatar , he is homesick and wants to come home to texas now.it wasn t long before the clock boy and his father returned to texas and were filing a defamation lawsuit .
well today they got some bad news a year earlier , ahmed , then a 14-year-old freshman at an irving , texas , high school , was arrested , briefly detained by police , and suspended for three days after bringing to school a cool clock that looked like a briefcase bomb .
ahmed claimed to have invented the easily assembled clock , and that he had brought it to school to show it to his shop teacher.the incident led many to question the mohamed family s motives .
newly appointed district court judge maricela moore dismissed the lawsuit following a nearly three-hour hearing on monday , according to the american freedom law center : mohamed had sued hanson and csp for statements hanson had made on beck s program about the connection between the clock boy hoax bomb affair , the attendant media frenzy created in large part by his father mohamed , civilization jihad , and the counsel on american-islamic relations ( cair ) , the muslim brotherhood-hamas front group in the united states that promotes civilization jihad.here s a clip from hanson s interview with glenn beck : during the hearing , aflc co-founder and senior counsel david yerushalmi explained to judge moore that the purpose of the lawfare-driven lawsuit was to intimidate into silence those who might comment publicly on the connection between jihad , terrorism , sharia , and islam .
as such , yerushalmi argued , this case is a classic strategic lawsuit against public participation or slapp case and should be dismissed .
during the lengthy hearing , judge moore pressed mohamed s lawyer , fort worth attorney susan hutchison , to provide any facts that would suggest that hanson and the other defendants had said anything false or defamatory about mohamed or his son during the television broadcasts .
after spending a painfully embarrassing 15 minutes flipping through reams of paper , mohamed s lawyer was unable to provide any such evidence.upon leaving the courtroom , yerushalmi made the following statement : this lawsuit filed by clock boy s father is yet another example of islamist law fare , which is a component of the muslim brotherhood s civilization jihad .
