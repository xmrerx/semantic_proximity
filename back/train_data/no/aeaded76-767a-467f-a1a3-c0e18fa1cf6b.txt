cleveland ( reuters ) - republican presidential nominee donald trump , who gained popularity partly by bashing wealthy donors and vowing to fund his own campaign , raised nearly as much money in june as the campaign of democratic rival hillary clinton , according to federal reports filed on wednesday .
in the first month in which the trump campaign ’ s fundraising machine officially cranked up , trump raised nearly $ 20 million from individual donors other than himself , as well as $ 2 million from donors to his joint fundraising committee with the republican party .
the reports also showed that trump converted the nearly $ 50 million in loans he made to his campaign into donations .
he has $ 20 million in cash in the bank .
clinton ’ s campaign brought in $ 24 million from individual donors during the same period , and a further $ 11.5 million from donors to her joint fundraising committee .
trump ’ s new money dash was also evident at the republican national convention in cleveland this week , where two trump super pacs - each dueling for supremacy and boasting a roster of marquee donors - held private events .
those in the donor class backing trump include investor foster friess and casino magnate sheldon adelson , who associates say is considering pouring as much as $ 100 million into helping trump get elected .
