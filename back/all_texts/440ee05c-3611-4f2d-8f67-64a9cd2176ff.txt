You know, for being a member of the master race, President Steve Bannon sure fails to look the part.
On Wednesday, Argentinian-American comedienne Tamara Yajia posted a photo of Steve Bannon that highlighted a rather glorious pustule on his face.
Yummy, she wrote to accompany the horrifying image.Yummy pic.twitter.com/8r0aKIfhJW Tamara Yajia (@DancesWithTamis) February 24, 2017Naturally, the internet gods accepted this offering gleefully and their servants amassed to join together in mockery of the white supremacist who is for some reason allowed to act as President while The Donald plays with his toys and tweets like a middle schooler.

He's very sensitive.

I bet he stinks.
Denise (@DDavis2) February 24, 2017@DancesWithTamis I would rather eat your thyroid than look at close-ups of Bannon's rosacea-infused facial hair.

Arak (@rickydilly1949) February 24, 2017Apparently, not everyone was happy with the tweet but Yajia was perfectly happy to tell them exactly where they can fuck which is off.

More revently, he admitted that all of Trump s his cabinet picks were intended to destroy the institutions they were chosen to lead.In short, fuck him and the monster living on his face.Featured image via screengrab
