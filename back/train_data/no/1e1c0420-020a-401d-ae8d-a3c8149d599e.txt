washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. senate judiciary committee on thursday unanimously approved the nomination of christopher wray to be fbi director following the dismissal of the agency â€™ s former chief , james comey , by president donald trump .
all 20 members of the committee voted to approve wray , a white-collar crime lawyer and former assistant attorney general under president george w. bush , sending his nomination to the full senate for a vote .
trump nominated wray last month after firing comey during an fbi investigation into whether trump campaign associates colluded with the russians to help him with the 2016 presidential election .
