Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters are going to lose their shit when they hear about this.Since 1960, Mama Ayesha s restaurant has served Middle Eastern cuisine in Washington D.C. in the same spot.
Since 2009, it has been the home of a special presidential mural featuring Ayesha standing in unison with the last ten presidents, including President Obama.
This is Mama welcoming the presidents to DC, her great-nephew Abu-El-Hawa told the Washingtonian about the painting.
She was the American dream.
For a Muslim and Arab woman immigrant from Palestine to come here on her own and build this business, is a remarkable legacy.
The painting was commissioned in 2007 and supported by the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities and was completed by artist Karla Karlisima Rodas, an immigrant from El Salvador.But Donald Trump will not be joining the ten presidents on the mural.
And that s a good thing.When Ayesha passed away in 1993, she left the famous restaurant to her nephew, who is citing budgetary reasons for declining to add Trump to the mural.
Our official position is that it is not in the budget, Abu-El-Hawa stated.In other words, Trump can go f*ck himself.Donald Trump does not deserve to be recognized in a mural that celebrates diversity.
Mama Ayesha is a Palestinian woman linking arms with ten presidents, one of whom is the first African-American president.
It would also be insulting to President Obama since Trump would be shown linking arms with him.And that just does not jive well considering Trump is a racist divider who panders to white supremacists and wants to ban Muslims from the country, which would be an insult to Ayesha.Here s a look at the mural via YouTube.The mural serves as Washington DC s largest postcard and it s safe to say that Trump is not someone who will make people want to visit our nation s capital.Cue the temper tantrum from Trump and his supporters in 3 2 1 Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
