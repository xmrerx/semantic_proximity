Bernie Sanders appeared on Jimmy Kimmel to a wildly cheering crowd and he offered a voice of reason on a host of issues including the latest terror attacks in Belgium.
In response to Trump s and Cruz s draconian calls to suppress Muslims, Bernie said: I think people get afraid, and for good reasons.
ISIS is a disgusting, barbaric organization.
We ve seen what they ve done in Paris, what they ve done in Brussels.
People are afraid of an attack in the United States.
But I think what we have to understand is we re not going to undermine the Constitution of the United States of America in order to effectively destroy ISIS.
At the end of the day, we cannot allow the Trumps of the world to use these incidents to attack all of the Muslim people in the world.
That is unfair.
To imply that if somebody is a Muslim they re a terrorist, that is an outrageous statement.Watch Video Here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNJs_rqboBQ]On a lighter note, when Sanders appeared on Kimmel back in October, Kimmel said that he thought to himself: This is a very smart guy, he has some very interesting ideas, he obviously loves his country, but there s no way we ll still be seeing him in March.
And yet here you are.
Are you surprised by this?
