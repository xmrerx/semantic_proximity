brussels ( reuters ) - israel must halt new building plans for settler homes in the west bank , the european union s foreign service said in a statement on wednesday , warning that such settlements threatened any future peace deal with the palestinians .
the european union has requested clarifications from israeli authorities and conveyed the expectation that they reconsider these decisions , which are detrimental to on-going efforts towards meaningful peace talks , the statement said .
all settlement activity is illegal under international law , and it undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospect for a lasting peace .
the eu maintains that the lands israel has occupied since the 1967 middle east war - including the west bank , east jerusalem and the golan heights - are not part of the internationally recognized borders of israel .
