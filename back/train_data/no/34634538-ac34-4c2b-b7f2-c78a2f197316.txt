friends of bill long-secret emails just caught team hillary in another blatant lie namely , the claim that clinton foundation donors got no special treatment from clinton s state department .
in fact , abc s case study of the 2010 haiti-relief feeding frenzy may be the most damning foundation scoop yet.and the foundation isn t even denying it.abc news got the emails via a freedom of information lawsuit .
they show that , after the devastating 2010 haiti earthquake , a top hillary aide repeatedly gave special attention to friends of bill looking to cash in.indeed , the aide , caitlin klevorick , kept asking foundation official amitabh desai to flag when people are friends of wjc william jefferson clinton .
anyone without a special tag ( fob , wjc-vip ) got rebuffed by state and referred to a federal website.state was besieged with requests to get in on $ 10 billion in aid contracts , described in one government cable as a gold rush .
one fob , a major foundation donor who d served as bill s texas chair , used his pull on behalf of a firm he admitted wanted to get some of the business and had him use the clinton foundation as a facilitator .
klevorick told abc the special attention was about learning who had a history in haiti so as to get the necessary resources to the right places as soon as possible to save lives .
one problem : she never asked if anyone had experience in haiti or even with aid relief .
her only question : is this a fob ?
and her only instruction to the foundation was that all fobs be flagged .
which is why the haiti analyst for the nonpartisan center for economic and policy says , the line was pretty faint between the foundation and the state department.even if the clintons follow through on their vow to put disinterested third parties in charge at the foundation , this is a warning of how a clinton white house would work because political favoritism and corruption are just how bill and hillary roll.via : nyp
