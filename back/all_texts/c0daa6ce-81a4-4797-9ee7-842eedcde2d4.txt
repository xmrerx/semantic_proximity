Donald Trump held a press conference today to clarify every since bit of accusations made that he pocketed over six million dollars meant for veterans.
Basically, Trump shut the liberal media down.
It was awesome!
What was even better was watching a New Hampshire lawmaker rip into the liberal press like I ve never seen!
