Donald Trump is a jerk.
There s no sugar-coating it.
He s a bully, and he s proven that fact over and over and over again.
His activities early Friday morning were no different.Trump took to Twitter in yet another Twitter tantrum going after both Hillary Clinton and former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.
Machado, of course, being the woman he s continually fat-shamed even to this day.Trump tweeted out:Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT!
Hillary was set up by a con.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media.
If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Actually, it would seem Trump s sources don t exist according to a Snopes article debunking his claim of a sex tape.
And as far as going after any woman for risque photos, he s really not the guy to do that seeing as who is he currently married to.
Just saying.Hillary, not about to take this hissy fit lightly, decided to be the grown up in this election.
You know, the one not asking people to look at sex tapes, and tweeted out her own series of statements regarding this very topic and beyond.This is unhinged, even for Trump.
A few notes.
https://t.co/WURWs6aJ5f Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016Alicia deserves praise for courageously standing up to Trump's attacks.
And he has the gall to blame her and say he "helped"?
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go.
This is dangerous for a president.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016To Donald, women like Alicia are only as valuable as his personal opinion about their looks.

He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight when she was pregnant.
Pathetic.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016We've heard Donald's insults for years, and his policies reflect this disregard even contempt for women.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016Trump on equal pay: "Do as good a job" as men.Abortion?
Should be "punished."Pregnancy?
An "inconvenience.
"Wives working?
"Dangerous."
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016Hillary is absolutely correct.
Donald Trump despises the thought of women being not only more powerful than him but just in general if they do not fit his standard of existence.If you want my take on the whole thing, this about sums it up:This pretty much sums it up VOTE BLUE pic.twitter.com/diYSJixHIf Sarah Wood (@SarahWoodwriter) May 5, 2016Featured Photos by Spencer Platt, Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
