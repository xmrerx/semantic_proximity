a producer at the women in the world event had an awkward moment on thursday night when he was caught in the spotlight while leading hillary clinton onto the stage.the backstage producer could be seen with his hand on clinton s back leading her onto the stage and pointing her in which direction to walk to get to her position.hillary gingerly walking across the stage to greet samantha bee , who introduced her , letting out a hearty cackle while successfully negotiating the riser.moments later , clinton conquered a single step like a pro before taking a seat.ummm sorry samantha bee , but we re not seeing the beyonc connection .
