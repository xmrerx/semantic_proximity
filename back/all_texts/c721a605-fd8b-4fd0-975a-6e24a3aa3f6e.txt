The Clampetts are at it again!
As usual, the responsible gun owning population can t make it a single day without shooting or threatening to shoot someone over something nonsensical.
On Saturday, one brave patriot decided that two men waiting to harvest the meat from an animal someone hit along a Montana highway were getting just a bit too greedy so he proposed a Second Amendment Solution to the problem.An elk had been hit by a car earlier in the day, and two men stopped to wait for it to die so they could grab it, take it home, and salvage the meat from its corpse.
Sure, eating roadkill is something one would not expect to create an issue in 2016 but a third man apparently got a bit jealous over the bounty of road splatter.As the men waited, somehow unwilling to put the elk out of its misery, 52-year-old Kenrick Workman drove to the scene where the two men were eagerly awaiting an opportunity to have themselves some roadkill.
After arguing with the gentlemen who were patiently awaiting dinner, Workman pushed one of the men and retrieved a handgun from his car.
He then threatened to shoot them.The men called police, who arrested Workman on existing warrants for a DUI, resisting arrest, and assault with a firearm.The NRA regularly assures us that gun owners are exactly the people who will save us from oblivion.
While they draw a distinction between good guys and bad guys with guns, the problem is that in the eyes of the NRA everyone is a good guy with a gun until they commit a crime.
In other words, everyone should be trusted with a weapon until it is too late even someone who would rush out of his home to threaten people in a bizarre argument over who gets to eat the animal someone left on the side of the road.It is unclear if anyone got to eat the elk.Featured image via
