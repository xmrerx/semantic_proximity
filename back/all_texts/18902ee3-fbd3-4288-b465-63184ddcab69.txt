This has just got to end!
We have kids pouring across our border and they are not going home.
It s a literal invasion with the Obama administration s approval.Pinal County, AZ Sheriff and Congressional candidate Paul Babeu (R) stated, just the last two months alone, we ve had 10,000 unaccompanied juveniles who are staying here and that the Obama administration says the border is wide open, that there is no law it comes to immigration on Monday s Cavuto: Coast to Coast on the Fox Business Network.
He added, We re a compassionate nation.
We always have been.
And this is where I m tired of being shouted down by President Obama, like somehow we re not good Americans if we don t do everything that he says we should to do.
And we ve had a million legal immigrants last year, and we do this every year.
Babeu continued, I think it s the most compassionate thing we can do, is reunite them with their families in Central America.
What America should be doing is finding ways to solve the problems of violence in Central America, support their governments, because if we don t solve that core problem, this isn t going to end.
We re going to have this problem next month, next year, and then we own these people, and all the social network to support them for their entire lives.
Because if you think that these kids are going anywhere, think again.
They re staying here.
Babeu further argued, our compassion, there has to be a limit to this.
And we don t see people in Europe, in the countries there, taking kids refugees from central america, yet everybody wants us to take Syrian refugees from halfway across the world.
So, where s the fairness here?
