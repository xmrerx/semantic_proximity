zurich ( reuters ) - austria s likely next chancellor , sebastian kurz , wants talks over a new government to last no more than two months , he said in a newspaper interview published in sunday .
austria s president on friday gave the green light to conservative leader kurz , whose people s party ( ovp ) secured 31.5 percent of the vote in last week s parliamentary election , to form a government .
the austrians expect that there is quickly a strong and stable government which takes up work , kurz was quoted as saying by austria s kronen zeitung .
that means that negotiations should be concluded in less than 60 days .
kurz campaigned on a platform that combined a hard line on immigration similar to that of the far-right freedom party ( fpo ) with traditional conservative principles like slimming down the state and cutting taxes .
to form his coalition , only two of austria s parliamentary parties , the social democrats ( spo ) and fpo , have enough seats to give kurz a majority if they go into coalition with the ovp .
kurz is currently holding an initial round of discussions with the leaders of all parties in parliament , the last of which is his meeting with outgoing chancellor christian kern , the head of the social democrats , later on sunday .
in a separate interview with tabloid oesterreich , kurz said his party has common ground with the fpo and that he had already held constructive talks with fpo leader heinz-christian strache .
in the conversation with heinz-christian strache , i also had the impression that he has a strong willingness to effect change and creative drive , kurz was quoted as saying by oe24 .
but now i will conclude these talks on sunday , and then take up coalition negotiations with a partner .
