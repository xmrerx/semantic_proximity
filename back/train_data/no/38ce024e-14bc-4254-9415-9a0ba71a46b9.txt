phnom penh ( reuters ) - cambodian prime minister hun sen on sunday called for the closure of one of the country s main human rights groups because it was founded by detained opposition leader kem sokha .
a crackdown on critics of hun sen , the world s longest serving prime minister , has already led to the dissolution of the main opposition party and curbs on some independent media , prompting criticism from western donors .
the cambodian center for human rights ( cchr ) must be shut down because it was created by foreigners not cambodians .
the ministry of the interior should look into this , hun sen told a group of garment workers .
hun sen described the opposition as children of the united states and said he told this to u.s. president donald trump when they met in the philippines earlier this month .
the cchr was founded by kem sokha in 2002 before he returned to a political career in 2007 .
kem sokha was arrested in september and charged with treason for an alleged plot to take power with american help .
his cambodia national rescue party was dissolved on nov. 16 by the supreme court , acting at the government s request .
kem sokha has rejected the charges against him , which the opposition calls a ploy to ensure hun sen extended over three decades in power in next year s election .
western countries have condemned the crackdown .
the united states has stopped funding for the election and the european union has raised a potential threat to cambodia s duty free access if it does not respect human rights .
hun sen has brushed off the criticism .
cambodia s biggest donor is now china , which has voiced support for measures to ensure stability .
