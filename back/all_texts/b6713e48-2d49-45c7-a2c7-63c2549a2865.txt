In case you haven t noticed, because maybe you ve been living away at sea with no contact to the rest of humanity, Donald Trump likes to tweet a lot, especially about what he loves the most the media.Oh, he ll say he hates the media, but he s been given hundreds and hundreds of free press coverage hours and air time to spew his hatred and lies, you d think, maybe sometimes, that the media was pulling for Trump to win.However, Trump doesn t see it that way.
He doesn t like it when people don t say nice things about him at all times.
Of course, he can pay people to do that on his campaign team.
Thus the revolving door of campaign managers.
Yet, when it comes to the press, they re pretty much just going to report the words coming out of his mouth, and he really doesn t like that, because, well, he s an ass, and honest reporting highlights that fact.In yet another whiny tweet, Trump unloads on the media, but this time around his source for the media being unfair to him is, well, the media.He tweeted: It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2016So, let me get this perfectly clear: Trump is whining that the media is piling on against him, and his proof of that is the media.Okay there, buddy.
Way to fully contradict yourself.
Sad!How in the hell does he think he can be president if he can t handle criticism?If only there were a tiny violin to play him a sad, sad song.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images; Twitter
