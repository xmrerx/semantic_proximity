president obama blasted republican presidential front-runner donald trump in april , 2016 for his plan to bar immigrants in the u.s. from sending money back home to force mexico to pay for a new border wall .
oh , no .
it s trump , a smiling obama said when he was asked about the 2016 candidate s latest comments.obama called plan another shortsighted idea from trump that could spark concern among world leaders .
i am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made , obama told reporters at the white house.obama said trump s border wall proposal could have enormous economic consequences for mexico , which receives billions of dollars in payments that immigrants in the u.s. send home , and possibly touch off a major spat with an ally .
the notion that we are going to track every western union bit of money that s being sent to mexico good luck with that , obama said.obama s remarks came after the washington post published a two-page memo from trump outlining how he would get mexico to pay for his wall .
trump s memo outlines how he would cut off certain remittances cash transfers from people in the united states to mexico unless mexico s government offered $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion to pay for the wall.mexican president enrique pe a nieto has said he won t pay for trump s wall and claimed the candidate has damaged u.s.-mexico relations.the country s former president , vicente fox , slammed the proposal , saying , i m not going to pay for that f ing wall .
meanwhile , tmz reported that workers are busy building a large wall around obama s new dc residence where he will be moving from the white house , that was coincidentally , also surrounded by a massive wall.why is it that politicians like obama and even republican speaker of the house paul ryan , who has a two-decade-long history of promoting open borders immigration policies , have no problem building a border fence for themselves and their family , even as they denies the american people those same protections.they re quick to criticize trump and his supporters for wanting to build a wall on our southern border to keep foreign intruders and criminals out for the sake of our national security , yet have no problem erecting large walls around their personal residences to keep their own families safe
