WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Monday that a probe on whether to launch an investigation into China’s intellectual property practices will be one of his office’s “highest priorities.” Lighthizer said in a statement that China’s industrial policies and other practices “reportedly” have forced the transfer of vital U.S. technology to Chinese companies.
“We will engage in a thorough investigation and, if needed, take action to preserve the future of U.S. industry,” Lighthizer said.
“Thousands of jobs are at stake for our workers and for future generations.”
