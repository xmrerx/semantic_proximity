berlin ( reuters ) - french prime minister edouard philippe said during a visit to berlin on friday that britain had still not clearly defined its positions on brexit and that this was making negotiations with the eu-27 more difficult .
answering questions from an audience in berlin after a speech on the french government s reform drive , philippe rejected a suggestion that other european countries were being tough on britain and said it bore blame for difficulties in the talks .
our aim is not to be tough with the british .
what is true is that these are difficult negotiations , philippe said .
and they are difficult , they have been made difficult , because the initial positions of british diplomats still need to be clearly defined to a certain extent , he added , before heading to the chancellery for a meeting with germany s angela merkel .
nearly three months into talks on the terms of britain s departure from the european union , the two sides have made little progress on the issues that brussels wants resolved before talks on a future trading relationship begin .
these include expatriate citizens rights , the irish border and the bill that london should pay its eu partners to settle existing financial commitments .
philippe said he regretted britain s decision to leave the eu and , coming from normandy , felt like he was among cousins when he traveled to the united kingdom .
but he said it was important for the eu-27 and its lead negotiator , frenchman michel barnier , to ensure that the interests of citizens on the continent were protected .
for that , the bloc had to stick to its sequencing plan .
it is our responsibility to ensure that the exit is done in an orderly manner , philippe said .
