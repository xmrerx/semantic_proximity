islamabad ( reuters ) - a pakistani anti-corruption court on tuesday issued an arrest warrant for finance minister ishaq dar after the veteran politician failed to turn up for several court hearings .
the warrant comes at an awkward time for pakistan , which wants to raise in excess of $ 1 billion on international debt markets through a sukuk and a eurobond in coming months and has been trying to woo international investors .
dar , who has been charged with amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income , has missed three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency the national accountability bureau ( nab ) .
judge mohammad bashir issued the warrant on the grounds of continued absence from the court , according to a court statement .
dar , who has pleaded not guilty , is receiving medical treatment in london and now faces arrest upon his return to pakistan .
the case has been adjourned until nov. 21 .
the charges against dar followed an investigation into the finances of former prime minister nawaz sharif , who was ousted in july after the supreme court disqualified him for not declaring a small salary from his son s off-shore company .
the finance minister is one of sharif s closest political allies and dar s son has married sharif s daughter .
both men deny any wrongdoing .
dar has rejected growing calls to resign amid his legal woes and a worsening economic outlook for pakistan , which is battling to stave off a balance of payments crisis due to dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit .
dar was initially lauded for steering pakistan out of a balance of payments crisis in 2013 and returning the nuclear-armed country toward a higher growth trajectory .
but over the past year he has faced criticism for his refusal to allow the rupee to weaken to ease macroeconomic pressures .
he has also been accused of eroding the central bank s independence .
