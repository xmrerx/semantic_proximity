On the same day as Hillary Clinton denounced Donald Trump for his racist alt-right connections in a blistering speech, she released a devastating new ad that put his white supremacist ties on full display for the world to see.The ad opened with a clip of a Grand Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan declaring that he and other white supremacists support Trump because a lot of what he believes in, we believe in.
It also featured robocalls that had been made by white supremacists on behalf of the Republican nominee during the primaries.
Another clip in the ad has former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke announcing that voting against Trump is treason to your heritage.
The ad also shows when Trump failed to disavow Duke and white supremacy in general.Clinton s campaign ad also calls out Trump s most recent campaign manager, Stephen Bannon, who is the CEO of alt-right Breitbart news.
The alt-right is described in the ad as the dressed-up-in-suits version of the neo-nazi and white supremacist movements.
The racist white supremacist support Trump s campaign receives cannot be ignored, and Hillary Clinton is making sure that his bigotry doesn t slip through the cracks now that he has launched minority outreach efforts in the hopes of luring voters of color to the GOP.
Trump has dog-whistled to white supremacists from the very beginning and has only gotten bolder as time has gone on.
As a result, the racist extremists of the alt-right have flocked to his cause.
As Clinton points out in this ad, if Trump wins in November, they could be running the country.
