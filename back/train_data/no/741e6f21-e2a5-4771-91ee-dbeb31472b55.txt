liberal compassion : this story is a perfect example of how the left is leaving citizens behind in favor of invaders from other countries .
why are we allowing politicians to have this kind of power ?
where are the voices of the citizens who are watching their heritage and centuries of a rich history in their countries being stolen overnight by strangers , many of whom are looking for a better economic situation ? a homeless man has been found dead in the centre of bolzano .
the corpse was found by some passers-by in a makeshift bed made from cardboard boxes , alongside the wall of the hotel alpi , which is currently being used to house refugees .
according to the investigators initial information , there were no traces of violence on the man s body.here is a photo of the lobby in the 4-star hotel bolzano : here is an image of the refugees who live there .
this was taken in july last year , as they were staging a protest about not being given enough milk .
please note the refugee with the smart phone and earbuds .
the suffering of these refugees can be summed up in this one picture : via : ansa.it trentino aa/s
