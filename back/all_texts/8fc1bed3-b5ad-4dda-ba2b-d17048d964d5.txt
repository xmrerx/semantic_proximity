A movement has apparently been afoot in many Starbucks stores around the country Trump fans have been putting Trump on their cups so that the baristas have to shout the Cheeto King s name.
They were angry with the company after CEO Howard Schultz endorsed Hillary for president, which gave birth to a hashtag called #TrumpCup.#TrumpCup blew up when a racist bigot in a Miami store with a long line claimed the staff refused to give him his coffee because he supported Trump.
In truth, the line at the store was long, they were backed up, and this delicate, privileged white guy thought he was more important than everyone else especially the black baristas he no doubt saw as his servants.
He claimed he was having a bad day, and then did an about-face and claimed racial discrimination because he s white.
Poor boopsie.Because of that, Trumpkins began widespread protests against the anti-white discrimination at Starbucks by buying more Starbucks.There s a very special irony here.
They re punishing Starbucks by giving the company their money.
Well, they actually probably think they re punishing individual baristas and store managers especially those who are minorities because they have the audacity to be minorities working for a company that endorsed Hillary Clinton, and so is obviously prejudiced against whites.Either way, they re more or less saying that Starbucks must die, because reasons, and making them richer instead.
They just don t seem to get that protesting a business means you don t spend your money there.
The goal is to put such a dent in their sales that they have no choice but to change something.
This absurd mistake has been pointed out multiple times on Twitter:I don t think Trumpkins have thought this whole #TrumpCup throughIf you have to buy a product from the place you re boycotting #FAIL CaptainsLog2016 (@CaptainsLog2016) November 18, 2016 Our #TrumpCup boycott was a success.
Now what?

#TrumpCup Matthew Chapman (@fawfulfan) November 18, 2016Perhaps this can be filed under, Trump fans are too dumb to know they re dumb.
It really takes a special kind of dumb, though, to not know that trying to protest a company buy buying their product is jut about the most oblivious thing out there.Good luck with your protest, guys.
Starbucks is probably guffawing over how effective it isn t.Featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet
