frankfurt ( reuters ) - one of sweden s most notorious criminals appeared in a court in germany on wednesday , charged with a murder he is accused of having committed in frankfurt more than 25 years ago .
the man , john ausonius , went on a racially motivated spree in sweden in 1991 and 1992 in which he killed one person and injured 10 others in attacks in the stockholm area , for which he is currently serving a life sentence in sweden .
dubbed the laser man by swedish media for his use of a laser sight and rifle for some of the shootings , he is thought to have inspired anti-immigrant attacks such as the 2011 massacre by norwegian anders breivik and shootings by peter mangs in sweden .
ausonius , now 64 , is suspected of having shot dead a woman in broad daylight in frankfurt in 1992 while on the run from the authorities after the shootings in sweden .
he had accused the 68-year-old woman of stealing an electronic notebook from his coat pocket in the cloakroom of the frankfurt hotel in which she worked , a spokeswoman for the frankfurt prosecutor s office said on wednesday .
the prosecution believes that the defendant thought the woman had his electronic notebook in her handbag , she told reuters tv outside the courthouse .
ausonius has denied killing the woman but has not objected to being transferred to germany for the trial on condition he serves any possible jail sentence in sweden .
after the murder trial ends , he is to be returned to sweden where a court sentenced him to life in 1995 for the stockholm shootings as well as a string of bank robberies .
