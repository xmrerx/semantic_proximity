BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah said on Friday a U.S. cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase was an “idiotic step” which would lead to “great and dangerous tensions” in the Middle East.
Hezbollah, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the six-year-old conflict, said in a statement the strike would not demoralize the Syrian army or negatively affect its allies.
The U.S. military action was a “service” to Israel and its “ambitions in the region,” Hezbollah added, without elaborating.
