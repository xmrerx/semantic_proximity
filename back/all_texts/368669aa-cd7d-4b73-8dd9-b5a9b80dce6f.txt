EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that if Britain is leaving the European Union then single market and customs union membership were the only sensible option , adding that now the negotiations would move on to a new tougher level.
Move to phase 2 of talks good - but devil is in the detail and things now get really tough.
If Brexit is happening (wish it wasn t) staying in single market & customs union is only sensible option.
And any special arrangements for NI must be available to other UK nations, she said on Twitter.
