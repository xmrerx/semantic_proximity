WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump believes Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore should step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, the White House said on Thursday.
“The president believes that these allegations are very troubling and should be taken seriously, and he thinks that the people of Alabama should make the decision on who their next senator should be,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said at a news briefing.
“The president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true then Roy Moore should step aside.
He still firmly believes that,” she said.
