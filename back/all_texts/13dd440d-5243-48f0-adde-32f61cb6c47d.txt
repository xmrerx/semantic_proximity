President Barack Obama singlehandedly caused a collective right-wing freak out on Monday when he took a picture in front of a Cuban ministry building that just happened to have a Che Guevara mural.Obama has been in Cuba since Sunday, making the trip a truly historic three day visit because a sitting U.S. president hasn t visited the country in 88 years.
During the trip, Obama is accompanied by his family and dozens of American politicians and business leaders who are aiding the President in a crucial initiative to build a bridge between the U.S. and Cuba two countries that have had political differences for decades.
This photograph (along with many others) was taken as Obama was taking part in a wreath laying ceremony with several other officials in Havana s Revolution Plaza.Obamas s cause was noble, but as soon as word got out about the photograph, conservative websites didn t hesitate to start bashing the President for posing in front of the image of the Cuban Marxist revolutionary leader.
The Drudge Report was one of the first, throwing up the photo on their site and captioning it with Mission Accomplished.
Drudge ReportTownhall.com called the photo a gem of a picture, and The Washington Examiner said the image had created a fresh wave of fury.
The outrage continued on social media, as conservatives on Twitter unleashed an avalanche of accusations and insults.
One user called Obama a disgrace while another criticized the President for posing with Che Guevara s image but not going to Navy SEAL Chris Kyle s memorial service in 2013.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterConservatives have been slamming Obama ever since he stepped foot in Cuba yesterday, obviously because they are more in favor of hostile, divisive relations than the mutual understanding and respect that the President is trying to create.
Both Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz and former (failed) GOP candidate Marco Rubio have openly condemned Obama s visit.
The Right s reaction to Obama s photograph and overall visit to Cuba is just more proof that they will oppose, and try to tear down Obama any chance they get no matter how far-reaching their reactions are.
