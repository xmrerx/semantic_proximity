If you haven t heard, Donald Trump has joined Adolf Hitler as the latest Deplorable to become Time s Person of the Year.
Beating out Hillary Clinton, the Flint, Michigan whistleblowers, Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, Mark Zuckerberg, and others who have actually accomplished something that didn t involve fraud, racism.
Aside from her numerous other documented accomplishments, Hillary Clinton snagged the second-highest popular vote numbers in history and became the first to ever do that without also winning the election.When Time posted the announcement Wednesday, the internet just couldn t handle granting this honor to someone like Trump:@TIME pic.twitter.com/9nKga5Ke6o Bill Jansen (@TheBillJansen) December 8, 2016@TIME you are biased and what you have done is pathetic.
You just lost credibility with me not good.

John Mac Intyre (@JayMac8500) December 8, 2016Time explains that for better or worse, Trump was named Person of the Year because he had the greatest influence over the news this year:The revolution he stirred feels fully American, with its echoes of populists past, of Andrew Jackson and Huey Long and, at its most sinister, Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin.
Trump s assault on truth and logic, far from hurting him, made him stronger.
His appeal part hope, part snarl dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics.
Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world, from Britain to the Philippines, and taps forces far more powerful than one man s message.We can scarcely grasp what our generation has wrought by putting a supercomputer into all of our hands, all of the time.
If you are reading this, whether on a page or a screen, there is a very good chance that you are caught up in a revolution that may have started with enticing gadgets but has now reshaped everything about how we live, love, work, play, shop, share how our very hearts and minds encounter the world around us.
Why would we have imagined that our national conversation would simply go on as before, same people, same promises, same patterns?
Perhaps the President-elect will stop tweeting but only because he will have found some other means to tell the story he wants to tell directly to the audience that wants to hear it.Time is correct that Trump has perhaps had the greatest impact on the news, but one must wonder why they would choose to reward the bigotry and hate he encouraged and continues to encourage in their annual marketing gimmick.
Normally, this would be a run-of-the-mill honor, even for a dictator (Time called Hitler the greatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today in their 1938 article), but Trump thrives off of the attention and Time should have made the decision not to enable him.Featured image via Time
