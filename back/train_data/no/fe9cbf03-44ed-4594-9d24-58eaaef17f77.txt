dressing up as an arab sheik for halloween was not what i had planned but now i really think i ll buy this costume and wear it on halloween .
could someone tell the muslims to knock it off with being offended all the time about everything !
just like i tell my children , the ability to laugh at yourself is huge !
take it all in good fun why don t ya ?
just think how donald trump will feel this halloween with all the horrific costumes making fun of him .
how about all those costumes making fun of so called hillbillies or rednecks do you think anyone gives a damn ?
get over yourselves !
we previously reported on all the universities across america who re dictating what you can and can not wear on halloween .
customers shopping online for various items of interest , or just simply looking for something to be offended by , found the latter in the halloween section of the retailer s website .
nestled among the typical witch and superhero costumes for kids was a costume of a different kind that arabs found to be in extremely poor taste .
it s beyond me who would want to dress up as an arab sheik or achmed the mad bomber , but it freakin halloween .
it s a big holiday for kids and extrovert adults .
at some point muslims must realize that the world doesn t revolve around them and their inherent hate for anyone and everyone who aren t followers of islam .
stores can and should sell whatever they want , whether it offends them or not .
now , only time will tell how walmart reacts to the insistence that their merchandise is offensive , whether they bow down to a culture that incessantly complains , or cater to the people who shop in their stores and made them a success.via : dmf
