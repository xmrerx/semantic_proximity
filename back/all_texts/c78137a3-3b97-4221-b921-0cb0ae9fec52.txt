Sarah Palin wants to be friends with Julian Assange now since he helped the Russians sabotage Hillary Clinton s campaign.
And the Internet ripped her a new one.When Wikileaks began leaking sensitive documents and information pertaining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the treatment of prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay, Republicans threw a hissy fit.
Sarah Palin even labeled Julian Assange a terrorist, especially after Wikileaks made her emails public.But now that Assange has become the GOP s terrorist, Palin issued a public apology to Assange via Facebook.
[T]he Left having been oh-so-guilty of atrocious actions and attitudes of which they ve falsely accused others.
The media collusion that hid what many on the Left have been supporting is shocking.
This important information that finally opened people s eyes to democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange.I apologize for condemning Assange when he published my infamous (and proven noncontroversial, relatively boring) emails years ago.If Julian Assange had released Donald Trump s emails and helped Hillary win the election, you can bet that Sarah Palin and all of her conservative friends would be calling for his head.And so it was not surprising to see Twitter users humiliate Palin for her hypocrisy.
@AdamWeinstein @SarahPalinUSA When mister Trump says abandon your principles and rest in my non-conservative populism, they say Yes sir Scott (@mrjosco) January 4, 2017@SarahPalinUSA This guy has no love for America and I can t trust him.
Seems like people are putting partisanship politics ahead of country.

Once he decided to shill for your side you found it in your heat to forgive him!
Jon Paul Sapsford (@JonPaulSapsford) January 4, 2017Its almost as if Russia hacked the GOP, decided not to leak the info yet, and now Hannity, Palin, McConnell & Trump have to suck up or else.

He doesn t deserve any praise.
Nate Ellingson (@N_Ellingson) January 4, 2017@SarahPalinUSA Of all the people you should apologize to, you pick Assange?Dear God, what happened to the Right?

Just a few miles from your house to his dacha.
(((Bill Kaz))) (@billkaz2009) January 4, 2017@SarahPalinUSA [Assange] is an anti-American operative with blood on his hands.
