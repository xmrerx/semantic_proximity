Yesterday, after the father of one of the UCLA players arrested in China failed to show Trump proper gratitude for getting his kid released, Trump, predictably, went to Twitter to grouse about it.
He seems to expect to be worshiped for his help on this matter, but LaVar Ball wouldn t do it, so Trump tweeted:Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal.
I should have left them in jail!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017Fox News put that tweet into a meme portraying Trump as a strong, decisive leader and the UCLA basketball players as weaklings, because of course they did.
Then they asked: Do you agree with President Trump?
Yes.
Fox News seriously asked people whether they agree that Trump should have left them in jail because the father of one is refusing to show proper gratitude:Do you agree with President @realDonaldTrump?

He needs adoration- sign of insecurity.
That s why he mocks others.
Worthless.

Shoplifting is a crime but its totally eclipsed by Trump University.
Cody Swan (@Lampliighter) November 20, 2017Yeah, POTUS should only do his job if he gets his ass kissed properly.
Are you high?
Bill Raudenbush (@CandidateBill) November 20, 2017No.
He s a child!
Opinionated (@letmesharewithu) November 20, 2017nah i know what public service means o (@geofftype) November 20, 2017I think he should stop being petty af.
I don t care to hear about this from the President of the United States.
He s so insecure, it s beyond troubling.
Keisha Venezio (@keishhhha) November 20, 2017No, I don t agree pic.twitter.com/7N9KI0oTxl Kelly H (@Kellyk1969) November 20, 2017Do you agree with President @realDonaldTrump?
pic.twitter.com/p3VdoXPxPG Fox News (@FoxNews) November 20, 2017Nope.
I personally would be extraordinarily appreciative if this happened to one of my kids, but i think it s shameful that the prez resents not being thanked enough and doesn t view helping Americans as just part of the job.
Liberal Kansan (@pvliberal) November 20, 2017NO Disgusting & embarrassing!
Melanie (@Melanie03630436) November 20, 2017Well, I m not convinced that he single-handedly got them out of jail so the question isn t really valid Isaac Simonelli (@DiceTravels) November 20, 2017No normal person does.
And YOU know it.
Ernie Page (@AngryHatter) November 20, 2017What?!
This man is a child in a rumpled suit.
In case you haven t noticed, hardly anybody likes him.
: Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others.
pic.twitter.com/ntJzgkdWdz DEMOS..We the people (@Windemere22) November 20, 2017China should have thrown #Dotard @realDonaldTrump into the slammer, chucked the key into the bog & flushed it away.
Holger \_( )_/ (@hnelke1973) November 20, 2017No.
@realDonaldTrump has no idea what it means to do good for the sake of doing good.
He is an empty shell of a man with no moral compass.
Also not my favorite president.
Doreen Graham (@DoreeGraham) November 20, 2017Absolutely not.
The fact that our narcissistic baby in chief can t take any criticism without lashing out is disgraceful.
We deserve better erin o (@erin0331) November 20, 2017Typical trump .. always about himself forgetting America is for all SARA_PDaily (@sarapdaily) November 20, 2017Typical trump .. always about himself forgetting America is for all SARA_PDaily (@sarapdaily) November 20, 2017Why would anyone agree with this shit?
Remember when we mourned the death of the student who died in NK and now we re talking about this?
Aditya Sharma (@adityaksharma) November 20, 2017No I do not agree with Donald.
As a matter of fact, I wish he was left in the hospital at the time of his birth.
