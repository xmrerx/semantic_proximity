this is great because hillary clinton is never asked questions like this one : um , you said earlier that you wanted to end corruption , but how can you do that after the whitewater scandals , benghazi and the deleted emails ?
hillary s response : well , i wish you d go back and read the history of 1990s , because clearly uh , there , there were unfortunately a lot of partisans who uh , thought that the best way to work uh , with my husband s administration was through attacks of all kinds all of which washed out .
soooo it was the vast right-wing conspiracy ?
that s a pretty pitiful answer
