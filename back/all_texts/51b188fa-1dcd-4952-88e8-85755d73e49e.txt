Sources from inside Donald Trump s campaign told ABC News on Sunday that because the Republican nominee has f*cked up so much in the past couple of weeks, his own advisers are starting to fear that he is deliberately trying to lose.
Correspondent Jonathan Karl said during a panel discussion on ABC s This Week that supporters are afraid that Trump is purposely undermining his own campaign following weeks of one ghastly mistake after another: Let s be honest, he does face a hostile news media.
And that s not surprising.
We have a candidate who bans news organizations from his events, a candidate who calls the press despicable and disgusting, a candidate who in every single stump speech I ve ever seen has lashed out at the press.
But, according to Karl, it isn t just supporters who are now convinced Trump is sabotaging his own campaign.
Even advisers inside of his campaign are now becoming concerned that he is intentionally shooting himself in the foot.
But Donald Trump s problems are not because of media coverage.
I ve talked to people in the past week people who are very much on the Trump train advisers outside the campaign, even some advisers inside the campaign who think that it as almost as if Donald Trump is trying to lose.There is absolute frustration in his inability to get on message and win a race that many of them believe is eminently winnable.
Trump has indeed had a bad couple of weeks.
From attacking Gold Star families to encouraging Russian espionage to casually suggesting the assassination of his rival, Hillary Clinton, the billionaire bully has certainly managed to f*ck up good and proper.Watch the segment here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhknX6zg_u4]Featured image via video screen capture
