warsaw ( reuters ) - poland is ready to defend its decision in the european union s top court to refuse to accept migrants from africa and the middle east under an eu plan to redistribute them , deputy foreign minister konrad szymanski said .
he spoke after the eu executive sued poland , hungary and the czech republic in the european court of justice on thursday for their refusal to host these migrants .
poland is ready to defend its position in the court , szymanski told state news agency pap .
no one will lift the duty of providing public safety from the polish government .
the government of poland s right-wing law and justice ( pis ) party has said it will not admit migrants , citing security concerns amid deadly islamist attacks in western europe and problems with ascertaining the identify of migrants .
the foreign ministry said on wednesday it had signed a deal with the european investment bank to give 50 million euros to help countries and territories affected by the migration crisis , mainly lebanon , jordan and the west bank .
foreign minister witold waszczykowski said that poland - a country of 38 million - is already hosting migrants as it had issued more than a million work permits for people from neighboring ukraine last year alone .
