the guy who wasn t funny enough to land the coveted tonight show gig after johnny carson retired , is now saying president donald trump , the most successful business man in new york city s history , couldn t keep a job at dairy queen .
does anyone else remember the last time leftist former comedian david letterman was funny ?
yeah , neither do we former late-night television show host david letterman says that people need to stop whining about president donald trump and instead figure out a way to remove him from office.speaking in an interview monday with the associated press , letterman said he s tired of people , daily , nightly , on all the cable news shows telling us there s something wrong .
instead , letterman said , i just think we ought to direct our resources and our energies to doing something about it .
if the guy ( trump ) was running dairy queen , he d be gone , letterman said .
this guy couldn t work at the gap .
so why do we have to be victimized by his fecklessness , his ignorance ?
trump s behavior , the former television host said , is insulting to the country .
fox newsisn t it funny that david letterman didn t have any issues with inviting donald trump to appear on his show when he wanted the ratings .
in fact , donald trump appeared a number of times on the letterman show and was always a good sport .
little did he know , comrade david was only using him to get ratings fortunately for david letterman , donald trump was always a great guest on his show .
here s a clip from a 1988 appearance .
the interview starts at the 15:50 minute mark : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gmnn2mcj-7u
