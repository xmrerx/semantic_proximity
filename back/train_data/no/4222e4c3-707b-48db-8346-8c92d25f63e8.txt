wow just wow ! a pregnant woman has challenged pro life activists to pay her $ 1 million to keep her baby.in an anonymous essay titled how much would you pay to stop an abortion ?
, the writer claims she is 26 years old , seven weeks pregnant , with every intention of aborting her fetus.but if she receives $ 1 million in 72 hours she will allegedly have the baby , put it up for adoption , and put every cent into a trust fund for the child to access at 21.otherwise , every donation will be returned and she will go through with the abortion she has scheduled for july 10.donations will be accepted from midnight july 7.writing one-page website called prolifeantiwoman.com , the woman says the rallying cry is a protest against extremely restrictive abortion laws recently passed in the state where she attends graduate school.the laws , she writes , require women to wait 72 hours after a doctor consultation to have an abortion.north carolina became the fourth state to assume a law of that nature last month , following missouri , south dakota , and utah.she continues : the laws impose unnecessary waiting time to get an abortion and attempt to enforce rules that bypass the doctor/patient privacy privilege .
i now feel more comfortable traveling to my home state to get an abortion than i do trying to get one here .
the essay concludes : i hope to give the american public a concrete example that the conservative right in america doesn t actually care about the life of a child , they care about controlling the lives and choices of women .
we have to acknowledge this and we have to stop it .
