Jake Tapper gave an Oscar-worthy performance with his fake concern for most Americans who he claims are thinking President Trump is unfit for office .
He jumped on comments made by Sen. Bob Corker last week, when Corker suggested that he doubted Trump s stability and competence.
The left is thrilled with this idiotic comment from Corker Tapper and the Dems will ride this narrative for as long as they can!Tapper announced: According to a new Quinnipiac University poll released this afternoon, voters overwhelmingly saying President Trump is not level-headed, 68 percent to 29 percent.
Voters saying President Trump does not provide the U.S. with moral leadership, 62 to 35 percent.
That he s not honest, 61 to 36 percent.
Voters believe by a two to one margin that President Trump is doing more to divide the country than to unite it, 62 to 31 percent.
Nearly six in 10 voters say President Trump s decisions and behavior have encouraged white supremacist groups.
Now President Trump is a man who looks to numbers and to ratings.
These numbers, sir, these numbers are disastrous.
Tapper concluded with his effort to speak for the majority of Americans according to some poll: You are no doubt pleasing your base, but your behavior is causing great concern among the majority of the American people.
