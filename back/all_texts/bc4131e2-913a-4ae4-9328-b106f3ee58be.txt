WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate National Football League team owner Woody Johnson as U.S. ambassador to Britain, the White House said on Thursday.
Johnson, a billionaire investor and owner of the New York Jets, will require Senate confirmation to take up the diplomatic post.
Johnson’s nomination does not come as a surprise.
In January, Trump referred to Johnson as “ambassador” during remarks at a luncheon and said the NFL team owner was “going to St. James.”
