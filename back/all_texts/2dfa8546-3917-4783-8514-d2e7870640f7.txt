This police officer is a class act.
He went to the Trump rally just to check it out and see what he had to say.
He was expecting Trump to be a lot more radical than he was.
He came in being an undecided voter and left being a Trump supporter.
His story mirrors our Trump rally story in Sterling Heights, MI.
The people inside the rally waited a long time to see Trump and the room was becoming very hot and uncomfortable.
The people in attendance who were there to really hear what he had to say were very respectful of each other.
It wasn t until the planted (and likely paid) protesters started screaming at people leaving the event that things got ugly.Brandon Tatum, an officer in the Tucson Police Department, shared a video Saturday night giving his perspective on Donald Trump s campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona and the disruptive protesters who hurled obscenities at the Republican candidate.Tatum says that as a black man, he did not feel unsafe around Trump s supporters but was ready to fight protesters in self-defense.
He calls them the most hateful, evil people he has ever seen.
The demonstrators, who he recalls chanting the phrase Black lives matter, used profane language and gestures, leading a mother to cover her child s ears.My experience at Donald Trump s rally in Tucson, AZ.
