february 12 , is the 207th anniversary of president abraham lincoln s birth , and twitter decided to celebrate it like only the social media giant can : with a hilarious hashtag.if you are an avid social networking user , then you have probably come across a quote attributed to president lincoln or some other famous historical figure and thought , he definitely didn t say that .
it happens so often that it s an internet joke , just slap a quote next to someone notable s face and you have a viral internet meme shared by thousands ( sometimes millions ) of really stupid people .
president lincoln is often the person in many of those memes , so twitter users decided to celebrate his birthday with # thingslincolndidntsay : i m excited for the future of my party .

it is true , he was a republican , but if he were alive today there is absolutely no doubt that he d be considered a filthy liberal.the gop is always trying to divide our country , especially the far-right anti-government tea party crazies .
president lincoln , on the other hand , went to war to keep the country from splitting apart that s how much he loved the union .
so it s pretty safe to say that he would not support the confederate flag waving , bundy militia supporting , obama-hating republican party of 2016 .
i will leave you with an actual quote from the sixteenth president , one that the right needs to remember : a house divided against itself can not stand .
i believe this government can not endure permanently half-slave and half-free .
i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided .
it will become all one thing or all the other .
happy birthday , president lincoln !
