there is a hashtag trending on twitter in protest of maureen dowd , a prominent , white op-ed columnist for the new york times who called president obama barry .
the op-ed is called the clinton contamination , but makes a point of disrespecting president obama with that racist , derogatory nickname .
right-wingers decided they needed to co-opt the tag to attack the left on twitter , proving that they really do think everything is about them.some of them insisted that they were just trying to keep the conversation on hillary and her many imagined crimes , while others went full birther , and full racist on obama himself .
there are plenty of tweets from liberals attacking conservatives , too , but it s very telling that conservatives refuse to see that dowd s use of the nickname , barry , is intentionally spoken with racist overtones. # fraudbarry grew up muslim , mass imported muslims , & facilitated terrorhe s a terrorist # presidentobamanotbarry pic.twitter.com/azxnwgztpv jared wyand ( @ jaredwyand ) july 10 , 2016 i will not show respect to barry as he is someone who routinely disrespects my intelligence , history , and people # presidentobamanotbarry appalachian son ( @ kinfolkfirst ) july 10 , 2016 ( because white southerners are such an oppressed group of people , are they not ?

# presidentobamanotbarry annie # nevertrump ( @ bloodless_coup ) july 10 , 2016i know the left needs constant distractions to keep its latent internal divisions from tearing it apart , but c mon # presidentobamanotbarry yung harambe ( @ trumphat ) july 10 , 2016 barry had the perfect opportunity to unite this country .
instead he created a race war .
# presidentobamanotbarry joe ( @ patriotinoc ) july 10 , 2016 ( white racists who spew hateful rhetoric against the entire black community can t possibly be the problem here .
) # presidentobamanotbarry is a hashtag that offends people ?
people should be more offended by a potus that lies constantly & divides you .
latiffani ( @ latiffani1 ) july 10 , 2016 i don t normally rail against political correctness but # presidentobamanotbarry is a politically correct cover up for # clintoncontamination .

# presidentobamanotbarry 01000110 01010101 ( @ hitman0321 ) july 10 , 2016 barry hussein obama doesn t deserve respect .
he s a traitor. # presidentobamanotbarry patrick henry ( @ fightnowamerica ) july 10 , 2016there are , of course , some saying that calling george w. bush dubya , bill clinton slick willie , and richard nixon tricky dick are exactly the same as calling obama barry .
here s why they aren t : barry is what the birthers were calling obama way back when they started their racist birther horse pucks .
it carries a racist connotation because the birther movement made it that way.besides that , w. may have been created as a way to distinguish george w. from his father , george h.w .
way back in the 1970s .
tricky dick and slick willie , while disrespectful , weren t created with racist intentions .
but racists can t be expected to understand that .
they re the most put-upon demographic in the nations.so after dubya , slick willie , tricky dick , etc. , you re telling me barry s off the table ?
go find better outrages .
# presidentobamanotbarry thomas keister ( @ thomaskeister ) july 10 , 2016 so can we also not use honest abe , bill , or dubya ?
just saying .
# presidentobamanotbarry amanda johnson ( @ ama_ro_jo ) july 10 , 2016didnt everyone call bush dubya ?
dont obama s own supporters call him barry ?
yall need to calm down & make memes .
# presidentobamanotbarry jackie from allstate ( @ allstatejackie ) july 10 , 2016 george bush was called w and not a fuck was given .
get over your silly-assed outrage # presidentobamanotbarry brian hammons ( @ briham8 ) july 10 , 2016the creator of the hashtag , peter daou , stuck around on twitter to explain why he created it in the first place , as well as defend it .
there were others , too , who pointed out that this is possibly the worst time to run an op-ed that uses an intentionally racially-charged nickname for our first black president.i created # presidentobamanotbarry because a prominent white nyt columnist calling our first black potus barry is profoundly disrespectful .
peter daou ( @ peterdaou ) july 10 , 2016 it s demeaning , disrespectful of the office , belittling and racially-tinged .
does that help ?
# presidentobamanotbarry https : //t.co/tfbusvzn3i peter daou ( @ peterdaou ) july 10 , 2016considering profound race issues facing u.s. , @ nytimes should apologize for allowing @ nytimesdowd to refer to @ potus as barry .
a disgrace .
peter daou ( @ peterdaou ) july 10 , 2016 after this week in america ?
no , @ nytimesdowd just no .
# presidentobamanotbarry gnu bangs ( @ gopsux2 ) july 10 , 2016dowd referring to potus as barry in the clinton contamination attempts to further divide us after a tragic week .
# presidentobamanotbarry kaivan shroff ( @ kaivanshroff ) july 10 , 2016 tell maureen dowd she ought to refer to president obama with respect , especially at a time like this # presidentobamanotbarry @ nytimesdowd millennials4hillary ( @ stillwithher ) july 10 , 2016as of the time of this posting , # presidentobamanotbarry had well over 28,000 tweets , and was the second top trending hashtag on twitter .
by contrast , # clintoncontamination was a distant fourth .
