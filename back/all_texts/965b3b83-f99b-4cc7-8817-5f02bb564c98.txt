LONDON (Reuters) - The longer it takes for Britain and the European Union to start negotiations on their future relationship after Brexit, the higher the chance of a no deal scenario, trade minister Liam Fox said on Wednesday.
I think it s unreasonable (not to move the Brexit talks forward) given the business interests across the European Union and given the interests of international investors, Fox told a committee of lawmakers.
The trouble is that the later these discussions begin, the higher the chance of not reaching a deal on time become.
