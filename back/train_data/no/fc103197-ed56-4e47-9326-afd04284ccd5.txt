if anyone were to tell you 20 years ago that a career criminal , habitual liar and an enabler of husband who is a serial sexual offender was going to be a frontrunner for president of the united states in two decades simply because of her genitalia , would you have believed them ? while the state department s own internal probe found former secretary hillary clinton violated federal recordkeeping laws , it s not the first time she and her top aides shielded her e-mail from public disclosure while serving in a government position.as first lady , hillary was embroiled in another scheme to bury sensitive white house e-mails , known internally as project x .
in 1999 , as investigators looked into whitewater , travelgate , filegate and other scandals involving the then-first lady , it was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed e-mails were mysteriously lost due to a glitch in a west wing computer server.the massive hole in white house archives covered a critical two-year period 1996 to 1998 when republicans and special prosecutor ken starr were subpoenaing white house e-mails.despite separate congressional investigations and a federal lawsuit over project x , high-level e-mails dealing with several scandals were never turned over .
and the full scope of bill and hillary clintons culpability in the parade of scandals was never known.to those well-versed in clinton shenanigans , this all sounds distressingly familiar .

they fingered white house special assistant laura crabtree callahan , who was overseeing the computer contractors despite obtaining computer-science degrees from diploma mills.read more : nyp
