Today I had a tooth shaved down because crippling anxiety makes me grind and rock my teeth on one side.
I blame trump.

The best part is that Teigen not only blames Trump for Botox injections, but would also like him to pay for them.I also had Botox in my jaw muscle to relieve tension from constantly clinching.
I was not like this before.
