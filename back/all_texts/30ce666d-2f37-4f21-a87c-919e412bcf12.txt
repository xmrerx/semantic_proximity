It only seems fitting that an openly immoral group would attach their wagon to the wife of the most sexually deviant President to ever occupy the White House As Hillary gears up for the Nevada caucus, her supporters are drumming up support in a bid to avoid another crushing defeat by Bernie Sanders.This includes one, not-so conventional group who have had her back since she announced her candidacy back on April 12.Hookers for Hillary are back out on the road in a bid to help the Democratic candidate to a much-needed victory.The group of prostitutes work at the legal brothel, the Moonlite Bunny Ranch near Carson City, which is owned by Dennis Hof, who made headlines after Lamar Odom was found unconscious in one of his establishments last year.The campaign was his idea, and his employees have his backing.
Entice Love, a 26-year-old mother of two from Sacramento, who works at the ranch told The Guardian: I m for Hillary because she s cracking down on domestic violence.Many of them chose their profession, which is illegal in the other 49 U.S. states, to get health insurance for themselves and their families.Some suffer health problems that require expensive medication.
Taylor Lee, a 26-year-old from Houston, told The Guardian her job at the Moonlite Ranch helped her keep up with payments for epilepsy pills which cost $10 a piece.However she admitted she was pushed to vote for Hillary, but will be caucusing for rival Sanders.

Sounds like it could be a suitable retirement choice for Bill .
