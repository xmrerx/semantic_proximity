washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. senate voted on wednesday to confirm dr. robert califf as commissioner of the food and drug administration , an agency that regulates everything from food and drugs to tobacco , cosmetics and dietary supplements .
califf , 64 , is a well-regarded cardiologist and researcher who takes the helm at the fda at a time it is under pressure from lawmakers to speed the approval process for drugs and medical devices and finalize a proposed rule giving it authority to regulate e-cigarettes .
the agency is also attempting to implement sweeping new regulations to improve food safety , and has begun to tackle the approval process for biosimilars , which are cheaper versions of biologic drugs .
califf ’ s nomination was opposed by the democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders , who said califf ’ s ties to the pharmaceutical industry made him unfit to regulate the industry impartially .
it was also opposed by several senators who believe the agency needs to do more to combat opioid addiction .
several senators , including democrat edward markey of massachusetts and joe manchin of west virginia , took the opportunity leading up to the vote to lambaste the fda for what they said was a lax approach to approving potentially addictive opioid painkillers .
