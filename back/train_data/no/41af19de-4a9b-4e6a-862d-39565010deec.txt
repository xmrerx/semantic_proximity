chris cuomo of fake news network cnn interviewed kellyanne conway on sunday .
you would have thought by now , these hacks at cnn would have figured out they are no match for the brilliant kellyanne conway .
at the opening of his interview with conway , cuomo attempted to convince the few viewers who still watch cnn that president trump was very squishy on his meeting with vladimir putin .
kellyanne conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way , chris , let s back up .
so you re saying you used the word squishy which , itself , is unusual to describe the president s state of mind .
so somehow that makes people on cnn insist that the president is never going to raise this with putin ?
why are they still in there ?
cuomo responded , it s not about cnn .
it s about what the president said , kellyanne .
kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host chris cuomo when she asked him , aren t you the least bit reluctant , if not embarrassed that you now talk about russia more than you talk about america ?
cuomo went on to discuss the nothing-burger story about a meeting donald trump jr. had with a russian lawyer prior to the election .
the lawyer allegedly claimed he had information about individuals connected to russian that were funding the dnc and hillary .
it turns out she was a human rights lawyer who wanted to talk about adoption .
but cnn , who suffers from trump-russia collusion obsession , is clinging to this story like a squirrel protects its only nut in the dead of winter .
again , conway delivered another knock out blow saying , you keep on saying opposition research the way you guys constantly vomit words like collusion and russian interference and affecting the election , all of which you have no evidence .
we can not convert wishful thinking into hard evidence .
