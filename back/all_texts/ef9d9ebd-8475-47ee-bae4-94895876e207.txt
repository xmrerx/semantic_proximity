PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech government will seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 10, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Wednesday after his cabinet was sworn in.
Babis s ANO party finished first in a national election in October but has failed to attract other parties to join a coalition and has formed a minority cabinet instead.
It has yet to secure a parliamentary majority for the confidence vote.
