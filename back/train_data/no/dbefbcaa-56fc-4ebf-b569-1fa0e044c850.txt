london ( reuters ) - a record majority of britons disapprove of prime minister theresa may s handling of brexit talks and they are increasingly skeptical that leaving the eu will make the country better off , an opinion poll showed on tuesday .
orb international said 66 percent of people disapproved of the government s conduct of the negotiations , up from 64 percent last month .
the poll also showed only 27 percent were confident that may will get the right deal , compared with 47 percent who were not confident .
trust in may s handling of brexit has evaporated since she gambled away her parliamentary majority in an election in june .
with only 17 months left until britain is due to exit the european union , the lack of clear progress in the negotiations has raised fears of an abrupt departure with no transition that businesses say they need .
for the first time , more britons disagreed that brexit will help the economy than agreed , orb said .
there is no sign that the prime minister is beginning to turn things around when it comes to brexit , orb said in a statement .
overall these poll findings provide little encouragement for a prime minister facing multiple battles .
as well as trying to breath life into brexit talks , may is dealing with a growing sexual harassment scandal in britain s parliament .
without an overall majority , may can not afford to lose parliamentary seats .
businesses have expressed alarm at the progress of brexit talks .
on monday , the chartered institute of procurement and supply said nearly two-thirds of european businesses planned to cut back orders from british suppliers .
last month finance minister philip hammond said a transition deal needed to be struck by early 2018 .
