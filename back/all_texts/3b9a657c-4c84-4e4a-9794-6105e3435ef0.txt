Zero Hedge In a shocking development, late on Saturday the Saudi press reported that prominent billionaire, member of the royal Saudi family, and one of the biggest shareholders of Citi, News Corp. and Twitter not to mention frequent CNBC guest Al-Waleed bin Talal, along with ten senior princes, and some 38 ministers, has been arrested for corruption and money laundering charges on orders from the new anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, while Royal princes private planes have been grounded.Among those fired and/or arrested are the head of National Royal Guards, Miteb Bin Abdullah, the Minister of Economy and Planning, Adel Fakeih, and Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan, the Commander of the Saudi Naval Forces.As the local press further adds, the supreme committee chaired by Crown Prince and billionaire stops on charges of money laundering.

Guard); media moguls; SAGIA & financial policy officials have been purged.As Bloomberg notes, changing the head of the National Guard, an institution that s been controlled by the clan of the late King Abdullah, is not like changing the minister of oil, said Kamran Bokhari, a senior analyst with Geopolitical Futures and a senior fellow with the Center for Global Policy.
