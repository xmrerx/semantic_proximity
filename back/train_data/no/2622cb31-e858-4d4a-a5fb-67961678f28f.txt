it s funny how things work out the fbi scapegoats hillary s crimes by using the excuse of her concussion , blood clots and memory loss .
well , if she wants to be president then she needs to prove to the american people that she s recovered and capable right ? zero hedge with much of the recent discussion focusing on hillary clinton s general health condition , and mental acuity in particular , we wonder if the fbi just threw her under the bus with the following statement which links hillary s inability to remember her transition instructions with her 2012 concussion and blood clot : clinton stated she received no instructions or direction regarding the preservation or production of records from state during the transition out of her role as secretary of state in early 2013 .
however , in december of 2012 , clinton suffered a concussion and then around the new year had a blood clot .
based on her doctor s advice , she could only work at state for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received .
clinton did not have any discussions with aides about turning over her email records , nor did anyone from state request them .
she believed her work-related emails were captured by her practice of sending email to the state.gov email address of her staff .
clinton was unaware of the requirement to turn over printed records at that time .
her physical records were boxed up and handled by aides .
