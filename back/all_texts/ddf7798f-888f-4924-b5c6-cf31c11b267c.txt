MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that ties with U.S. President Donald Trump s administration were not without problems, but he hoped that mutual interests of Russia and the United States in fighting terrorism would help improve Moscow s relations with Washington.
Some forces are making use of Russian-American relations to resolve internal political problems in the United States, Putin told an energy forum in Moscow.
I believe that such a person like Trump, with his character, will never be hostage to someone s interests.
Moscow has lots of friends in the United States who genuinely want to improve relations with Russia, Putin added.
