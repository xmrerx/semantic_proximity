we re conducting a full review to understand what transpired .
we are taking allegations of discrimination very seriously ; our culture requires treating others with respect .
saleh has more than 1.6 million subscribers to his truestoryasa youtube channel , and more than 2.2 million subscribers to his adam saleh vlogs youtube channel .
saleh s youtube channels are full of prank videos as well as videos about muslim life , and he is a self-described professional idiot .
