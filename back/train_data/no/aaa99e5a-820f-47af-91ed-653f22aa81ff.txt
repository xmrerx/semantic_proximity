amsterdam ( reuters ) - a man with a palestinian flag yelling god is great was detained by police in the netherlands on thursday after smashing the windows of a kosher jewish restaurant in amsterdam .
the violent outburst came a day after u.s. president donald trump recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel , a decision that reversed decades of u.s. foreign policy , angered much of the muslim world and was widely rejected by western leaders .
the assailant , who was wearing a black-and-white-checkered head scarf , smashed several windows of the restaurant hacarmel before he was pushed to the ground and hand-cuffed by police , a video of the incident posted on local media websites showed .
we are disgusted , the organization of jewish communities in the netherlands said in a statement .
the attack was an act of revenge , meant to instil fear , and is no less than an act of terror .
