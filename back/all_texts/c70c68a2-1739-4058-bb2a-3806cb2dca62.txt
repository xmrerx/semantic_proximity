Shark Tank star and insanely successful real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran has known Republican nominee Donald Trump for over three decades and she recently showed that there s no one better to drop a truth bomb on America about who The Donald really is.In an epic interview with Erin Burnett, Corcoran added more weight to the allegations of the twelve women who have come forward against Trump, claiming that the business mogul sexually assaulted them.
Corcoran admitted that she saw inappropriate behavior from Trump quite often, and she was even the victim of his misogynistic, degrading behavior at one point in time.Corcoran admitted that when she was pregnant, Trump began talking excessively about her breasts while they were in a business meeting.
Corcoran recalled the time Trump sexualized and objectified her: I was pregnant with my first child at the time.
So was his second wife [Marla Maples].
And he compared my breast size to his wife by putting his hands in the air, telling me how large they are.
If a man is that way so inappropriate I just assume it s that way all the time.
Corcoran showed solidarity with Trump s victims and not only said that she believed them, but said she thought it was preposterous that he s claiming he s done nothing like that.
The popular investor also said she hoped she was wrong about her earlier prediction that Trump might win the election, noting that she thinks he will self-destruct before he gets any closer to the White House.You can watch Corcoran blow the lid off Trump s lies below:Corcoran is now the second Shark Tank investor to rail against Trump, following billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been destroying Trump every chance he gets for the last several weeks.Featured image via Frederick M.
