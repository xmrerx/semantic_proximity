manila ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump raised north korea s missile tests during talks on monday with the prime ministers of japan and australia , and said a lot of progress had been made in negotiations on trade .
on the sidelines of a summit of east and southeast asian leaders in manila , trump met with japan s shinzo abe and australia s malcolm turnbull , and said discussions at the meeting would include tensions on the korean peninsula and trade .
in brief remarks prior to news media being ushered out of the meeting , turnbull said north korea s recklessness needed to be stopped , while abe said the most immediate challenge was to ensure regional peace and stability .
following the meeting , the white house said the three leaders reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining maximum pressure on north korea in the effort to denuclearize the korean peninsula .
they also discussed expanded security cooperation for enhanced deterrence and defense against north korean aggression , the white house said in a statement .
the three men also discussed the need for free and open trade in the indo-pacific region and the need to pursue fair and reciprocal trade , the white house added .
trump , who campaigned heavily on u.s. trade issues , made pulling out of the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) asian trade deal one of his first acts in office .
his administration has instead pledged to reach bilateral pacts with individual nations .
countries remaining in the pact have said the deal is advancing without the united states .
