singapore ( reuters ) - singapore has banned two muslim foreign preachers from entering the city-state because their views bred intolerance and were a risk to its social harmony , the government said on monday .
the decision to block ismail menk , identified by local media as a zimbabwean and haslin bin baharim as a malaysian , is the latest move by the singaporean authorities to put a curb on individuals from spreading divisive views .
menk has preached muslims are not allowed to greet people of other faiths on their religious festivals , singapore s home affairs ministry said in a statement .
it accused baharim of holding views that promote discord between muslims and non-muslims , whom he described as deviant .
( their views ) are unacceptable in the context of singapore s multi-racial and multi-religious society , the ministry said .
reuters was not in a position to reach out to the pair .
singapore is predominantly chinese , many of whom follow buddhism and taoism but 14 percent of the population is muslim and nearly 19 percent christian .
authorities in the city-state , an outpost of stability in a region where religious tension is not uncommon , are sensitive to public remarks they deem might adversely affect religious and social harmony .
over the past few years , singapore increased its level of surveillance for islamist radicalism as concern grew about the spread of islamic state in the region .
menk and baharim planned to conduct religious sessions on a ship departing from singapore next month after their applications for short-term work passes to preach in singapore were turned down , the government said .
they will not be allowed to get around the ban by preaching instead on cruise ships which operate to and from singapore , the home ministry said .
last month , authorities said they rejected applications for two foreign christian preachers to speak in singapore as they had made denigrating and inflammatory comments of other religions .
