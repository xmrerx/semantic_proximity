About a month ago, people started noticing a large black man who always seemed to rush to Hillary s aid during coughing fits, or when she exhibits bizarre behavior.Hillary's Handler?
Brain washer?

We re just wondering where Trump s special handler has been hiding all year?
Maybe he doesn t need one because he s a perfectly healthy and capable candidate .Just something to consider
