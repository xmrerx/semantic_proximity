PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen threatened on Monday that the main opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, would be dissolved if it continues to back detained leader Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason.
Kem Sokha was arrested on Sept. 3 and accused of plotting against the government with the help of the United States.
If the political party continues to blockade and defend this traitor, it means the party is also a traitor so there is no time to let this party operate in Cambodia s democratic process anymore, Hun Sen told a graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh.
He said that, if the act of treason involved the whole party, it would be disciplined by law, which means the dissolution of the party .
