President Obama made a surprise appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert after Super Bowl 50 concluded and didn t come unprepared.
While carrying a football with him, he also came with a few jokes as well.
Nobody knew he d be on the show, so it was definitely a shock to everyone watching.
President Obama: After every Super Bowl, I call the winning team to congratulate them, and sometimes I also call the losing team, especially if I bet on them.Colbert: Sir, I hate to break this to you, but betting is illegal.President Obama: Ehh, I m the president.
I hereby pardon myself.Colbert: Okay, fair enough.When he first came on the show via a video feed, it wasn t clear to the audience that the show wasn t being cast live.
That soon became very obvious after a few more moments.
They actually pre-recorded the interaction an entire week ago.He then made a few jokes about every Super Bowl winner being put on the back of the U.S. Constitution.
We re sure a few conservatives out there will take that as an opportunity to take a few jabs at the president for not knowing the Constitution.
To them we say, lighten up.Colbert: So, let me get this straght, you don t even know who won the game, sir?President Obama: Of course, I do.
It was the Denver Broncos.Colbert: What?
If this is a pre-tape, how could you possibly know that?President Obama: Stephen, I am the president and it turns out all the Super Bowl winners for the next 50 years are written on the back of the Constitution.
That s the plot of National Treasure 3.
After throwing the football to First Lady Michelle Obama, she can be seen doing her very best touchdown dance in a room full of kids.
Turns out, Mr. Obama isn t supposed to be throwing footballs in the White House.
Mr. President, shame on you.Featured image via screen capture.
