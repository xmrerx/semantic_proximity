Donald Trump keeps digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole where Russia is concerned.
His entire term has been plagued by a steady drip of leaks regarding his shady Russian ties.
The latest revelation to become front page news is that his son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, was trying to establish a secret line of communication between Trump and the Kremlin.Not surprisingly, administration officials are pushing for Kushner to step aside and take a leave of absence amid his current Russian scandal.
According to ABC News, members of Trump s inner circle are saying it might be time for Jared Kushner to take a leave of absence from the White House.
Last week, it was announced that Kushner had come under intense scrutiny by the FBI because of his suspicious contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as well as a Russian banking executive.
Then the Washington Post reported on Friday that Kushner had been attempting to set up a back channel of communication between Trump and Moscow.To call this news a bombshell (a term that has become a cliche with Trump in the White House) would be an understatement.
Former intelligence officials, with decades of experience, say they had never seen anything like this before and described the news as off the map, explosive, and extremely dangerous.
Both Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn were forced to resign when news broke of their Russian ties.
