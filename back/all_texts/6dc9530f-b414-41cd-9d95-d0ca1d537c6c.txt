On Tuesday, Republican front runner Donald Trump made the horrendous mistake of dissing leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, saying that she was unqualified to be a candidate and that she only had the woman s card to help her win over voters.Specifically, Trump had said, The only thing she s got going is the woman s card.
And the beautiful thing is, women don t like her.
He also added that if Clinton were a man, she would only get 5 percent of the vote.
(Obviously, Trump has forgotten about all of these qualifications and accomplishments Clinton has worked for over the years).Later that day, NBC host Rachel Maddow properly ripped Trump for his comments, pointing out what an idiot he was for continuing his long history of misogynistic, sexist comments and pushing female voters even further away.
Maddow told co-host Brian Williams: As our colleague and friend Nicolle Wallace pointed out earlier this evening, Donald Trump does have a general election problem.
Even if he gets this nomination, even if everything goes the way it has been for him during the primary as he heads toward the general election, he brings with him a big problem with women voters.To say about the woman that you re running against that the only reason she s in the race is because she s a woman that her achievement is basically the result of some sort of affirmative action, some favor being paid to her as a woman and that as a human being she is patently unqualified when she is the former two-term senator from New York and the former secretary of state and has the experience that she s had, I do think that even a lot of Republican women will read that wrong.
It s literally baffling and somewhat amusing to think that Trump believes that female voters would connect with a sexist, misogynist candidate like himself.
What Trump may not realize is that women actually hate him WAY more than they dislike Clinton.
According to a survey by Morning Consult, a nonpartisan firm, only 39% of women view Clinton unfavorably, compared to a whopping 52% for Trump.You can watch Maddow blast Trump below:Featured image via screen capture
