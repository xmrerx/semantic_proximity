is there any level to which trump s press secretary , sean spicer , will not sink on behalf of his lying boss ?
it seems not .
in another press conference today , he addressed the sheer size and scope of the women s marches , which took place all over the world , and said that they weren t protesting against trump : a lot of these people were there to protest an issue of concern to them and not against anything .
yeah , sure , alternative facts aren t facts and people aren t buying the alternative facts that spicer and trump have to sell .
the women s marches were absolutely about trump , his election , and his misogyny women were sending him a message that we will not tolerate any efforts to step up oppression of us.that s reflected in the way twitter responded to spicer : @ seanspicer i travelled 1200 miles to dc from nebraska for the women s march , and every marcher i spoke to along the way was anti-trump .

@ seanspicer said the women s march was about various issues , not necessarily against anything .
this was 1.5 blocks from the white house pic.twitter.com/apiixeqhfe george zornick ( @ gzornick ) january 23 , 2017recurring chant at the boston women s march : hey ho , hey ho , donald trump has got to go @ seanspicer norahbrink ( @ nbrink77 ) january 23 , 2017oh please sean spicer do mansplain the women s march to us ( ( ( rachel sklar ) ) ) ( @ rachelsklar ) january 23 , 2017or if you ve attended the sean spicer school of maths , about 11 people participated in the women s march .
https : //t.co/ktasdgsugz patrick swagger ( @ theswagger ) january 23 , 2017 @ seanspicer facts are facts .
alternative facts are lies .
the women s march was against trump-and that s a fact .
arlene fischhoff ( @ kabfmd ) january 23 , 2017in other words , spicer ought to give it up .
it s absurd that people have to take to twitter to correct the white house press secretary on the lies he tells on behalf of his witless wonder of a lying boss.sir ian mckellan , who participated in the women s march in london , picked up a sign near trafalgar square that perfectly epitomizes how we re all reacting to spicer and trump : when is someone going to attend a presser with rotten tomatoes to throw at spicer ? featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
