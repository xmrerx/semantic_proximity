dublin ( reuters ) - the brexit agreement on the irish border that assures northern ireland will remain aligned with the european union s customs union and single market puts a floor under what is possible in negotiations on trade after britain leaves the eu , ireland s foreign minister said .
what it means is any deal that is done has to be better than the default position , otherwise we won t be able to agree it , simon coveney told national broadcaster rte after the deal was struck early on friday .
i think what that does is , it puts a floor under what is possible in terms of the outcome that we can t fall below , so ireland obviously has a huge interest in the phase two negotiations .
