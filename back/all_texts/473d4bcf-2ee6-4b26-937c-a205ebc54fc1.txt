WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a “very good” phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday and agreed to work to improve ties after a meeting between the two leaders was scrapped amid a dispute over funding Trump’s planned border wall.
“We had a very good call.
I have been very strong on Mexico.
I have great respect for Mexico ... but, as you know, Mexico with the United States has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders.
They’ve made us look foolish,” Trump told a news conference at the White House.
Trump said the call was friendly and he looked forward to renegotiating the U.S. trade relationship with Mexico in the future.
