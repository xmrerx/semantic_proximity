the slippery slope continues college park is just the latest city in maryland to propose that illegals be given the right to vote in local elections .
if you re not outraged by this , we d love to know why not .
once you start allowing non-citizens to decide on anything within your city , doesn t this preclude the legal citizens from receiving their lawful voting rights ? this is not unconstitutional but it is unamerican ! college park , md .
is weighing whether or not to allow illegals to vote in local elections.officials in college park , which is home to the university of maryland s main campus , have yet to make their final decision , the baltimore sun reports.opponents say immigrants even those in the country legally , such as green-card holders should not be able to have a say in the direction of the community until they complete the process of becoming a citizen.the measure s sponsor , city councilwoman christine nagle , said it would be good for noncitizens living in the city to make decisions regarding local services .
these are folks who have a significant stake in our community , and who rely on the facilities in our city , nagle said .
to me , it just made sense .
college park would not be the only city in the state to allow noncitizens to vote : takoma park , md .
has allowed noncitizens to vote since 1991 , and two towns in montgomery county have done the same .
other maryland towns are considering and adopting the same measure.via : baltimore sun
