If there s one thing Donald Trump loves, it s himself.
So, after the death of the staunchly conservative women s rights hater Phyllis Schlafly, Trump thought this would be the appropriate time to promote her book about his favorite subject himself, of course.No time like the present to use somebody s death to promote themselves, right?
Well, at least according to a man who could be classified narcopathic.Trump tweeted out: As a tribute to the late great Phillies Schlafly, I hope everyone can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
via TwitterNow, whether you like the Phillies or not, let s leave Philadelphia s beloved baseball team out of politics.Clearly, Trump relied on auto-correct spelling to try to spell Phyllis Schlafly s name correctly.
However, his effort failed miserably.Of course, Trump s campaign quickly caught on to this error and deleted the tweet then put out a new one with the proper spelling not too long after.As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2016Those over at the Trump campaign still seem to think it s okay to use the death of someone to promote the candidate.
However, this really should surprise no one.
It s not as if Trump holds himself to any form of standards of dignity and respect.Featured Photo by Ralph Freso/Getty Images, Twitter
