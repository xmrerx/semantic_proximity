Superstar Bette Midler has been having a high old time this election season taking shots at the GOP, and she continued the tradition today this time taking a shot at notoriously obstructionist GOPer Mitch McConnell.
Using her own medical appointment, The Divine Ms. M hit the senator hard via her Twitter account.Apparently, Midler had to go to the doctor for a routine colonoscopy on Thursday, and decided that it would be the perfect opportunity to point out the senator s obstruction of anything and everything President Barack Obama and the Democrats try to achieve.
She hilariously tweeted: I just got home from a colonoscopy.
Guess what they found?
Mitch McConnell!
That guy will obstruct anything!!

Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) May 18, 2016She s right, of course.
Now, it is highly unlikely that this wonderful woman would let that douchebag Sen. McConnell anywhere near any part of her body, including her colon, but this is hilarious just the same.
The GOP has obstructed President Obama and his administration at every turn since the moment he set foot inside the Oval Office, and they will continue to do so until he leaves, no doubt.
That behavior is pretty much par for the course at this point, so it s a good thing we have the likes of folks like Bette Midler to help us poke fun at the absurdity of it all.Keep up the good work, Ms. Midler.
