Infowars Alex Jones is offering a $1,000 reward for anyone who can get on TV with his Bill Clinton RAPE t-shirt clearly displayed for viewers to see.
If they can display a Bill Clinton Is A Rapist T-shirt and clearly proclaim, Bill Clinton is a racist they will get a $5,000 reward.
He plans to spend up to $100,000 to get this important message out to America.
Why is it important?
It s important because not only is Bill a sexual predator who has no business entering our White House ever again, Hillary has been acting as his enabler, threatening and intimidating victims of Bill s for years The mainstream media has declared war on Donald Trump, while providing cover fro Hillary and her multiple crimes and offenses.
We re in a war with a collective media and a radical leftist government.
Thank goodness for people like Alex Jones who aren t afraid to get into the trenches and pass along a message that the mainstream media will never expose.
