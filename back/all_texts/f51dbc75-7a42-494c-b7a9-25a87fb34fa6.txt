This is unseemly behavior by a First Lady and it s totally unconstitutional.Donald Trump s wife is throwing a hissy fit because she has allegedly been prevented from personally profiting off being First Lady because of a story alleging that she worked as an escort.Melania Trump filed a seeking $150 million from The Daily Mail, and her attorneys actually admitted that she had hoped to enrich herself and her family by turning the role of First Lady into a sales pitch for her shitty product lines.According to the lawsuit filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court by lawyer Charles Harder, Mail Online s conduct was extreme and outrageous in falsely making the scurrilous charge that the future First Lady of the United States worked as a prostitute.
Plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.These product categories would have included, among other things, apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care and fragrance.The [statements] also constitute defamation per se because they impugned on her fitness to perform her duties as First Lady of the United States.
Seriously.Melania Trump literally hoped she could disgrace the role of First Lady by using it to enrich herself.There s just one huge problem.As Raw Story points out, using a government position to personally profit is a violation of the Constitution.It s also sleazy and greedy.The First Lady is supposed to do things to help others, not herself.
The Trumps are already filthy rich and they get paid a salary every year as compensation for being in public office.
If the Trumps really only sought the presidency in some sort of scheme to enrich themselves, they should leave the office in disgrace before they are impeached or sentenced to prison like former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife, who also tried to use public office to personally profit.
Voters and taxpayers did not send Trump to the White House to work for himself and his bank account.
They sent him there to work for the American people.
And Melania Trump is turning out to be an embarrassment as First Lady just as much as her husband is an embarrassment as president.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images
