We called one ourself.
Two, actually.Deborah McCutchen is a professor at the University of Wisconsin who studies cognitive processes in reading and writing ability.
She looked at the letter.
She noted that the handful of small spelling errors followed the phonetic sounds of words pitcher instead of picture which would be common in the writing of a young child.
Then again, the letter also included a hyphen, which seemed sophisticated for a 9-year-old.Sheila Lowe, president of the American Handwriting Analysis Foundation, said she didn t see anything that would be inconsistent with a 9-year-old s writing, but she also clarified that she did not specialize in analyzing the writing of children.
She noted that the margins on the right side of the paper were very wide, which can indicate a feeling of concern about the future.#PickleTruther suddenly appeared on twitter as the lefty media furiously tried to prove that the letter was fake.We hope Dylan has a chance to meet President Trump and isn t bullied for his support of Trump like so many adults are.
He s adorable!
