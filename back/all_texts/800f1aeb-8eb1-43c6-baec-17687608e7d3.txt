Don t let Hillary s cheerleaders in the mainstream media convince you that she can beat Trump.
Trump has proven himself to be a formidable opponent and don t forget that Hillary was beaten by an amateur Jr.
Senator in 2008.
I ve consistently said throughout the analysis of this race that I would not want to run against Donald Trump because I think he s the most dangerous candidate.
Give me Ted Cruz, give me John Kasich, give me any of the vanquished they re traditional politicians, easy to beat.
And, Ted Cruz, in particular, way outside the mainstream, she said.
Donald Trump, when you look from what he said the other day about the gender bill and using the bathrooms, it proves that point because he knows how to appeal to not only Libertarians but to Independents who support that, too.
So he will be a very, very tough candidate to face in a general election.
I think it will be one of the closest elections we see since 2000. https://youtu.be/ZqtKc1aPiA4
