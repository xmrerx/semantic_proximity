The gay mafia has a new corporate Don.
This is the only article you will need to read about the sheer stupidity of left-wing agitators who are crowing about the new religious freedom law in Indiana.Yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook, himself a gay man, published an op-ed in The Washington Post with this ominous title: Pro-discrimination laws are dangerous.
Cook argues that religious freedom laws, like the one signed by Gov.
Mike Pence of Indiana last week are dangerous to gay people.A debatable point.
However, what is not debatable is this: laws that make homosexuality punishable by death are dangerous to gay people.That s why you might be surprised to learn that Cook s company, Apple, does business in four (4) countries that make homosexuality a capital crime.
Those countries are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, and Qatar.If you zip on over to this page, you can see the list of all of the countries where Apple does business.
Those four countries are on the list.We anxiously await CNN s Andrew Cuomo or ABC s George Stephanopoulos to ask Tim Cook to appear on air and explain this glaring inconsistency, which should be obvious even to the average MSNBC viewer.However, we all know that won t happen.Via: DownTrend
