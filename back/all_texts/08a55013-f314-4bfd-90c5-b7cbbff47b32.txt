Tea Party radio host and Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick has officially made the stupidest move yet in regards to bathroom rules in our schools.
Patrick declared that Texas was prepared to forego literally billions of dollars in federal education funding rather than allow transgender children to use the bathroom.
We will not be blackmailed by the president s 30 pieces of silver, Patrick ignorantly announced.
The we he refers to are rich elected Republicans that can afford to send their kids to private schools.
Not mentioned by any Republican is whether millions of Texas parents and children that are completely dependent on the public school system are also prepared to have their entire school system essentially shut down.This isn t just some minor budget readjustment and tightening of belts by teachers and school districts.
This is totally defunding the educations of 5.2 million students who rely on federal money to attend an already desperately underfunded public school system in Texas.As of now, the issue of school bathroom use is inevitably headed towards our court system.
The legal question is whether or not the federal government can continue using the Civil Rights Act to force schools to allow children to use the bathroom with which they feel comfortable.According to interpretation by the justice department, title 9 of the Civil Rights Act does allow for the federal government to prohibit discrimination based on gender in public schools that receive federal funding.If the courts find in favor of the federal government, which it is very likely they will, the president can then try to use the cutting off of federal funds in order to get state compliance on the law.The White House was asked about the Texas Lt.
Governor s comments.
Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, This does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to a statewide elected office.
