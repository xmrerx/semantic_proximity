on monday obama used his clemency powers to grant 78 pardons and 158 commutations according to the white house , which was the most individual acts of clemency in a single day by a president in us history.today obama doubled the amount of pardons he s given , but he still has pardoned less prisoners than any other modern president .
however , he s still used his powers of clemency over 1,000 times .
just a less powerful version : commutations .
including those that were done today , obama has now commuted the sentences of 1,176 people , including 395 life sentences .
most of the sentences he shortened were federal prison inmates with lengthy , mandatory-minimum drug sentences convicted during the war on drugs that s been happening over the last three decades .
now obama s completed more acts of clemency since any other president of the us since president truman.last year obama granted 95 pardons and commutations around the same time of year , which at the time was the largest single day use of his clemency power .
he s continued this pattern of granting holiday pardons , and has received criticism for it , with critics calling it a broken process .
according to obama , it s another step forward in upholding our fundamental ideals of justice and fairness .
besides the iranian nuclear deal , the last four rounds of pardons obama s granted it s been this time of year.however , there may possibly more pardons coming .
in august obama said by the time i leave office , the number of pardons that we grant will be roughly in line with what other presidents have done , with only 32 days left in obama s term , and 40 pardon s short of being in roughly in line it s quite possible we ll see more pardons before obama leaves.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images
