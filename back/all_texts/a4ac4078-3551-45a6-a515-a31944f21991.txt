Besides being a muslim terrorist sympathizer, it appears Bowe and B.O.
have something else in common Why is this guy (who is still considered active duty ) free to roam around while he awaits his trial?
Has everyone forgotten the lives of 6 brave Army members were lost searching for this idiot?
Additionally, gave 5 terrorists back in a deal to get this traitor back on U.S. soil, and we release him into the general public?
Who s got time for remorse?
