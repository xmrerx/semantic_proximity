london ( reuters ) - british foreign minister boris johnson said on friday it was appalling that russia had blocked a u.s.-drafted resolution to renew an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in syria .
it is appalling that the un joint investigative mechanism has been closed down , johnson said in a statement .
the united kingdom will not let the end of the joint investigative mechanism stop work with international partners to identify and hold accountable those responsible for using chemical weapons .
the vote at the united nations on thursday sparked a war of words between russia and the united states in the security council .
