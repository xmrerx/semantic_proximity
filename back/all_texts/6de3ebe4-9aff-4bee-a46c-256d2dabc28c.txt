God family, guns and country these are some of the most important things to the majority of Republicans, yet means very little to leftist Democrats.
Without God, we become the communist nation the Democrat party has been pushing us towards for decades God doesn t just go away because the Left wants Him to.
Unfortunately, this is what happens when a political party who elects godless presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton who sincerely believe that Government can replace God in the lives of American citizens.Salon Magazine has accused the Republican Party of being out of touch with post-Christian America, warning the GOP that if it doesn t renege on its alliance with Christianity, it will soon become irrelevant.Ted Cruz s failure to get the GOP nomination, Matthew Sheffield proclaims in Salon, is a perfect window into trends that will set the pace of American politics for decades to come: Americans are moving away from Christianity, including people most likely to vote Republican.
To back up his claims, Sheffield cites the 2014 Pew Research study finding that 23 percent of Americans say they re unaffiliated with any religious tradition, up from 20 percent just three years earlier.The trend away from religion, and Christianity in particular, Sheffield argues, is the real cause of Republicans woes and their failure to win the last two elections.
The likely reason why Republicans have declined in popularity among the non-religious is GOP s long habit of identifying itself as a Christian party, he states.
The later attempt to add in a Judeo- prefix has done little to stop the bleeding.
While the statistics showing a rise in the religiously unaffiliated are undoubtedly sobering to people of faith, Sheffield fails to mention that the very same Pew study showed that over 70 percent of Americans continue to identify as Christian.
That means that to an overwhelming majority of Americans, God matters.
