SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Wednesday his government will seek to pass legislation to legalize same-sex marriage by the end of the year after a majority of voters supported the move in a non-compulsory survey.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday 61.6 percent of voters cast their ballots in support of same-sex marriage.
A total of 38.4 percent were opposed.
The Australian people have tasked us to get this done.
This year, before Christmas - that must be our commitment, Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.
