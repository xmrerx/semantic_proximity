mexico city ( reuters ) - citigroup inc s local unit on thursday lowered its 2017 mexico gross domestic product ( gdp ) growth forecast to 1.9 percent from 2.0 due to the impact of a massive earthquake that leveled buildings in the capital , the country s economic heartland .
however , citibanamex ( c.n ) , in a client note , said this was a conservative estimate as they expected an improvement in economic activity at the end of the third quarter and in the fourth which would help counter the impact of tuesday s 7.1 magnitude tremor .
the quake , which killed at least 273 people , also toppled buildings in the states of puebla and morelos , sparking a desperate hunt for survivors under the rubble .
another massive tremor two weeks ago killed at least 100 people and wreaked havoc in southern mexico .
citibanamex said it expects a moderate fiscal stimulus from the government , and no changes in monetary policy .
that fiscal stimulus would likely come from two emergency funds , it added , noting that mexico was in much better shape to handle the impact of the quake than it was in 1985 , when a similarly massive tremor devastated the capital .
