In an interview with TIME, Donald Trump pussygrabber extraordinaire went after Stephen Colbert for referring to The Donald s mouth as a place where Russian dictator Vladimir Putin keeps his d*k warm.
You see a no-talent guy like Colbert.
There s nothing funny about what he says.
And what he says is filthy.
And you have kids watching.
And it only builds up my base.
It only helps me, people like him.
The guy was dying.
By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better, Trump said.
But his show was dying.
I ve done his show.
But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated.
It was high highest rating.
The highest rating he s ever had.
On Thursday, the late night host shot back at Trump, and it just had to be painful.
The president of the United States has personally come after me and my show.
And there s only one thing to say: Yay!
Colbert said during his monologue.
I won!
Mr. Trump, there s a lot you don t understand, but I never thought one of those things would be show business, Colbert said.
Don t you know I ve been trying for a year to get you to say my name?
Oh, please, don t make me trend on Twitter again!
Don t throw me in that #briarpatch!
Making jokes about you has been good for ratings.
It s almost as if the majority of Americans didn t want you to be President, Colbert informed The Orange One.
But you know who s got really bad ratings these days?
You do.
Terrible approval numbers.
I hear they re thinking about switching your time slot with Mike Pence.
Colbert s takedown of Trump was blistering, but the most painful part was when the comedian pointed out that the Trump show was not the highest-rated.
As for who was?
Let s just say his name rhymes with Neb Kush.
