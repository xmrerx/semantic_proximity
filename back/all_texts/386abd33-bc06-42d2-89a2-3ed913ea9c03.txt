Two polls have Hillary Clinton beating the wannabe-Fascist-in-Chief Donald Trump by fifteen points.
In RealClearPolitics compilation of all national polls, Clinton leads in the last sixteen taken, and has an average lead of 7 points.Today, the Clinton camp got some even better news: a recent Monmouth University poll has Clinton up a staggering thirteen points over Trump.
No longer is the 10+ polls outliers as this grueling election comes down to the wire.
Clinton leads with 50 percent to Donald Trump s 37 percent, while three percent remain undecided and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee, garners 7 percent.Just before the two major party conventions, the same poll had Clinton leading only by 2 points, 45-43 percent.The new Monmouth University shows almost total party unity, with Clinton nabbing 92 percent of the Democratic vote, up from 85 percent in July when she clinched the nomination.
Trump collects only 79 percent of the Republican vote, down from 81 percent in July.
Trump does, however, slightly have the lead with Independent voters, 32-30 percent.
That number, however, is down for Trump, who led with Independents by 9 points in mid-JulyAccording to Politico, the poll shows that Clinton s post-convention bounce may not be receding, but actually growing.When it comes to key swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and North Carolina, Politco says:Importantly, Clinton continues to maintain a lead in the swing states ten states that were decided by less than seven points in the 2012 election.
She holds a 42% to 34% edge over Trump in these states, which is similar to her 46% to 39% swing state lead last monthNot surprising, most whites in the new poll overwhelmingly favor Trump, with whites (men and women) without degrees favoring the Republican nominee +31 and +17 respectively over Clinton.However, one caveat is stunning the political world: white women with a college degree, who backed Romney 52-46 in 2012 over Obama, favor Clinton by over 30 points.
These educated women, according to the poll, is one of the biggest reasons Donald Trump is falling so far behind Clinton.Over 60 percent of respondents said Clinton has the temperament to be president while only 27 percent said Trump does, and over 60 percent of respondents are sick of hearing of Hillary Clinton s emails.Hillary Clinton is continuing her climb against the orange fascist, a telling, tangible showing that America is no longer flirting with a Trump presidency they re scared of a Trump presidency.And rightfully so.
Hoping WikiLeaks doesn t continue to help the Kremlin tilt the election, and that Democrats actually get out and vote, these poll numbers could become a reality in November, and America s serial sexist will finally be put in his place once and for all.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
