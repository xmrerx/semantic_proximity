being sent to russia for misbehavior may be just the incentive these lawless rapefugee need to begin assimilating with the european culture and following the laws they seem to have no regard for according to a russian news website , about 50 middle-eastern migrants , who had been expelled to russia from norway , began to harass girls at a club in murmansk .
a mob of russians then beat hell out of them .
they realised too late they are not in the european union .
police arrived and apparently did t really disapprove of what was happening .
they took 33 of the migrants to detention and 18 to the hospital.local law enforcement officially denies this incident took place , but there is lots of talk about it on social media .
