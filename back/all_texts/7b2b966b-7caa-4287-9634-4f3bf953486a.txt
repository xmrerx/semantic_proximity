WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate would take up before the end of this month a bill passed by the House of Representatives dealing with Puerto Ricoâ€™s debt.
McConnell, the top Republican Senate leader, was speaking to reporters.
Backers of the House-passed bill are hoping the Senate signs off on the legislation before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline on a $1.9 billion debt payment.
