berlin ( reuters ) - a german court on wednesday ordered the release of an army officer suspected of planning to carry out an attack on politicians and incriminate asylum seekers , saying there was not enough evidence to keep him in detention .
the officer , named only as franco a. , was arrested in april in a case that shocked germans and stirred a debate about the depth of right-wing radicalism in the country s military .
prosecutors suspected that franco a. , along with two accomplices , wanted to implicate refugees in their planned attack by posing under a false identity as an asylum seeker .
former president joachim gauck and justice minister heiko maas were on a list of possible targets prepared by the suspects , who wanted to make their attack look like the work of islamist militants , prosecutors had said .
however , the federal court of justice ruled on wednesday that there was not enough evidence that franco a. was preparing an attack to keep him in detention , even if there were some grounds for suspicion .
investigators must now make clear whether they have enough evidence to bring the officer to trial .
a suspected accomplice was freed in july pending trial , while the other suspect was released for lack of evidence .
the case had put pressure on chancellor angela merkel s government , with her close ally , defence minister ursula von der leyen , facing criticism for failing to deal with right-wing extremism in the army and also because she implied that most soldiers were right-wing radicals .
franco a. , who served with an army battalion stationed in france , had used a fake identity to register as a syrian refugee and moved into a shelter for migrants in bavaria even though he speaks no arabic .
the soldier had previously been detained in late january by austrian authorities on suspicion of having hidden an illegal gun in a bathroom at vienna s main airport .
