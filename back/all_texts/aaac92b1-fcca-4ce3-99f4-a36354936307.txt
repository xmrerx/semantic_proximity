Apparently the Black Lives Matter terror group hasn t managed to distract Florida voters from Crooked Hillary s untrustworthy record A new poll released from JMC Analytics in Florida (full pdf below) shows Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton 47% to 42%, and leading with Hispanic voters 49% to 36%.Some (particularly MSM) pundits will find these results quite shocking however, we do not.
We ve repeatedly pointed out that Latino voters in Florida are very familiar with strong Patrone male figures within their family.
Trump represents a very familiar cultural voice for them.This was abundantly evident in the primary race where Donald Trump won every county within Florida by exceptionally wide margins.You ll often hear the professional political punditry talk about the central (I-4) corridor and how the specific high population demographics influences elections.
Central Florida, and South Central Florida are the inland growing regions for much of the state s agricultural industry.
Look there and you can identify the Latino cultural support for Donald Trump.The coastal communities are diverse and representative of the larger U.S. electorate.
Hillary Clinton predictably polls well in the same area where Marco Rubio won out in the Republican primary.
However, Miami-Dade, while population strong, is less influential as the years have progressed and other coastal community populations have grown.Via: Conservative Treehouse
