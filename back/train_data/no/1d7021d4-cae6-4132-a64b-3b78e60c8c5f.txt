helsinki ( reuters ) - finnish police reprimanded a man for traveling in a car boot to hide his meeting with prime minister juha sipila during a government crisis last summer , saying this was breach of the traffic code .
a police statement did not name the man in the boot , but in effect indicated the traveler was state secretary samuli virtanen , who is also the deputy to foreign minister timo soini .
the meeting took place in june , a day after virtanen s co-ruling finns party had elected anti-immigration hardliners as its new leaders .
the government was close to collapse until a group of politicians , including virtanen and soini , in the following week walked out of the finns party and announced they would form a new group .
the finns party was thrown out of the government and the new blue reform group kept its cabinet seat .
virtanen has not commented on the case , but lawmaker tiina elovaara from blue reform said in a blog that virtanen climbed into the boot to keep the meeting secret at a critical moment .
he avoided media attention when the situation was most serious , and the risk of leakage about the parliamentarians transition was too big , elovaara said .
police said that the man had traveled a few tens of meters in the back of the car , failing to use a safety belt .
he had admitted the act to the police .
the road from the prime minister s residency has little traffic , and only the man was at risk of harm , the police said .
the given notification is considered as a sufficient sanction , inspector pekka seppala said .
he added that the police had been asked to investigate the case based on information in media reports .
