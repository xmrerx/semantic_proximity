New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie got into a heated discussion with MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace on Tuesday.
Wallace asked Christie about Chris Wray, the new director of the FBI.
Governor Christie told Wallace that he thought highly of Wray and that he was going to be an outstanding director of the FBI.
Christie told Wallace that Mueller made some mistakes, in that he didn t do a very good job of vetting his team for his Russian collusion investigation.
Christie then went on to tell her that Bob Mueller is a good man, but he shouldn t have allowed biased agents to be involved in the investigation.Wallace asked Christie, Were you ever around Donald Trump when he was ever warned about Russia or Russians?
Christie responded, No, not that I remember, no.
Wallace continued to press Christie, Were you ever around Donald Trump with Mike Flynn when they were talking about Russia or Russians?
Christie answered, Who are you?
Do you work for Mueller now?
I mean, you know, no.
