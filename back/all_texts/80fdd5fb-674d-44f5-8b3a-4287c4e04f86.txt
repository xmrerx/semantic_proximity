After GOP candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton wrapped up their appearance on MSNBC s Commander In Chief forum, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, had some very sexist words for Clinton:@HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time no smile and uncomfortable upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.
Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016The old she needs to smile more and she s too emotional spiel.
Of course, Trump was also defensive (even belittling a female veteran), but you heard nothing from Priebus about it.
No, in typical Republican form, the old, angry conservative man decided to attack the qualified woman running because that s just what they do.
Naturally, social media tore him to shreds for being a gross misogynist.
But it was Hillary Clinton s response, always laced with class and elegance, that took the cake: Actually, that s just what taking the office of President seriously looks like.

Thanks for showing the American people where your priorities lie, Republicans.
I wonder, will smiling more will keep our troops safe, reward our veterans, avoid war/conflict, and clean up the DOD budget?So the media and the GOP elite focus on smiling, coughing, a pillow on the chair during interviews, and defensive strategy.
No wonder Trump is a nominee for President of the United States.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
