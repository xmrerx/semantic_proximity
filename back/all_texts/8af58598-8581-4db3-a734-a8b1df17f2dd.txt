BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a senior member of the Social Democrats (SPD), on Tuesday lauded French President Emmanuel Macron s proposals to strengthen the European Union.
Emmanuel Macron today held a courageous, a passionate plea against nationalism and for Europe - a Europe which he wants to reform, strengthen and unite with our help, Gabriel said.
Right now, we need to seize this opportunity for Franco-German initiatives to make Europe more democratic, involve the citizens and make it fit for the future, Gabriel said.
Gabriel said a joint determination by EU member states was needed to resolve problems in Europe, adding: He can count on us.
