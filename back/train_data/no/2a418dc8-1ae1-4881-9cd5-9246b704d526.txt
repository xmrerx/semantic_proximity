bikers for trump leader chris cox spoke with fox s stuart varney regarding the shut down of ann coulter s speech at the university of california berkeley : the bikers for trump leader chris cox is now ready to take action on the university of california berkeley after conservative commentator ann coulter cancelled her speech on the campus thursday : we are certainly not looking for a fight we are here on the defense , not the offense cox met with berkeley police to discuss their plan of action going forward .
he made great points about the need for law and order over violence : from what i understand , any rumors that they ve been told to stand down will be squashed today .
they are not going to allow this disobedience , they are not going to allow the ski masks we ve been seeing around the country , so we still have a presence here at berkeley today .
we don t want to do anything that is going to give us a public relations black eye .
we ve stayed within the framework of the law and i intend that protesters will continue to stay within the framework of the law i didn t see an upside in coming to berkely and standing toe to toe with twinkle toes and butter cups
