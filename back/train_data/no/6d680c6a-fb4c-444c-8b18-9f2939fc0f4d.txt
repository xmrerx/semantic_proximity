washington ( reuters ) - the united states will send about 3,500 additional u.s. troops to afghanistan , u.s. officials said on wednesday , a figure broadly in line with expectations as the united states boosts support for the afghan military .
the disclosure by the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , comes as defense secretary jim mattis and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff marine general joseph dunford hold closed door briefings with members of congress about president donald trump s regional strategy .
the pentagon said it would not comment on additional troop numbers until mattis makes an announcement .
if confirmed , it would bring the total number of u.s. troops in afghanistan to about 14,500 .
after a months-long review of his afghanistan policy , trump committed the united states last week to an open-ended conflict in the country and promised a stepped-up campaign against taliban insurgents .
last week mattis said he had signed orders to send additional troops to afghanistan but did not specify the size of the force , saying he first needed to brief congress .
u.s. officials have for months told reuters that trump had given mattis the authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to afghanistan .
the u.s. presence in afghanistan peaked at more than 100,000 troops in 2011 , when washington was under domestic political pressure to draw down the costly operation .
some u.s. officials have told reuters they questioned the benefit of sending more troops to afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide , much less create stability and security .
to date , more than 2,300 americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded in afghanistan .
