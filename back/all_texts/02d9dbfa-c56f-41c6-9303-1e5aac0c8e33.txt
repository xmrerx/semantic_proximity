While appearing on the CNN presidential town hall, Donald Trump likely made the most asinine statement ever uttered.
After being asked about Israel, Trump proceeds to tell Wolf Blitzer that President Obama has been the worst thing to ever happen to Israel.
He said: President Obama the worst president that Israel has ever probably one of the worst things that s ever happened to Israel.
Yeah, that damn Obama ensuring diplomacy and trying to disarm a nuclear Iran all while still making sure Israel gets $8.6 million per day from US taxpayers.
Totally awful for Israel.
(sense the sarcasm)Donald Trump clearly has no clue what he s talking about, because if he did, those words would have never been uttered out of his mouth.You know what would be terrible for Israel, the entire Middle East and the world?
Something that could very likely render a third world war because of leadership that doesn t know how to careful maneuver foreign diplomacy and policy?
A Republican presidency.
In particular, a Trump presidency.Trump is all talk, and this talk is just outright wrong.// < !
