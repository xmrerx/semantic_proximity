bogota ( reuters ) - colombia s leftist eln rebels said on sunday they are willing to extend a ceasefire set to expire next month if there is sufficient progress at peace talks with the government .
the national liberation army ( eln ) and the government have been in public peace talks in quito for 10 months , after a long exploratory phase of negotiations , in a bid to end more than 53 years of war .
the group s first-ever ceasefire began in october and is set to expire jan. 9 .
it is being supervised by the catholic church and the united nations .
we are willing to agree a new ceasefire once we have jointly evaluated at the negotiating table the progress , confidence and results of the current one , the group said in an open letter to the u.n. posted on the eln s twitter account .
the eln added that it would also assess the government s willingness to overcome hurdles at the talks .
the 2,000-strong eln , which has regularly bombed oil infrastructure and taken hostages , has continued kidnapping despite the ceasefire .
an indigenous leader in choco province died in october after being detained by the group .
