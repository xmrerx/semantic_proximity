One of the immediate benefits of The Panama Papers is that we now have a clear picture of how corrupt corporations have been both actively causing the death of millions of people all around the world.In a video created by the International Coalition of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), they explain how the law firm Mossack Fonseca has been enabling corporations to sell fuel and weapons being used to kill tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to continue doing business despite an international ban imposed by the United States, the UK and several other countries.ICIJ also highlights how the law firm decided it wasn t their business to report one of their clients to the police for being a child rapist that later sold his victims into sex slavery:One of the ringleaders was a client of Mossack Fonseca.
When the firm discovered their client was a pedophile, they decided that they were not legally obliged to report his off shore business activities to the authorities.Another galling example shown in the video is how one company, with the help of Mossack Fonseca, deprived the nation of Uganda of over $400 million in taxes.
In a country as poor as Uganda, this lack of money leads directly to the death of women and children who cannot receive proper healthcare.
Remember that when you hear a Republican refuse to investigate the law firm in the coming weeks.Mossack Fonseca is also involved with laundering money for the international drug trade, which is where the millions of dead people mentioned in the title come from.Watch the video below and try to imagine what kind of people can be so callous towards their fellow man: Featured image via screen capture
