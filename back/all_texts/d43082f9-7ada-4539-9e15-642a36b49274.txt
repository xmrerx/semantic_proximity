There are seldom people in life that you can honestly say are solidly good people, but Mark Zuckerberg is one of those few that could fall into that category.
Not because of his creation of Facebook, which in and of itself is extraordinary, but because of what he says and does.
His actions, throughout his career, have spoken louder than words.From his $100 million donation to Newark, New Jersey schools, to giving $25 million in the fight against Ebola, to most recently saying this in a Facebook post to his new daughter:Now, in yet another Facebook post, Zuckerberg offered his New Years resolution which included reading two books a month, creating a Jarvis from Iron Man artificial butler for his own personal use, and exploring the future advancement of technology.// < !

My challenges in Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday, January 3, 2016Your basic range of typical resolutions to that of utter genius, but great resolutions nonetheless.It was in a comment, though, to his post that Zuckerberg showed how fiercely feminist he is.
When a grandmother commented on his post and said: I keep telling my grand daughters to Date the nerd in school, he may turn out to be a Mark Zuckerberg!
Thanks for FB, I ve reconnected with family and many old friends and classmates.

via FacebookDamn right!
Don t tell your daughters or teach your daughters to date the nerds, tell them to BE the life-changing geniuses!And while what this woman was saying was all done with a good heart, and good intentions, Zuckerberg s quick shift in thought process, and ability to point out that women are just as capable as men, is pretty damn awesome.Well done, Mark!
