Americans need to know that gun control is not just an issue leftist legislators are pushing.
Educators and school administrators are making it clear that even the suggestion or thought of a gun by students, regardless of age, is evil and will be punished.
When this story first came out in the news, we thought it had to be fake.
Once we realized it was a real story and that a 2nd grader had actually been suspended for chewing a pop-tart into the shape of a gun, we applauded his father for taking the matter to court.
We assumed any reasonable judge would rule against the irresponsible parties involved in their reckless decision to suspend this 7 year old boy, and that the boy s suspension would be reversed.
Were we ever wrong The suspension of second grader who chewed his breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun was upheld by a circuit court judge last week.Joshua Welch was suspended from Anne Arundel County s Park Elementary in March 2013 after chewing his pastry into the shape of a gun and [pretending] to fire it.
The student s father, B.J.
Welch, took the matter to court in hopes of having the suspension reversed and expunged from his son s record.But WJZ 13 reports that an Anne Arundel County circuit judge upheld the suspension, ruling that Joshua s actions were disruptive.
Anne Arundel County Schools reacted to the ruling by releasing a statement which said, We have believed from the outset that the actions of the school staff were not only appropriate and consistent, but in the best interests of all students.
Welch family attorney Robin Ficker lamented the ruling and pointed out there was no violence, no real weapon, no ammunition.
But the suspension will now be on [Joshua s] record in school every time he goes into a new grade.
