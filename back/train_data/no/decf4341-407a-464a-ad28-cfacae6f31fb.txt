washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. air force contract to start replacing the aging fleet of jstars spy and battle management planes is expected to be awarded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 , air force secretary deborah james said on wednesday .
james told a u.s. house of representatives armed services committee hearing it was regrettable it was taking longer than expected to award the engineering , manufacturing and development contract .
last year the pentagon â€™ s chief arms buyer approved the next step in a multibillion-dollar competition to replace 16 joint surveillance target attack radar system aircraft , or jstars , which have flown over 100,000 combat hours and are approaching the end of their service life .
