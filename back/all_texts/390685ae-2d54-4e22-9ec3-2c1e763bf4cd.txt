PRESIDENT TRUMPIn the aftermath of another terror attack in London, our President tweeted support and a statement regarding the travel ban.
NBC refused to retweet a message President Trump had tweeted from the Drudge Report saying there are fears this could be terror:How is it that fearing it was terror is at all confirming it was terror?
NBC tweeted this out:PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED OUT THIS AWESOME MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF LONDON: We Need the Travel Ban as an Extra Level of Safety President TrumpThe Trump administration asked the Supreme Court late Thursday to let the revised travel ban take effect.The Supreme Court should rule on this request as early as this week.The administration filed two emergency applications with the nine Court justices seeking to block two lower court rulings that blocked President Trump s executive order.In the filing, the Justice Department argued that the appeals court in Richmond, Va. made several mistakes in ruling against Trump s travel order.Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the ban is lawful.The order barred entry for people from six Muslim majority nations, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. implements stricter visa screenings.The 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals called the national security concerns an after-the-fact justification for a policy that was intended to bar Muslims from this country.
