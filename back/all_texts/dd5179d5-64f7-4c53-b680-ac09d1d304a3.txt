Donald Trump threw a petty hissy fit in the White House.Prior to Sean Spicer scolding the media in the White House press room for accurately reporting on the crowd size at the inauguration, Donald Trump apparently threw a massive temper tantrum.According to White House sources who spoke to the Washington Post, Trump became visibly enraged after watching some of the Women s March on Washington the day after his inauguration because he realized that the march was way bigger than the meager crowd who showed up to for his swearing-in ceremony.
Trump turned on the television to see a jarring juxtaposition massive demonstrations around the globe protesting his day-old presidency and footage of the sparser crowd at his inauguration, with large patches of white empty space on the Mall, the Post reported.
As his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was still unpacking boxes in his spacious new West Wing office, Trump grew increasingly and visibly enraged.
Trump was adamant, aides said.
Over the objections of his aides and advisers who urged him to focus on policy and the broader goals of his presidency the new president issued a decree: He wanted a fiery public response, and he wanted it to come from his press secretary.So now we know why Trump lied his ass off during a visit to CIA Headquarters about his inauguration crowd size and why Trump mouthpiece Sean Spicer was sent out to whine about press coverage of the inauguration.Trump completely lost his shit because he watched television expecting to hear nothing but nice things being said about him and instead heard the news that the Women s March was more popular.Seriously.It didn t even take a day for Trump to overtake George W. Bush as America s most embarrassing president.
And considering Trump s agenda, it won t take him long to become the nation s most disastrous president either.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images
