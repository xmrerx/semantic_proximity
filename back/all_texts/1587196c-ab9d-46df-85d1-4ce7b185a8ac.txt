Trump s supporters have become increasingly violent at Trump campaign events.
That violence is usually directed towards protestors and people of color.
Trump has been actively encouraging this violence, though he still claims that he is not.People have noted that many of the people stuck in traffic are angry at the protestors.
Twitter, as per usual, is doing a great job of pointing out the problem with some people s priorities.Drivers angry bcuz of inconvenience.
People protest bcuz #NeverTrump has threatened torture, mass expulsion &violence.

#stoptrump Puente Arizona (@PuenteAZ) March 19, 2016Protests were expected to take place at the Trump rally.
That s why Sheriff Joe Arpaio was called in to police the event.
Here I m gonna be kinda wearing two hats in charge of the security there in the town and also participating, I would imagine, with Trump in the rally, so it makes it interesting, Arpaio said in an interview with Politico, adding that it is going to be a lot of fun taking care of business there.
