pnhom penh ( reuters ) - cambodian prime minister hun sen on saturday called on lawmakers from the main opposition party to defect ahead of a court ruling on whether to dissolve it , saying they could be banned from politics for five years if they left it too late .
the government s move to ban the cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) follows the arrest of its leader , kem sokha , on treason charges .
he rejects the charges as politically motivated ahead of next year s general election .
hun sen , the world s longest serving prime minister , has held power for more than 32 years .
western countries have called for the release of kem sokha and for an end to attempts to dissolve the cnrp .
hun sen said in a message to cnrp parliamentarians and local councillors , he knew not all had been involved in kem sokha s alleged treason and they should take the chance to switch to his ruling cambodian people s party ( cpp ) .
i want to give you this opportunity to continue in your job , he said .
it will not only be that the party is dissolved and then the matter is finished .
maybe more than 100 people will be banned from politics for five years .
he said such a ban was likely to include all the cnrp s steering committee - meaning most of its members of parliament , around half of whom have fled cambodia to escape arrest .
no cnrp officials were immediately available for comment .
cambodia s supreme court is in theory independent of the government in ruling on the interior ministry s request for the cnrp to be banned , but hun sen has said it is a fact that the party will be dissolved .
cambodia s parliament has already passed a law to share out elected positions to other parties if the cnrp is dissolved .
most of the seats in parliament will go to minor parties while local councils , known as communes , will be taken over by the ruling party .
