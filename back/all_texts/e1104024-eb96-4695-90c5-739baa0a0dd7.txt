THE PLOT THICKENS ISIS is claiming responsibility via Twitter for the Russian plane crash that killed 224 people.
The pilot of the Russian plane had reported some difficulty before the crash so the claim by ISIS is curious at best.
They also released supposed video of the plane crashing (see below).
Please pray for the loved ones of the 224 people who died in this horrible crash.
ISIS has claimed responsibility for destroying a Russian passenger jet in response to Vladimir Putin s decision to bomb Jihadi targets in Syria.
The aircraft, which had 200 adult passengers, 17 children and seven crew crashed less than 25 minutes after it took off from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
The Irish-owned aircraft was leased by a Russian airline.
It crashed in the Hassana area, south of Arish.
Security forces discovered the crash wreckage in a remote mountainous area in a region containing many ISIS-affiliated terrorists.
