If there s anyone who has clearly had enough of Donald Trump s ridiculous bullying shenanigans, it s Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
Time after time she has just absolutely pummeled his rhetoric and isn t intimidated at all by his name-calling and hyperbolic antics.
If she s not battling him on Facebook, she s battling him on Twitter.
If she s not facing off with him on social media, she nailing him in a speech.
She wants to make damn sure that pompous man gets nowhere near the Oval Office.Going after him yet again, right before her endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president, Warren spoke at the American Constitution Society s national convention.
She hit him over the head with the fact that he s a racist bully who is trying to intimidate a judge out of doing his job just because he s of Mexican heritage, albeit born in Indiana.
Trump doesn t want him hearing his Trump University case for the very racist reason that Judge Curiel is Latino.One of Warren s best lines from her speech came when she said: Judge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life.
Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself.
BOOM!
Wow.
So, so true.Trump cannot be president.
He doesn t have any of the necessary experience required to be leader of the free world.
He wants to be president not for the nation, but for himself, to say that he won.
He s a blowhard who deserves to be condemned, and you can bet your ass Elizabeth Warren will keeping hitting him, and hitting him hard.And what scares a fragile, insecure man the most?
A strong woman who WILL NOT back down.Watch her speech slamming Trump, time and time again, here:Featured image via video screen capture
