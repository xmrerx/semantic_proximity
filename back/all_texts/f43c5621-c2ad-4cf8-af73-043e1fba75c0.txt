The war of words between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren just reached an epic new height.
On Saturday, during the Democrats of Massachusetts state convention, Warren did the best thing that you can do to a bully like Trump gave him a taste of his own medicine.Warren has blasted Trump multiple times over the past few months, yet nothing she has said compares to the no-holds barred verbal punches she threw out during her speech at the convention.Speaking about the giant predatory scheme that was Trump University, Warren likened the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to a sleazy car salesman: It was like a used car dealership except that s not fair to used car dealerships, Warren told the audience.
His playbook said to look for people with problems; they make good targets.
Trump even encouraged his sales force to go after elderly people who were trying to build a little financial security, Warren continued.
Now, Trump University failed and that s no surprise.
Think Trump Airlines, Trump Steaks, Trump Magazines, Trump Vodka, Trump Casinos, Trump Mortgage, Trump Games, Trump Travel, Trump Ice, Trump Network, Trump Radio, and Trump New Media Company.
These were ordinary folks who were targeted because they had problems and Trump saw they were vulnerable and he could make a buck.
Here s a man who builds a business to profit off other peoples pain.
He wants to be Commander-in-Chief, but he s only qualified to be Fraudster-in-Chief.
Warren s evisceration of Trump is both thorough and rooted in factual evidence.
The speech is a glorious indictment of Trump s fraudulent schemes and should serve as a reminder of just how terrible a Trump administration would be for the United States.
Trump s campaign, much like his business schemes, is nothing more the exploitation of those who are desperate enough to believe that a has been reality TV star has anything to offer in the way of being a true leader.You can watch the speech below.Featured image via video screenshot
