desperation has set in and planned parenthood is resorting to messy stunts that try and make anti-abortion groups look bad .
i just don t think these ghouls realize that no matter what they do , this is evil and wrong planned parenthood claims on several of its websites that the organization s web operations have been attacked by extremists , but this so-called hacking has all the hallmarks of an orchestrated public relations stunt.numerous people on twitter pointed to evidence suggesting that this so-called hack wasn t a hack at all : a review of the source code of the main page that appears at plannedparenthood.org shows that as of 9:30 a.m. today , the page is listed as a campaign and uses a specific template named site down tempalte ( the typo is theirs ) .
the same page then directs visitors to the facebook page of planned parenthood action fund , the political fundraising arm of the nation s largest abortion provider.and that s where planned parenthood s hacking facade begins to crumble .
on the splash page declaring that the organization was hacked , visitors are asked why do you stand with planned parenthood and invited to share their stories on a separate page.and wouldn t you know it , that page functions perfectly.what next planned parenthood , you gon na stage a fake bombing or arson at one of your abortion clinics as a fundraising hoax ?
i m sure your pals at the splc could supply a list of likely suspects to frame.it s just a shame these ghouls can t cry racism or homophobia .
hey , maybe they should expand their services to include sex change operations or race reassignments .
i bet bruce jenner and rachel dolezal would be onboard with that.via : blur brain
