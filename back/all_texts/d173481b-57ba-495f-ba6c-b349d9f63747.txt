Climate march s are happening all over America.
Many of the same groups like Antifa who turned out to burn, riot and loot in Washington DC during Trump s inauguration and who ve been turning up in Berkeley, CA to shut down speech rights of conservatives came to show their disdain for America.
A transgender man was caught lighting a small American flag on fire and holding it up like a small child at show-and-tell to share with his anti-American friends.
He got a big surprise however, when a pro-Trump, pro-American biker caught a glimpse of the burning American flag.Watch video below:https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/858700002654388224An Iowa City Press-Citizen photographer captured the incident in which Matt Uhrin used a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze before taking the flag from protesters.
The demonstrators said they were protesting against what they call the Republican agenda, which includes positions on gay rights, civil rights and the controversial Bakken oil pipeline.Here is the video showing Matt Uhrin, an American hero, taking on a whole crowd of losers to defend our flag.
It s hard not to shed a tear when you see how bravely he defended the honor of our US flag against this large group of degenerates who have no idea our flag stands for.Happening now: a confrontation on the ped mall as people burn an American flag as protest.
