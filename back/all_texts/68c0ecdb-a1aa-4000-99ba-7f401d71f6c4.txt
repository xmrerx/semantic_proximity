Alleged president Donald Trump doesn t want to be judged by his first 100 days in office even though it became a tradition after Franklin D. Roosevelt s first few months after taking the oath.
But really, we can t blame the former reality show star for wanting to forgo the tradition considering how horrifying Trump s nearly 100 days in office has been.
As for his accomplishments, we re not seeing any.
And in comparison to former President Barack Obama, Trump looks like an amateur.Early this morning Trump tweeted, No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017We re not sure what Trump did in South Carolina.
Perhaps he s referring to Georgia where Democrat Jon Ossoff outperformed every Republican candidate in the deep red district but he just didn t pay the 50 percent mark to avoid a runoff.
Or maybe Trump is talking about Neil Gorsuch.
It s hard to tell.Trump s 100th day may begin with a government shutdown if Congress fails to approve a new spending deal.Obama passed 11 laws during his first 100 days in office.
So far, Trump has focused on reversing vital things that his predecessor has done for this country, including Internet privacy and health care, among others.
The bigot-in-chief failed twice to pass a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Trump is inundated with scandals, including his administration s possible collusion with a hostile foreign government to interfere in our election process.The Internet reacted to Trump s tweet:Trump says the first 100 days is a "ridiculous standard"Signed legislation compared.
Obama did everything on the left in the first 50 days pic.twitter.com/hDzw6GkkCl Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) April 21, 2017I think people know I'm no Trump fan but I searched signed legislation for major legislation to positively highlight Trump.
It doesn't exist Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) April 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump Let's look at some of Trump's accomplishments during his first 100 days: "Misplaced" an entire naval strike group pic.twitter.com/XN3CycDITJ Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) April 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump On ISIS: "They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.
"That was 83 days ago.
Alex Zalben (@azalben) April 21, 2017Instead of working, Trump has been golfing and taking weekend vacays.
@realDonaldTrump Look how many days you went golfing !
More than Obama, Bush, or Clinton in the first 100 days!
Big league accomplishment !
Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) April 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump You accomplished?
You're charging US citizens thousands of dollars each time you use your own golf cart!
& that's just the smaller charges ?
?

As you're about to fail the 100 day test, you begin attacking the "unfairness" of the test.
So predictable.
Trita Parsi (@tparsi) April 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump Wait, what did he do to South Carolina?
pic.twitter.com/1ToyO135VI RPBP (@rpbp) April 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump But you've not accomplished anything, 45.
Hilarious you say this while currently under FBI investigation for treason.
We haven't forgot.
Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) April 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump I mean, you have rolled back many Obama era regulations.
But I'm pretty sure thats more like reversing progress, not a great accomplishment.
Aaron Shive (@aaronshhh) April 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump Where's the report on Russian hacking that you promised you would deliver in your first 100 days?
We're waiting.

(@RVAwonk) April 21, 2017Unless Trump considers his playdate with Kid Rock, Ted Nugent and Sarah Palin on Thursday an accomplishment, then he s done nothing to move our country forward.
Or embarrassing us in front of the world by disparaging our allies.
That, too, is not an accomplishment.
Words mean things.But the fact Trump hasn t blown anything up today is sort of an accomplishment for an angry 70-year-old Twitter addict.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
