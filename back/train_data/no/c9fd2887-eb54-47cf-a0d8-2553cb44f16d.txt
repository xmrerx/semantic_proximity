budapest ( reuters ) - hungary wants the european union to speed up integration of the western balkans and for nato to include those countries , foreign minister peter szijjarto said on wednesday .
speeding up the accession process is a guarantee of security , szijjarto said at a news conference also attended by a dozen officials from central european and western balkan countries .
an unstable and tension-riddled western balkans is a serious risk to all of europe .
he said the eu should launch accession talks with albania and macedonia no later than the first quarter of 2018 .
the eu should also offer bosnia and kosovo realistic and attainable integration goals and timetables and at nato s december meeting of foreign ministers the military organization should make a decision to start macedonia s membership talks and activate a membership action plan for bosnia .
he said one important risk of an unstable south-eastern european region was its inability to withstand a new wave of migration .
if a new wave of migration were to come , only a stable and strong west balkans can stop that , szijjarto said .
at the moment the eu has no strategy regarding the west balkans .
other foreign ministers and diplomatic leaders echoed that sentiment .
our nation is geographically surrounded by eu member states but we have been on the periphery of the political attention of the eu , macedonian foreign minister nikola dimitrov said .
