donald trump s education department is pathetic now that betsy devos is in control , and this proves it.devos first week as secretary of education has been terrible to say the least.first , she was blocked from entering a public school by protesters and ran away .
then she posted a tweet jokingly asking where the pencils are , which drew a sharp rebuke from teachers , who did not find her joke funny because they usually have to buy their own school supplies for their classrooms.and so , the department of education under devos rule is off to a rough start , and it got downright embarrassing on sunday as americans watched in horror as the education department proceeded to post twitter messages containing misspelled words.seriously .
this is the f * cking department of education we are talking about .
spelling should be in their wheelhouse .
but because of trump and devos , that skill has apparently been lost.in celebration of black history month , the department of education decided to recognize and quote w.e.b .
du bois .
it did not go well.education must not simply teach work it must teach life .
w.e.b .

this bodes well for an already faltering system .
