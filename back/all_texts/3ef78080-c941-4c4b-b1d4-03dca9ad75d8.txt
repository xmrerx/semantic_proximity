Right-wing radio s high priestess of hate, Laura Ingraham, has a few questions about military spending.
Namely, she wants to know if taxpayers are still footing the bill for transgender people to go and cut their private parts to death.
On the Friday episode of Ingraham s radio show, she went on an offensive rant about how the U.S. military deals with medical care for those who may be transgender, and she wants some answers.
What do you think about all that social experimentation they re doing in the military?
They still going to pay for those for sex change surgeries in the military with taxpayer dollars?
Aren t they are they paying for those now, Drew?
The operations for the people to go and cut their private parts to death and whatever they do?
Wasn t that a push, they want the taxpayer dollars to pay for those sex change surgeries?
What do you think old Mad Dog [Gen. James Mattis] is going to think about that?
We ve got to cut, but not that way.
Ingraham is known for her bigotry, particularly her racist attacks on President Obama.
She also gave a nod to white supremacists when she gave a Nazi salute after her speech at the Republican National Convention.
Not surprisingly, this has earned her the respect of Donald Trump, who is now considering Ingraham as a contender for White House Press Secretary.As our friends at Winning Democrats pointed out when it was announced that Trump was considering her to be his mouthpiece, Ingraham is also known for her anti-women stances: Ingraham not only opposes a woman s right to choose, she attacked Anita Hill and worked to smear her for accusing Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her.
Ingraham also called for defunding the Violence Against Women Act which helps fight domestic violence.
