anyone who would look at these charts and still vote for hillary or bernie is basically saying , i really don t care about my future , or the future of my children or grandchildren .
here is a bit more in-depth data as it relates to a few of the charts above : food stamp increase nears record high despite low unemployment rate under barack obama : despite the unemployment rate being at an eight-year low ( 4.9 percent as of january 2016 ) , the number of people on food stamps remains near an all-time high which was 47,636,000 in 2013.why the disparity in the numbers ?
well , the unemployment rate does not take into account people who are not in , or have dropped out of , the workforce altogether.the bureau of labor statistics reported in january of this year that approximately 94 million americans are not participating in the workforce.but the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) has been hovering around 46 million participants since 2011 .
the current figure , as of february 2016 , shows average snap participation at 45.8 million americans receiving food stamps in 2015.soaring health care premiums under obamacare : obamacare premium costs will soar 20.3 percent on average in 2016 instead of the 7.5 percent increase claimed by federal officials , according to an analysis by the daily caller news foundation.the discrepancy is because the government excluded price data for three of the four obamacare health insurance plans when the officials issued their recent forecast claiming enrollees would face only a 7.5 percent average rate increase in 2016.when data for all four plans are included , premium costs will actually rise on average 20.3 percent next year .
the 2015 obamacare price hike was 20.3 percent.our national debt is at $ 19.25 trillion !
when obama took office it was at $ 10.26 trillion .
obama has almost doubled our national debt since taking office only 7 years ago !
