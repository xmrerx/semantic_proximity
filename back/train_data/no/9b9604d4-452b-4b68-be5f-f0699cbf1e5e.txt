if you re like us , you either made a donation , knocked on doors , or called voters on behalf of a republican candidate in the 2014 election .
maybe you did all three things .
is the candidate you worked so hard to get elected or re-elected on this list ?
we were very disappointed to see the name of the candidate we supported for us rep in mi on the list of yea s. we also know we won t be working so hard to help him with his re-election bid next time around .
only one representative in the entire state of mi , justin amash ( r-mi ) actually stood up against the establishment and said no , we re not gon na take it anymore !
please take the time to look through this list and contact your us representative or us senator .
let them know the next time they look to you for support of their re-election , that you don t help people who sell out our nation.it s worth noting , that marco rubio didn t even bother to vote on one of the most critical spending and national security bills in our nation s history !
if he can t be bothered to vote on such a critical bill , how can he be bothered with representing our nation in the most powerful position in our government ?
conservative presidential candidate , senator ted cruz ( r-tx ) voted against this insane bill .
he criticized the legislation in a statement after the vote , saying it effectively forfeits our massive republican victories of 2014 and cements obama s priorities for nearly the full remainder of his term .
