native americans continue to battle poverty , joblessness and low incomes .
about 28.4 percent of american indians and alaska ( 1 in every 3 ) natives nearly twice the national rate lived in poverty in 2010 .
their unemployment hovers around 49 percent , according to the bureau of indian affairs most recent labor force report in 2005.a michigan native american tribe plans soon to offer cash to help k-12 schools , public and private and universities , and municipalities replace indian mascots.a recent state tally found 35 k-12 schools in michigan had native american-themed mascots , including the indians , the warriors , the redskins , the chiefs , the big reds , the redskins , the chieftains and the braves.not every michigan native american tribe is in agreement with the notawaseppi huron band of the potawatomi : central michigan university has been using the chippewas as their team logo for decades .
their nickname is used with consent of the nearby saginaw chippewa indian tribe , who have a positive relationship with the university .
the university was placed on the ncaa s list of schools with hostile or abusive nicknames in august 2005 , but appealed the decision , with the support of the saginaw chippewa indian tribe .
on september 2 , 2005 the university announced that their appeal of the decision had been upheld.the notawaseppi huron band of the potawatomi says they d be the first tribe in the united states to help offset the costs of replacing the mascots.that replacement process can be expensive , a tribal spokeswoman said .
for instance , a school may have to change everything from gym floors to athletic uniforms to band equipment to official letterhead to its website.in 2013 , the michigan department of civil rights unsuccessfully called for the department of education to prohibit the use of indian mascots , names , slogans , chants and imagery .
