it makes you wonder if they have training programs abroad in how to buy convenience stores in the us and rip off the dumb ( infidel ) americans ! more than a dozen retail store operators in and around baltimore have been charged in connection to a huge food stamp and wire fraud scheme.the indictments allege the retailers received more than $ 16 million in federal payments for transactions in which they did not provide any food , a fraud scheme commonly known as food stamp trafficking .
retailers must apply to and be approved by the usda s food and nutrition service to participate in supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , formerly known as the food stamp program , which helps low income families afford nutritious foods.in maryland , the program provides eligible individuals with an electronic benefit transfer ( ebt ) card , which operates like a debit card .
authorized retailers use a terminal that checks the card information and deducts the cash value of the purchase from the snap balance.snap reimbursements are paid to retailers through electronic funds transfers .
retailers bill the government in return for providing approved food items to customers.the indictments allege that the defendants illegally exchanged ebt benefits for cash , instead .
to avoid detection , they debited the funds from the card in multiple transactions over a period of hours or days , or called a different store where the transaction was processed manually , the department of justice says.as a result these transactions , they allegedly obtained more than $ 16,482,270 in ebt deposits for transactions in which food sales never occurred or were substantially inflated and split the proceeds with food stamp recipients .
the food stamp program is intended to put food on the tables of needy recipients , not to put money in the pockets of greedy criminals , said u.s. attorney rod j. rosenstein .
honest storeowners work hard to earn a profit by actually selling food , and food producers and distributors also benefit .
