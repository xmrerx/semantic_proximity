lima ( reuters ) - the peruvian attorney general s office accused former president alejandro toledo on friday of taking bribes from brazilian construction firm camargo correa sa [ pmorrc.ul ] in exchange for a lucrative highway contract during his 2001-2006 term .
an unnamed state s witness had helped uncover evidence that showed some $ 3.98 million in payments camargo made to toledo through offshore bank accounts controlled by one of toledo s associates , the attorney general s office said in an emailed statement .
camargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
in lima , toledo s attorney , heriberto benitez , said toledo was innocent of the accusations .
i spoke with him yesterday , he said : i didn t take money from anyone , benitez said to reuters in a phone interview .
toledo is already wanted in peru in connection with allegations that he took $ 20 million in bribes from odebrecht [ odbes.ul ] , another privately owned brazilian builder , for help winning a contract for building a different section of the same highway .
peruvian authorities are seeking toledo s extradition from the united states .
his current whereabouts is unclear , but authorities said in february that he was in california , near his alma mater stanford university .
following a judge s order in february that he should be held in pre-trial detention , toledo said he would not return to peru .
he has repeatedly described the probe as political persecution .
last year odebrecht admitted to paying millions of dollars in bribes in peru to secure lucrative government contracts over a decade-long period , spurring a far-reaching investigation to determine which officials received them .
odebrecht and camargo were at the center of brazil s biggest-ever graft inquiry , known as operation car wash .
