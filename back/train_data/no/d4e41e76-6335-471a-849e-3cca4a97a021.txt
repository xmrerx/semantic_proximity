london ( reuters ) - british prime minister theresa may will travel to brussels on monday to meet with the european union s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier and head of the eu commission jean-claude juncker , may s office said on sunday .
may will travel with brexit minister david davis for the meetings which her office said were a long-planned part of the prime minister s build up to a european council summit on thursday .
the summit is seen as a critical point in britain s stalling efforts to negotiate an exit deal with the eu after brussels said last week the latest round of negotiations had ended in deadlock over money .
eu leaders could hand may an olive branch at the summit by launching their own internal preparations for a transition to a new relationship with britain .
may spoke to german chancellor angela merkel earlier on sunday and the two agreed the need for continued constructive progress in the exit talks , an earlier statement from may s office said .
