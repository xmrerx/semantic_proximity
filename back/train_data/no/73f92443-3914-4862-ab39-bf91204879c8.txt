aden ( reuters ) - the saudi-led military coalition fighting against yemen s houthi movement will allow the resumption of international commercial flights to the country , a yemeni government minister said , easing its nationwide blockade .
the alliance said on monday it had closed all air , land and sea ports in yemen to stem the alleged flow of arms to the houthis from iran after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired towards riyadh , which it blamed on tehran .
flights by national carrier yemenia to the pro-saudi government-held cities of aden and seiyun would resume on sunday , yemeni transport minister mourad al-halimi said .
the united nations had warned that a total blockade could cause a famine that could kill millions in yemen , where 2-1/2 years of war has killed at least 10,000 people and unleashed famine and disease in the already impoverished country .
the european commissioner for humanitarian aid called on the saudi-led coalition to allow aid to reach the yemeni population .
the eu urges the coalition to ensure the immediate resumption of the u.n. s flights and activities in the ports of hodeida and saleef and the opening of land borders for humanitarian relief and basic commercial commodities , christos stylianides said on saturday .
the government-held southern yemeni port of aden was reopened on wednesday , but ports in houthi-held areas are still shut .
the coalition reopened the al wadea border crossing linking saudi arabia with territory in eastern yemen on thursday .
