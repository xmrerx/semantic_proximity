The media has been talking all day about Trump and the Republican Party s scam of a tax bill; as well as the sheer obsequiousness of Trump s cabinet, and then members of Congress, after their tax scam was all but passed.
But the media isn t quite saying what Trump wants.
They ve been doing analysis and discussion all day long rather than praising it for the grand achievement Trump believes it is.
The GOP has increasingly sounded exactly like Trump when it comes to media coverage, and coverage of the tax scam is no different.
Coverage of Trump in general hasn t changed.Today, Lindsey Graham went after the media for portraying Trump as a kook, and unfit for office (they wouldn t be doing their job if they weren t telling the truth, though).
Graham said: You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the guy as some kind of kook; not fit to be president.
Jake Tapper notes that he himself has never labeled Trump that way.
But then he points out something rather odd about Graham s opinion.
Take a look at the short video clip below:Lindsey Graham today: I m concerned by the media s attempt to label Trump as a kook or not fit to be President.Lindsey Graham in 2016: I think he s a kook.
I think he s crazy.
I think he s unfit for office.

He parroted himself.
In 2016, he used the exact words to describe Trump that he said the media is using today.
