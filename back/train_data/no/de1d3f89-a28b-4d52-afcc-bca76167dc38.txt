new york ( reuters ) - vermont senator bernie sanders has erased secretary of state hillary clinton ’ s wide lead for the democratic presidential nomination since the start of year , putting the two in a dead heat nationally , according to a reuters/ipsos poll .
clinton leads sanders 48 percent to 45 percent among democratic voters , according to the poll of 512 americans , conducted feb. 2-5 following the iowa caucus .
the poll has a credibility interval of 5 percentage points .
democrats had been supporting clinton by more than a 2-to-1 margin at the beginning of the year .
sanders has narrowed that lead considerably over the past several weeks .
clinton beat sanders narrowly in the iowa caucuses , the nation ’ s first nomination contest ahead of the november election , but is expected to lose to him in new hampshire .
the two rivals clashed on thursday night in their first one-on-one debate , reflecting the tightness of the race .
there is still a wide gap between the two in name recognition nationally .
nearly a quarter of democrats and two-fifths of independents say they are still not that familiar with sanders .
in comparison , clinton has almost total name recognition among voters .
on the republican side , donald trump continued to lead the field with 40 percent support .
his level of support among republicans was relatively unchanged following his second-place finish in the iowa caucus .
senator ted cruz of texas followed with 16 percent and senator marco rubio of florida came in third with 13 percent .
