bangkok ( reuters ) - a thai court sentenced a 62-year-old man to 27 years in prison on wednesday for planting a bomb at a bangkok hospital that wounded 21 people .
the explosion hit the phramongkutklao hospital in the thai capital , bangkok , in may on the third anniversary of a 2014 military coup .
the hospital is popular with soldiers and their families and retired military officers .
police arrested watana pumret , a retired government employee , after the blast and said he had confessed to the bombing because he despises the military .
from the evidence we believe the accused committed the offence ... the accused confessed to it , a judge said .
courts in thailand often do not identify the names of judges , with the exception of some high-profile legal cases .
watana was seen crying after the verdict .
he hugged his wife and refused to answer reporters questions , according to a reuters reporter at the court .
reuters was unable to contact watana s lawyer after the verdict .
thailand s military launched a coup in may 2014 after months of street protests that took a toll on southeast asia s second-biggest economy .
the military promised to unite the politically divided country and restore stability but it has been accused by critics of not wanting to relinquish power .
the military government has promised to hold a general election in november 2018 to return thailand to democracy but senior government figures have said more time was needed to complete laws related to the vote .
the government has also cited security concerns as a reason for not lifting a ban on politics that has been in place since 2014 , despite increasing pressure from groups of all political stripes to lift the ban .
