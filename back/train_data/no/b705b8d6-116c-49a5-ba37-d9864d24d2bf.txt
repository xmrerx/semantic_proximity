abuja ( reuters ) - the united states has formally agreed to sell 12 super tucano a-29 planes and weapons to nigeria , the west african country s air force said , confirming the resurrection of a deal frozen by the obama administration over rights concerns .
former u.s. president barack obama delayed the sale in one of his last decisions in office after the nigerian air force bombed a refugee camp in january .
but his successor donald trump decided to press on with the transaction to support nigeria s efforts to fight boko haram militants and to boost u.s. defense jobs , sources told reuters in april .
the u.s. ambassador to nigeria presented letters of offer and acceptance to nigeria s air force earlier on wednesday , the air force said in a statement .
it said the u.s. state department had approved the sale and final agreements would be signed and necessary payments made before feb. 20 .
there was no immediate statement from the u.s. embassy or from authorities in washington .
u.s. government and nigerian air force officials would meet in early january to discuss the early delivery of the aircraft once payment had been made , the nigerian air force said .
the sale of the 12 aircraft , with weapons and services , is worth $ 593 million , and includes thousands of bombs and rockets .
the propeller-driven plane with reconnaissance , surveillance and attack capabilities , is made by brazil s embraer .
a second production line is in florida , in a partnership between embraer and privately held sierra nevada corp of sparks , nevada .
the super tucano costs more than $ 10 million each and the price can go much higher depending on the configuration .
it is powered by a pratt & whitney canada pt 6 engine .
