Yesterday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway sparked national outcry when she used a Fox & Friends interview as a pathetic commercial for Trump s daughter Ivanka, after Nordstrom became the latest retailer to drop Ivanka s brand from its stores.
It was not only an incredibly awkward interview to watch as Conway shamelessly told viewers to buy Ivanka s products, but it was also highly unethical, causing Conway to get blasted for violating ethical guidelines.Earlier today, CNN reported that Conway had to apologize to Trump for the controversy, as federal employees are not supposed to endorse products or promote the goods of friends or family (even though Trump seems to do this quite often).
White House press secretary Sean Spicer was even forced to respond to the backlash, stating that Conway had been counseled for her behavior.Now that Conway has apologized to Trump, she s apparently back in his graces and can continue spewing her alternative facts (aka blatant lies).
Conway tweeted that Trump still supports her and her shameless lack of ethics:But not all is well just yet.
According to CNN, Trump is not happy with Spicer s comments about having counseled Conway on the matter.
Apparently, Trump said he hated what Spicer said.This is just the latest in the breakdown of Trump s chaotic, volatile team.
Every day, there is a new f**k up or controversy to react to as Trump s team proves to be the most incompetent, dishonest, disorganized and troubled team we ve ever seen operate the White House.
There have already been rumors that Trump is looking to replace Spicer and Conway continues to be shunned by the media over her pathological lies, which won t work in Trump s favor.
It seems like Trump s biggest supporters, Conway and Spicer, are now doing more harm than good and things are definitely imploding faster than they can handle.Featured image via Alex Wong and Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
