berlin ( reuters ) - german justice minister heiko maas said there was no place for anti-semitism in germany after demonstrators angered by u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel burned israeli flags in berlin .
on sunday , about 2,500 people demonstrated in berlin against trump s decision and one israeli flag was burned , police said , adding that investigations into 11 people had been launched , with one of those related to the flag burning .
on friday , hundreds of people gathered outside the u.s. embassy in the german capital for day of rage protests .
police said later on twitter that they had detained 10 people during the protest and that 12 criminal charges had been brought - including for burning israeli flags .
maas told bild newspaper s monday edition : any kind of anti-semitism is an attack on everyone .
anti-semitism must never be allowed to have a place ( in society ) again .
anti-semitism remains a very sensitive issue in germany more than 70 years after the end of the nazi-era holocaust , in which 6 million jews were killed .
germany regards itself as one of israel s closest allies .
german foreign minister sigmar gabriel told bild that while criticism of trump s decision was understandable , people had no right or reason to burn the israeli flag , stir up hatred against jews or question israel s right to exist .
he said whoever did that was taking a stand not only against israel but also against the german constitution and germany would not tolerate that .
gabriel said germany only permitted peaceful demonstrations and would not allow conflicts in which people were prepared to use violence to be brought to germany from other countries .
