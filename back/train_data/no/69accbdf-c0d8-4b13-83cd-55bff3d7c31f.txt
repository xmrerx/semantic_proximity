we know that ss disability is full of fraud in the first place so why the heck does the ssa rely on people to self report overpayments ?
just another big government idiotic program wasting our tax dollars unreal ! we just reported on the cut in social security payments to 77 % and it s no wonder the way they handle our money.the social security administration ( ssa ) overpaid individuals a total of $ 371.5 million in disability benefits from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal 2013 , according to a government accountability office ( gao ) report.these overpayments are cause for concern , as the social security s disability insurance trust fund is expected to go broke by 2016 , according to ssa s 2015 annual report .
during a time of growing concern about the solvency of the di trust fund , it is important for ssa to take every opportunity to help improve the financial status of the program , the gao said .
the report examined how these concurrent federal employees compensation act ( feca ) payments affect disability insurance ( di ) overpayments.the gao found that ssa did not detect concurrent feca payments for about 1,040 individuals during at least one month from july 1 , 2011 , through june 30 , 2014.to test ssa s internal controls , gao randomly selected 20 beneficiaries for review .
in all 20 cases , ssa s controls failed to detect and prevent overpayments .
in seven of the cases , ssa did not detect overpayments for more than a decade , and each of these individuals received $ 100,000 in overpaid benefits.one of these seven individuals received feca benefits in the 1980s and was approved for disability benefits 14 years later in 1994 .
the gao found that this individual received $ 200,000 in overpayments for more than 20 years.the ssa s internal controls rely on beneficiaries to self-report overpayments.read more : wfb
