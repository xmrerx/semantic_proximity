paris ( reuters ) - the military campaign against islamic state in syria should be completed in february following the end of fighting against the militant group in iraq , french president emmanuel macron said .
on december 9 , iraqi prime minister ( haider al- ) abadi announced the end of the war and the victory over daesh , and i think that by mid- to late february we will have won the war in syria , macron said in a broadcast interview , using the arab acronym for islamic state .
france would now push for peace talks involving all parties in the six-year-old syrian conflict , including president bashar al-assad , macron told france 2 televisions , promising initiatives early next year .
he did not say how any french proposals would relate to existing negotiations being brokered by the united nations .
despite being a leading backer of the syrian opposition , france has sought a more pragmatic approach to the syrian conflict since the arrival of president emmanuel macron , saying that the departure of al-assad was not a pre-condition for talks .
assad s government has been backed by russia and iran .
president vladimir putin last week announced a significant scaling back of russian forces in syria , saying their mission was largely complete .
