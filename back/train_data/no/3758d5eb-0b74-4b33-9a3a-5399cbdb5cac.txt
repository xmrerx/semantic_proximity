donald trump will likely go down in history ( hopefully way down ) as the presidential candidate who embraced twitter as his main campaign tool .
while other candidates simply tweet , trump uses the social media platform as his main source of messaging and branding.of course , that often gets the candidate in hot water , especially with his habit of retweeting things from white supremacists , but because we know trump spends so much time on twitter , it s the perfect format for trolling the presumed gop presidential nominee , and that s exactly what twitter users have been doing for the last several days , under the hashtag , # 1776trump , which imagines trump as a founding father ( shudder ) .
it s also completely hilarious !
jefferson wrote a stupid declaration , they should have asked me i have a great brain .

# 1776trump sharon houston ( @ sharon_houston ) july 6 , 2016one of the reasons this hashtag is going completely nuts is that it is difficult to imagine trump during the days of the founders , or for that matter , during any other time in history .
trump is a candidate made from tv and promoted by social media .
his limited vocabulary is a plus when he has to post in 140 characters or less .
his grandiosity and shameless self-promotions are almost expected .
we ve seen racist and nationalistic presidential candidates before .
we ve seen rich ones too , but we ve never seen one like donald trump and hopefully , we ll never see one again.featured image via marc piscotty at getty images
