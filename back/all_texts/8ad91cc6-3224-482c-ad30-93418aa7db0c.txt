DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika said the closure of I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport could last longer than 24 hours amid an eruption of Mount Agung.
We don t know how long it will be closed for, Pastika told reporters, referring to the Bali airport.
Sure, it s been closed for 24 hours until tomorrow, but that doesn t rule out the possibility the (closure) could be extended, he said.
At least 5,000 foreign and 15,000-20,000 domestic tourists pass through the airport each day, according to Pastika.
Ngurah Rai is Bali s main international gateway and a hub for tourists traveling to Indonesian islands further east.
