Millions of Americans did not vote for Donald Trump on Tuesday night and are protesting his election.
And Trump can only whine about it.It didn t take long for Trump to act unpresidential on Twitter following his election victory.Once he got his phone back from his aides, Trump took to his Twitter account to whine, bitch, and moan about the anti-Trump protest movement.Trump called the protests professional as if they are getting paid to protest and then accused the media of inciting the movement.Just had a very open and successful presidential election.
Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting.
Very unfair!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016Yeah, Trump literally has not learned to keep his mouth shut and you can see the hypocrisy in this one since he s the one who incited his supporters to threaten bloody violence with guns if he had lost the election to Hillary Clinton.
He definitely would not be calling that unfair.
Needless to say, Twitter users found Trump s tweet amusing and proceeded to humiliate him in response.
@realDonaldTrump how is this hard to understand when you lost the popular vote?
many people don t like you!
James Grebey (@jgrebes) November 11, 2016@realDonaldTrump wait we can get paid to protest you?
Enrico (@The700Level) November 11, 2016@The700Level @KittyCRodriguez @realDonaldTrump I want in on this too.
Need to save up money before Trump takes my health care away.
Andrew Whatever (@xvszero) November 11, 2016@realDonaldTrump Try listening to the protesters.
You might learn a lot about the nation you are about to lead.

Not a professional.
Did it because I believed in it.
Heard about it through friends.

You re answerable to the people now.

@realDonaldTrump We are Americans.
We are allowed to protest.
It s not unfair , it s in the Constitution.

@realDonaldTrump Protesting is a constitutional right.
Also, now that you are President-elect, your lies are government propaganda.
Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) November 11, 2016@laurenduca He got exactly what he wanted & still he s pitying himself not to mention responding to protest like a dictator.
Lord love us.
Rachel Vorona Cote (@RVoronaCote) November 11, 2016@realDonaldTrump Have you prepared a speech yet on how to tell your supporters that your wall on the border is never going to be happen?
#NotMyPresident (@BestOfRaps) November 11, 2016@realDonaldTrump THIS was unfair pic.twitter.com/qg2EpVMj99 Tony Paul (@TonyPaul1984) November 11, 2016@jonahkeri every time I calm down for a minute, this clown reminds me of how dangerous he is.
Greg Chernack (@GChernack) November 11, 2016If Hillary Clinton had won, does anyone think Trump would be calling this a very open and successful election?
Please.
@realDonaldTrump Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) November 11, 2016Donald Trump spent a year and a half using offensive hateful divisive language casting anyone one who isn t a white male conservative an enemy of America.
People are NOT going to forget that and they certainly are not going to forgive and bow down to kiss Trump s ass.
His entire campaign was unfair to the American people and now he is reaping what he sowed.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
