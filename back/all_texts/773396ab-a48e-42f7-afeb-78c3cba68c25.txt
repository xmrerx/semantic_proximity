Donald Trump is either really desperate to make it sound like everyone loves him or he s totally delusional.Because ever since inauguration day, millions of Americans have been participating in protests against him and his disastrous administration.The Women s March of Washington DC not only dwarfed Trump s inauguration crowd by a landslide, it was joined by people around the globe.And the protests haven t stopped.They continued outside the White House as Trump watched Finding Dory while worldwide chaos continued due to his Muslim ban.
It s been two weeks since Trump took office and he has already been protested and hated by more people than any other president in history.But Trump took to Twitter on Friday morning to claim that all the protesters are just thugs who have been paid to protest him, suggesting that the protesters really love him and are only protesting to make some money.Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017And protesters responded by laughing at him..@realDonaldTrump I was in the march on D.C. , where national guard helped us; can you let me know where to get my check?
;-) pic.twitter.com/HUJH8A4f93 Dr. Craig Malkin (@DrCraigMalkin) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump yes, yes I know; it s all part of a George Soros conspiracy that no protestor seems aware of.
Dr. Craig Malkin (@DrCraigMalkin) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump I protested peacefully this week.
I did it because I despise your policies.
Didn t know I could get paid.
Will do it again.
Matt Haig (@matthaig1) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump I ve said this before, but please let me know how we re getting paid, because so far I ve been doing this pro bono.
Alex Zalben (@azalben) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump also, everyone I know is protesting you for free, spending large chunks of time to stop you and your anarchist agenda.
Alex Zalben (@azalben) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump it s almost as if we just throwing it out there don t like you?
Alex Zalben (@azalben) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump What qualifications to professional anarchists need and what s the pay like?
Neil Claxton (@MintRoyale) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump great point!
Let s talk votes and the millions more who voted against you.
Just about 3M more than the votes for you ??

@realDonaldTrump You re letting the actions of a handful overshadow the legitimate concerns of the 65 million people who voted for Hillary?

@realDonaldTrump There were several hundred thousand if not a million people in your back yard for #WomensMarch.Zero arrests.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 3, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump So to make your case by handpicking a few bad actors out of the millions of protesters nationwide is disingenuous.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump where did you get info they are being paid?
Evan Rosenfeld (@Evan_Rosenfeld) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump so which of these tweets was a lie?

@realDonaldTrump Hard to pay all the people at the Women s March.
You remember, the one that had better attendance than your inauguration.
Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) February 3, 2017Donald Trump is a thug who brought a band of thugs to the White House with him to terrorize the American people and destroy our nation.
He is an embarrassment who thinks protests and dissent should be silenced.And that s why we should turn up the heat by protesting him more.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
