the speech he gave to a sold out crowd on saturday is epic .
we often listen to it to get fired up about bringing down the commies currently trying to destroy america .
it s truly epic !
the speech that breitbart is best known for is his cpac speech : the complaint , filed friday in federal court in california , says that leopold filed a freedom of information act request with the fbi for all records related to andrew breitbart on aug. 7 , 2012 , a few months after breitbart died at age 43.according to the suit , the fbi responded to the request on sept. 4 , but said that the bureau only searched it main file records , claiming that no records were located.the complaint says that leopold appealed the fbi s response but was denied by the u.s. department of justice office of information in 2013 .
in its appeal decision , oip claimed that the fbi is not required to perform cross-reference searches unless the requester provides information sufficient to enable the fbi to determine with certainty that any cross-references it locates are identifiable to the subject of [ the ] request , including , for example , the dates and locations of contacts between the subject of the request and the fbi , the subject s social security number , or other such information , the suit reads.however , buzzfeed and leopold contend in the complaint , nothing in the foia statute requires a requester to provide this information before a cross-reference search must be conducted .
as fbi and oip are certainly aware , andrew breitbart was a well-known public figure and is easily identifiable by the fbi in conducting a cross-reference search , the suit reads .
as the fbi and oip are also aware , cross-reference searches frequently turn up records not located in main file searches .
