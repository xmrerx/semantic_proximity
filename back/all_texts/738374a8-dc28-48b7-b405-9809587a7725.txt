The new progressive American dream: An Undocumented, Unafraid, Unapologetic, Queer, Unashamed illegal immigrant, or lawbreaker who practices defending legal cases in our US courtrooms..She s in the United State illegally.She helped cause the immigration crisis happening right now that some are calling an invasion.And now, she s a lawyer.Prerna Lal, a radical leftist and self-described Undocumented, Unafraid, Unapologetic, Queer, Unashamed illegal immigrant who once talked about killing, roasting and eating white invaders bragged on her Twitter account that she s now officially an attorney here in the United States.Lal proves that in Obama s America, not only are there are no legal consequences for being a loud and proud illegal immigrant.
Lal seems completely unconcerned about hopping back and forth across our borders at will.
In another post on her Twitter page, Lal talks about going back home to her native Fiji.Lal also is one of the people responsible for the current massive influx of children and asulym seekers overwhelming our nation s borders.As reported on Breitbart News in September 2013, Ms. Lal is a respected, published immigration reform activist.
She s a prominent Dreamer activist one of the young illegal aliens brought to the United States by their parents who are leading the fight for comprehensive immigration reform.Lal is one of the co-founders of the DreamActivist.org site that Breitbart News has reported gave illegal immigrants a lesson in how to lie about their immigration status.
That tactic has commonplace now.
