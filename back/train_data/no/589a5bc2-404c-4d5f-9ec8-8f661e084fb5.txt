copenhagen ( reuters ) - an unidentified arm found by divers in the water near copenhagen could belong to swedish journalist kim wall who died after taking a submarine ride with the vessel s danish inventor in august , danish police said on tuesday .
the arm was found near the route that had been investigated in connection with the submarine case , the police said in a statement .
the limb would be examined by coroners on wednesday .
we have not yet determined if this is a right or left arm or who the arm belongs to .
but we are working from a perspective that it stems from the submarine case , police spokesman jens moller jensen said .
wall , a freelance journalist who was researching a story on submarine owner peter madsen , went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre ( 56-foot ) submarine in august .
on aug. 23 , police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in copenhagen as that of wall .
in october , police said they had recovered her head and legs .
madsen admitted to dismembering wall on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea , but he still denies murdering her and a charge of sexual assault without intercourse .
the trial has been set to take place in copenhagen next march .
