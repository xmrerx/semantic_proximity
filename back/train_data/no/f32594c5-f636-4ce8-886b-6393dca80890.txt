paris ( reuters ) - hundreds of pro-palestinian activists on saturday staged a protest in paris against israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu s planned visit to france on sunday .
protestors carried palestinian flags and photos of french president emmanuel macron marked accomplice for hosting netanyahu following the u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel .
netanyahu , who has welcomed trump s move , will meet with macron on sunday ahead of a meeting with european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
france said on friday the united states had sidelined itself in the middle east by recognizing jerusalem as israel s capital .
foreign minister jean-yves le drian said on french tv that the u.s. move went against international law .
trump says he has a project .
let him present it , so that this intervention can be wiped out by the restart of the peace process , he said .
macron and turkey s president tayyip erdogan will work together to try to persuade the united states to reconsider the decision , a turkish presidential source said on saturday .
france has been a supporter of the palestinian cause .
in 2014 , the french national assembly passed a non-binding motion calling on the government to recognize palestine , but the government has not officially done so .
