three young men from north africa were arrested on saturday in the western german city of dortmund for stoning two transgender women.according to a report on friday on television station sat1.nrw , the men attacked yasmine und elisa , two transgender women , near the city s main train station .
within seconds we were tossed around and they took stones from a gravel bed on the corner and threw them at us , said elisa.a police car appeared at the train station as the stoning attack unfolded and arrested the men.the german media as a general rule do not disclose the last names of victims to protect their privacy .
the three men are between 16 and 18 years-old and are known to the authorities from theft and assault arrests.dortmund police official kim-ben freigang said the suspects told the police that such persons must be stoned .
yasmine installed a security camera at the residence where she lives with elisa after the attacks .
that was barbaric what they did .
they are barbarians , yasmine said.she added that she could not believe that such an act of shamelessness occurred .
