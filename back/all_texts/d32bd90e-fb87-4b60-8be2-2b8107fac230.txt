LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May is outraged by North Korea s firing of a missile that flew over northern Japan on Friday and Britain will keep pressing China to increase the pressure on the state, her spokesman said.
North Korea fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean, South Korean and Japanese officials said, deepening tension after Pyongyang s recent test of its most powerful nuclear bomb.
The prime minister is outraged by North Korea s continued reckless provocation and she strongly condemns the regime s illegal tests, the spokesman said.
Our key focus now is continuing to press China to keep up the pressure on North Korea to change course.
