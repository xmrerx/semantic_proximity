a close aide to bill clinton said he arranged for $ 50 million in payments for the former president , part of a complicated mingling of lucrative business deals and charity work of the clinton foundation mapped out in a memo released by wikileaks on wednesday.the report was written by doug band , who has transitioned from his job as a clinton aide to a partner in teneo consulting , a company whose client roster now includes some of the biggest companies in the world .
along the way , band wrote , he also pushed his clients and contacts to donate millions of dollars to the clinton foundation , and to help win business deals for bill clinton.band wrote the memo in november 2011 to john podesta , now chairman of the hillary clinton campaign , and sent copies to other key clinton aides , apparently to explain and justify his work in the face of criticism from others in the clinton orbit notably chelsea clinton.wikileaks has been releasing thousands of hacked emails from podesta s account in recent weeks , revealing the rivalries and controversies roiling inside the clinton family network as hillary clinton prepared to run for president.in the memo , band depicts himself as the indispensable linchpin of the clinton family s finances even as he acknowledges that the arrangement is unusual : we appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles , band wrote.a spokesman for the clinton campaign declined to comment ; the campaign has refused to confirm whether the emails are authentic .
band did not immediately respond to a request for comment.in the november 2011 memo , band lays out how he founded teneo five months earlier with declan kelly , one of hillary clinton s top fundraisers during her 2008 presidential campaign .
when clinton became secretary of state , kelly was named an envoy to northern ireland , holding the post even as he continued to represent several clients .
rightly or wrongly , band said , because other fundraisers couldn t deliver , he and kelly pushed their clients to donate to the foundation ; he also lined up speaking and consulting deals for bill clinton .
in some cases , it worked the other way , with teneo winning consulting contracts from foundation donors.one example , he said , was laureate international university , the for-profit international school that donated more than $ 1.4 million to the clinton foundation and was paying bill clinton $ 3.5 million a year to serve as honorary chancellor .
the company paid clinton more than $ 17 million before the relationship ended last year , as hillary clinton was launching her presidential bid.read more : detroit news
