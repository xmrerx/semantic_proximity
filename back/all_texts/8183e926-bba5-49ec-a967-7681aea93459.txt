In 2014, he was charged with disorderly conduct, after he set up a nihilist-anarchist puppet show in Times Square.
He also was involved in an art display where he set up a series of mutilated marionettes on a train platform.In keeping with the theme of his anti-Trump show, he was previously arrested for protesting at an art event in Miami, while carrying a sex toy in his pocket.
He reportedly said he was making a demonstration against the super wealthy.Trump has become notorious in a very short time for encouraging political violence by his supporters.
He has made public statements expressing the idea that protesters should be beat up, and said he would be looking into providing legal aid to a Trump supporter who punched a Black Lives Matter in the face.Featured image via Instagram
