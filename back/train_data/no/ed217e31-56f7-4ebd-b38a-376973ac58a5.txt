( reuters ) - detroit would sell its first general obligation bonds since exiting bankruptcy in december 2014 under a proposal by mayor mike duggan ’ s administration to refund up to $ 660 million of outstanding bonds .
the city council on tuesday sent the plan to refund up to $ 275 million of unlimited tax go bonds sold in 2014 and up to $ 385 million of limited tax go bonds sold in 2010 and 2012 to its budget , finance and audit committee for consideration .
the outstanding bonds were issued through the michigan finance authority and backed by the city ’ s share of distributable state aid payments .
john naglick , detroit ’ s finance director , said detroit expects to capture lower interest rates in the bond refundings to save money for the budget and to lower property tax rates supporting the bonds .
“ if it wasn ’ t for this move to record low rates , we wouldn ’ t do this , ” he said .
ten and 30-year yields on municipal market data ’ s benchmark triple-a scale are at or near all-time lows , driven by big investor demand for debt sold by states , cities , schools and other municipal issuers .
detroit was able to shed about $ 7 billion of its $ 18 billion of debt and obligations in the biggest-ever u.s. municipal bankruptcy .
in its first post-bankruptcy public debt offering last august , the city restructured $ 245 million of variable-rate revenue bonds backed by city income taxes into a fixed-rate mode at a hefty spread over mmd ’ s scale .
if the go bond refundings are approved by the city council committee on wednesday , the measures would head for a full-council vote on june 21 .
naglick said the issuance also needs approval from the detroit financial review commission , the city ’ s post-bankruptcy oversight board , which meets on june 27 .
