guatemala city ( reuters ) - former guatemalan dictator efrain rios montt will face a second trial on friday for genocide , a lawyer for victims said , reviving a case against the strongman accused of ordering massacres of maya indians during a long civil war .
rios montt , who ruled guatemala in 1982 and 1983 after a military coup , was convicted of genocide four years ago along with another military officer but the ruling was overturned .
a supreme court tribunal will hear the case , edgar p rez , a lawyer for the relatives of victims who have led a years long campaign against rios montt , said on wednesday .
the 91-year-old retired general was diagnosed with senile dementia in 2015 .
he will be represented in court by two lawyers and will not make a personal appearance .
the lawyers were not immediately available for comment .
the new trial will revisit the earlier accusations that rios montt ordered massacres leading to deaths of at least 1,771 ixil mayan indians during his 17-month rule .
rios montt maintains his innocence , saying junior officers acted without his knowledge .
guatemala s 1960-1996 civil war led to the deaths of more than 200,000 people and was the bloodiest among the cold war conflicts that tore through latin america when u.s.-backed military government battled leftist governments and rebels .
