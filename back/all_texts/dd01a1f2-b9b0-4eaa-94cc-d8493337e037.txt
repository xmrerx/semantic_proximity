BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called on the United States on Wednesday to present its proposal to revive the Middle East peace process as a matter of priority.
Before a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at NATO, Johnson said the U.S. decision to move its embassy to Israel makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward, he said.
That should happen as a matter of priority, he said.
