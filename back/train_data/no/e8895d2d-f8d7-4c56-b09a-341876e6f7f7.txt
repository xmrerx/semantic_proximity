peshawar , pakistan ( reuters ) - the militant pakistani taliban group said it carried out an attack on sunday that killed five people in the tribal areas bordering afghanistan .
tehreek-e-taliban pakistan ( ttp ) spokesman mohammad khurassani said the militants planted an improvised explosive device to target security personnel in the bajaur agency area that is part of the federally administered tribal areas ( fata ) .
the blast struck a vehicle in the mamund area of bajaur , killing four security personnel and an official from the civilian administration , local government sources said .
bajaur is one of the pashtun tribal regions near the afghan border .
security in the region has improved in recent years after the pakistani military mounted offensives there against the al qaeda-linked pakistani taliban , which is considered the country s biggest security threat .
but militants continue to stage attacks in fata , which remains off-bounds for foreigners and is considered one of the most volatile parts of the nuclear-armed nation of 208 million people .
