Congressman Paul Ryan received enough support from the House Freedom Caucus to secure his nomination for Speaker of the House as of Oct. 23, 2015.
Congressman Louis Gohmert told One America News that Ryan may have gained some of the support because Senator Jim DeMint, now head of the Heritage Foundation, and former Speaker of the House and Congressman Newt Gingrich pressured Freedom Caucus members to cave and endorse Ryan for Speaker.
