There s an age-old question that has been haunting the American people for several decades now is Donald Trump s hair real?
And if it is real, how does it do what is does?
And if it isn t real, where does he get it from?Well, folks, we may finally have our answer.
It looks as though a Donald Trump wig farm has been spotted along the coastline of Troms , Norway.
And of course he would outsource his hair to another country what a hypocrite.Just kidding!
The hair is actually just a form of bunch grass, but the resemblance to whatever that is on top of Trump s head is remarkably uncanny.There s currently a ridiculously hilarious video making the rounds from VGTV out of Norway that has been asking this hair-raising question.
They, of course, explain what it actually is you are seeing, but the video itself it pretty damn gut-busting as they super-impose video and images of Trump defending himself over and over, telling people his hair is, in fact, real.
Although, with as much lying as the Republican front-runner has been doing lately, who knows, really?Let s just say this is a nice break in the monotony of the insane that we ve had to endure for the past few months.Enjoy!Watch the silly video explaining it all here:Featured image via video screen capture Scott Olson/Getty Images
