Ted Cruz paid dearly for insulting New York values on Tuesday night, and Stephen Colbert couldn t resist rubbing the loss in Cruz s smug face.During the Late Show on Wednesday night, the audience applauded after Colbert told Cruz to Suck it.
The clearest message coming out of New York last night was: Suck it, Ted Cruz, Colbert quipped.
Suck our New York values!
Indeed, Ted Cruz had hoped to win New York even though he had been trashing the state throughout his campaign for not having the same values as him.And New York voters delivered a crushing defeat to the Texas Senator by voting overwhelmingly for Donald Trump.In fact, New York hated Cruz so much that Ben Carson received more votes than he did even though he hasn t been in the race for a month, a fact that Colbert found amusing.
And in one county he even lost to Ben Carson, who dropped out of the race a month ago, Colbert reported.
Though, to be fair, Dr. Carson may not be aware that he dropped out of the race.
But even though Cruz was beaten like a speed bag in a loose suit, at the end of the night Ted Cruz managed to keep it positive, and also kind of creepy, Colbert continued before playing a clip of Cruz talking about America lying down with her back on the mat during his concession speech.Colbert smiled and chuckled and then interpreted Cruz s words.
That is when America is at her best, lying down with her back on the mat, lights on and with a firm handshake and then back to your separate beds for some quiet weeping.
If you know what I mean.
Here s the video via YouTube.If Ted Cruz learned anything from his loss on Tuesday, it s that you should avoid insulting an entire state when you are trailing your opponent in a race you desperately want to win, especially if your opponent is a native of the state you are insulting.Cruz had hoped that New Yorkers would forget all about what he said about them and vote for him anyway.
He was wrong.
