At the close of the election, upon finding out that he lost the popular vote, Donald Trump made the bold accusation that there were millions of illegal votes, most especially in California.Well, because irony is the favorite theme of the Trump administration, as truth would have it, it was actually a Trump voter who tried to cast illegal ballots for Trump in Iowa.According to CBS News: A woman from Des Moines, Iowa, pleaded guilty to election misconduct for attempting to cast two separate ballots in the 2016 presidential election for then-Republican nominee Donald Trump.According to the Associated Press, Terri Lynn Rote, 57, entered her plea for the felony charge on June 27.
Court documents state that lawyers affiliated with the case are recommending Rote face up to two years of probation with community service on the side.
Further: Rote told police why she tried to vote more than once.
She was convinced her first vote for Mr. Trump would be manipulated and changed to a vote for then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to her statement to the police, Rote believed Mr. Trump s claims about widespread election rigging.
So, if you thought Trump lying to his supporters didn t actually have an effect on them, you would be wrong.
His lies not only were inaccurate but got this gullible voter in a lot of trouble.The irony of all of this is beyond hilarious considering we were all told by Trump that it was the liberals who were up to no good.
And by saying it was the liberals who were up to no good caused his own supporters to literally be up to no good and attempt to tamper with election results thus resulting in a guilty plea.Between this and the Russia scandal, it s more than obvious the actual criminal was put in office by the Electoral College.Featured Image by Getty Images
