cnn mostly dismisses the clinton e-mail scandal and just brushes over it but john king makes a great point this morning : sunday on cnn s inside politics , host john king pointed to a washington post story detailing that within 24 hours of her telling abc news last year that she was , dead broke after leaving the white house the clinton gave speeches making $ 700,000 in fees.king said , the washington post story this past week saying within 24 hours of saying we were dead broke to justify making some money , the clintons combined made $ 700,000 in speeches .
that is going to be tee-ball for the republicans .
maggie haberman of the new york times said , what you just said , i suspect will have more residence than the emails .
