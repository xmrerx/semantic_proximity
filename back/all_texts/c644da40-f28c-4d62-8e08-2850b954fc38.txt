On top of failing to pay charities for months after the fundraiser, despite already having beneficiaries listed, it turns out Donald Trump actually lied about how much was raised to the tune of around a million and a half dollars.
And now, four months later, his campaign is admitting it.In fact, as of this time, only a little over three million has actually been paid out, meaning it s possible that even the new number given by the Trump s campaign is false.
That, or worse, it simply disappeared.
According to his campaign, donations were pledged that were not received.
But that begs the question: If $4.5 million was definitely raised, where did it go?In any case, the amount of time between the fundraiser and actually paying the money is questionable, and Trump has been called out by many people for it including Sandra Miniutti, the vice president for Charity Navigator, a service that rates charities:In recent weeks, Trump and his campaign repeatedly declined to give new details about how much they have given away.
Why should I give you records?
Trump said in an interview with The Post this month.
I don t have to give you records.
In the past few days, The Post has interviewed 22 veterans charities that received donations as a result of Trump s fundraiser.
None of them have reported receiving personal donations from Trump.Did Trump make good on his promise to give from his personal funds?
The money is fully spent.
