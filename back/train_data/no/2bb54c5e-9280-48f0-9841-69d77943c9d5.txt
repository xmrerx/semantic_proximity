la paz ( reuters ) - more than half the ballots cast in bolivia s judicial elections on sunday were spoiled , or nullified , by voters , a sign that the opposition said showed dwindling support for president evo morales .
tensions are high in bolivia after the constitutional court last week gave morales the green light to run for a fourth straight term in 2019 .
morales opponents encouraged voters to spoil their ballots in protest of the ruling .
morales , a former coca farmer in power since 2006 , had previously accepted the results of a referendum in 2016 , when 51 percent of voters rejected his proposal to end term limits .
the citizens have defeated evo morales , a leader who is trying to impose re-election on bolivia , along with corruption and the manipulation of the justice system , businessman and former presidential candidate samuel doria medina tweeted .
the 26 judges elected on sunday will be seated in january .
morales said in a news conference on monday that the high number of spoiled ballots should not be seen as a protest against him , but as an attempt by the opposition to block his plan for a judiciary with elected rather than appointed judges .
the unpatriotic right wing wanted the election of an organic judiciary to fail , but the people have elected their authorities ; judges who answer to the people , not to politicians , morales said .
the 96 candidates on the ballot were preselected by congress , where morales has a majority .
opposition leaders said the vote was a ploy to give morales supporters control over the electoral court .
ballots were spoiled by marking more than one candidate , scratching or ripping the papers or doodling on them .
a preliminary report by bolivia s elections authority said 78 percent of the country s 6.4 million eligible voters participated in the election and that more than 50 percent of the ballots cast were spoiled .
