While Bernie Sanders is nowhere near ready to concede defeat in the Democratic primary race, on Thursday the Vermont Senator vowed to bring the most progressive agenda that any party has ever seen to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.According to Fortune, Sanders and his backers have not yet decided on all of the issues they will press for during the convention, which is scheduled to take place at the end of July.But on Monday Senator Sanders listed single-payer healthcare and a comprehensive climate change plan as issues the Democratic party would need to adopt if they hoped to gain support from his backers.Later in the week, during an interview with CNN, Jane Sanders pointed to election reform as another of the campaign s top issues.Mrs.
Sanders said during the interview: One of the things that we will be fighting for on the platform, whether he s the candidate or not, is electoral reform.
The process needs to change.
We need an open electoral system, same-day registration and open primaries.
According to Fortune, Sanders team may also press the party to change primary rules, and to eliminate the use of superdelegates to determine the party s nominee, a system which many Democratic voters are uncomfortable with.Another item likely to be on Sanders agenda is a $15 federal minimum wage.With 14 primaries yet to be held, Sanders told a crowd of supporters at Purdue University on Wednesday that he s in this campaign to win and become the Democratic nominee.
Watch a video clip from the candidate s speech, via YouTube, below:While many pundits and pollsters say that Senator Sanders has little chance of winning the party s nomination, as Fortune reports here, win or lose, if Sanders captures at least 40 percent of pledged delegates during the primary, party rules provide a lot of room for his supporters to define the party s platform.It would not be the first time in history that such a maneuver has taken place.As Fortune reports:In the divisive 1980 Democratic convention, losing candidate and then-Senator Ted Kennedy battled with President Jimmy Carter over major platform points, bringing amendments to the convention floor in a show of defiance.
Kennedy was able to help push the Equal Rights Amendment into the party s platform.Few today would say that was a bad thing.Image: 4/29 Indianapolis, IN by Joe Raedle/Getty Images
