yaounde ( reuters ) - a girl with a bomb strapped to her walked into a mosque in northern cameroon where it exploded , killing five worshippers in an attack bearing the hallmarks of islamist militant group boko haram , authorities said .
the girl of 12 or 13 years old arrived at the sanda-wadjiri mosque in remote kolofata at the first call to prayer at between five and six a.m. , the governor of cameroon s far north region midjiyawa bakary told reuters by telephone .
the men were bowed in prayer when she came , bakary said .
five of the worshippers were killed and the bomber also .
he did not name any suspects , but boko haram has repeatedly used suicide bombers as well as strapping children with explosives to strike at civilian and military targets .
the nigerian jihadist group , which is now split into at least two factions , has been fighting for almost a decade to revive a medieval islamic caliphate in the lake chad region , where nigeria , cameroon , niger and chad meet .
allied forces from the four countries have routed it in much of the territory it once controlled , but the group has responded by scattering and stepping up attacks on civilians .
amnesty international said last week that boko haram had killed 381 civilians in nigeria and cameroon since the beginning of april , more than double that for the preceding five months .
of those , 158 of the deaths were in cameroon , which the rights group linked to a rise in suicide bombings , the deadliest of which killed 16 people in waza in july .
