ankara ( reuters ) - turkish security forces have killed 99 kurdish militants , including a high-ranking one , in operations in southeast turkey over the last two weeks , the armed forces said on saturday .
security forces targeted outposts and caves used by the militants for shelter and storage in the southeastern provinces of sirnak and hakkari , near the iraqi border , the military said in a statement .
ninety-nine terrorists have been neutralized .
one is in the so-called leading ranks , it said .
the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , considered a terrorist organization by the united states , turkey and the european union , has waged a more than three-decade insurgency against the state .
the pkk , which seeks autonomy for the largely kurdish southeast , has bases in the mountains on both sides of the turkey-iraq border and is frequently targeted by turkish security forces .
the operations , which were carried out between aug. 24 and sept. 7 , led to the seizure of 420 kg ( 925 lbs ) of ammonium nitrate , used to make explosives , as well as bombs , guns and rifles , the military said .
