Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has resisted this change in the past, saying that she is uncomfortable pushing an issue that could bring harm to transgender students.Via The New York Times: Ms. DeVos s unease was evident in a strongly worded statement she released on Wednesday night, in which she said she considered it a moral obligation for every school in America to protect all students from discrimination, bullying and harassment.Gay rights protesters have come out en mass to chant and protest for their rights to use the bathroom of their choice.
