the senate waited until christmas to quietly release a report on how much was dolled out to settle workplace harassment claims .
remember that you never approved this and they used your money to make the payments to accusers .
the amount is $ 1.5 million .
this needs to end .
the senators should pay for this on their own .
it s just too easy to settle using someone else s money your money ! via daily caller : as the christmas holiday weekend set in , the senate rules and administration committee released a report revealing the senate has spent $ 1.5 million on workplace harassment settlements since 1998.the data , provided by the office of compliance , a little known administrative body that has quietly settled dozens of complaints against congressional offices , provides little by way of details , beyond an itemized list of violations and the corresponding settlement.gop sen. richard shelby of alabama , who chairs the rules committee , said further particulars can not be made public , in order to respect the confidentiality afforded to victims.because we paid for these settlements , should we not have a right to know ?
