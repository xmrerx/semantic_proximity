Anthropologist Fuambai Ahmadu appeared on Tucker Carlson to defend female genital mutilation.
Her shocking commentary and acceptance of this horrible cultural ritual left us in shock.
Are there REALLY people out there who consider this to be in any way similar to male circumcision?
She tries to conflate the two but only makes Tucker Carlson wince.
I don t identify with the term FGM with the term mutilation, I don t know anybody in my family that does or my community.
And from over 25 years of research I ve done in the field, I would say the great majority of women who are affected by what I call female circumcision practices do not see themselves as mutilated.
Anthropologist Fuambai Ahmadu What she s really saying in the comment above is that because everyone SHE knows thinks this is ok, then we all need to accept it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKYTu7m95pQ
