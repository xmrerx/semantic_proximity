WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday it will exercise its enforcement discretion for all power plants in Florida, allowing them to operate without meeting all pollution controls to maintain electricity supplies across the state as a result of Hurricane Irma.
It said in a statement the no-action assurance will end on Sept. 26.
