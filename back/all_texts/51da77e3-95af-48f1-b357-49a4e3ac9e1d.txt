FOX News reporter John Roberts told President Trump that in an earlier interview, Hillary Clinton said she did not believe that the players taking a knee in the NFL was about disrespecting the flag.
Roberts mentioned that Trump fired back in a tweet that he hoped Hillary would run again in 2020.
Trump interrupted to say: Oh I hope Hillary runs!
Is she going to run?
Please, Hillary, run again!
Trump responded that her way of agreeing with the players disrespecting our flag is the reason she lost the election, saying, Well, that s why she l the election.
I mean honestly, it s that thinking is why she lost the election.
Trump said that he believes that Hillary s statement in itself, is very disrespectful to our country.
Watch:Will someone please tell Crooked Hillary that America doesn t care about her opinion, and if we did, we would have elected her as our next President.
Here s the hilarious tweet from President Trump on Monday morning that John Robert s was referring to: I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020?
My answer was, I hope so!
