washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama said on monday he was “ cautiously optimistic ” that the u.s. congress would support the trans-pacific partnership trade pact his administration made with asian countries .
speaking to state governors at the white house , obama said he would have to rely on votes from pro-trade democrats and republicans since labor leaders opposed the deal .
obama noted that republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and republican speaker of the house of representatives paul ryan had largely been supportive of the pact .
passing the deal would be a legacy-defining achievement during obama ’ s final year in office .
