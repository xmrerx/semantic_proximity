Filmmaker Michael Moore, who was born in Flint, Michigan, recently ripped Gov.
Rick Snyder (R) and other GOP lawmakers for keeping the city s unsafe water a secret not only from the predominately minority population, but the federal government.In an impassioned speech to reporters, Moore accused Snyder and Michigan Republicans for killing those 10 people.
Moore said: This is not a mistake.
Ten people have been killed here because of a political decision.
They did this.
They knew.
Moore said that the state s GOP politicians had continued to provide Flint s citizens with polluted water from the Flint River to cut costs.
As a result, the state Department of Environmental Quality had failed to call for corrosion control chemicals to be added to the water, resulting in lead entering the water from pipes.
Moore insisted that what is being called the Flint water crisis is not actually a crisis at all it was a planned, measured decision by lawmakers that are now trying to deflect blame.
Moore urged the media and others to call the Flint water crisis what it really is murder: We need to start using the proper words when we talk about this.
Ten people have been killed in Flint because of Legionnaire s disease now that has broken out here.
And I want the media to please use the word kill.
If it was ten people killed in a tornado, you d say ten people killed.
Moore ripped Michigan s Republicans for making political decisions that put at risk the lives of people in a city that is majority African-American, where 41 percent live below the official poverty line.
It s a crisis created by the Republican governor and is visited upon a city that is majority black and majority poor.
Speaking over the angry chants of protesters in the background, Moore said: There are people who are very angry here, because their lives are at risk.
They should be angry.
We are all angry.
