brussels ( reuters ) - rescuers on monday found the body of a belgian army helicopter pilot who had disappeared in a mysterious midair incident at a weekend airshow , local media said .
investigators are trying to determine how and why the unnamed pilot left the controls of his agusta a-109 on sunday and ended up dead hundreds of meters below .
the belgian armed forces said in a statement that the pilot had fallen from the aircraft but that the co-pilot , alone on board , had landed it safely .
public broadcaster rtbf , quoting public prosecutors , said the co-pilot told them he was watching three skydivers who had just jumped from the helicopter .
when he turned back round , the pilot s seat was empty and the door of the aircraft was open .
