The Toddler-in-Chief has been busy this morning lashing out at Hillary Clinton, John Podesta s brother and vigorously trying to prove that former President Barack Obama had his phones wiretapped, a conspiracy theory which has never been backed by evidence.
And now Trump tagged the FBI s Twitter account (and that s totally not weird at all, k?)
to alert the agency to allegations by Fox News of electronic surveillance against him.Trump tweeted, @FoxNews from multiple sources: There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump.
This is unprecedented.
@FBI .

@FBI Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2017Earlier, Trump tweeted, Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends.
Spied on before nomination.
The real story.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2017That didn t go down well on Twitter.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FBI "Quick, the guy we're investigating for corruption just tweeted some Fox News bullshit put Russia on hold!"

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FBI NOBODY WIRE-TAPPED TRUMP.The FBI wiretapped some shady Russians.Trump was caught because he was in contact w the shady Russians.
Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) April 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FBI Why did you tag the FBI when you can get the info from them?
You don't have to wait for FOX.
This is unprecedented.
You are the President.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) April 3, 2017@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FBI Ha ha ha!
He is tagging the FBI with Fox news "Intel"!
You just can't make this shit up Carlos El Trucker (@jcm209) April 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FBI YES!
We, THE PRESIDENT, need to watch FOX NEWS to get our intel, and we relay this intel to the FBI via posting it on TWITTER!
This is #MAGA Christoph Rehage (@crehage) April 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends On this matter, we must follow the President's own words pic.twitter.com/qAupTOxXya Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) April 3, 2017Trump has been critical in the past of media outlets using anonymous sources, but to the surprise of no one, he s not doing that in this instance as he deflects from his Russia scandal.As president , Trump has access to U.S. intelligence agencies, the same ones he s blasted in the recent past.
Instead, though, Trump s go-to source for information is cable news.Early this morning, Trump lashed out at Hillary Clinton to try to get the public to focus on her instead of his own Russia scandal.
Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted?
Did Hillary know?
he tweeted just after 6:00 in the morning.The amateur president followed that tweet up with another one, saying, Did Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate?
Just asking!
Well, Donald, she isn t the President.
Apparently, he doesn t know that.
Has Donald apologized for that botched mission in Yemen yet?
Or his birther conspiracy theories about America s first black President?
Or how about his pussy grabbing remarks in which he advocates for sexual assault.
Or calling Mexicans rapists.
Instead of apologizing, he doubles down.
It s what he does.Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images.
