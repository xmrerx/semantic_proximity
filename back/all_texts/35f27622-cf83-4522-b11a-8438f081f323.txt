When listening to Donald Trump one really can t believe anything he actually says without tangible proof.
Let s just say he s not the most honest fellow, and he s a guy who really likes to talk himself up, regardless of facts.One of the biggest falsifications of actual events that Trump has gotten caught doing is with his supposed donations to Veteran groups.
Then when called out on these pretty blatant falsehoods by reporters, he verbally assaults them because he doesn t like people calling him out on his lies.Noticing these lies and misrepresentations of actualities is Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.
Just imagine if it were her greatly exaggerating claims of raising money for Veterans and donations made by herself to organizations.
She would get eaten alive by the press and it would likely be a major game-changer.Clinton called in live to CNN regarding Trump, and said: Well, I think the problem here is the difference between what Donald Trump says and what Donald Trump does.
He s bragged for months about raising six million dollars for veterans and donating a million dollars himself.
But it took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting the money to Veterans.
So, look, I m glad he finally did, but I don t know that he should get much credit for that.
And she s absolutely correct, and it s likely very true that if Trump hadn t been called out then those donations probably still would not have been made.Donald Trump loves Donald Trump more than anyone else on this planet, and like everyone else, when someone goes after the one you love you may get brutally defensive, as we ve witnessed with the media scrutinization of Trump s supposed donations.
And if he can t handle the scutinization from the press, how the hell is he going to handle being leader of the free world?Listen here: Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump was shamed into actually making his contribution to veterans https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/YBtMm3adVE CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 31, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
