because 6 year old girls are consumed with their sexual identities right ?
the parents should be getting regular visits by social services and the fired school manager and teacher should be reinstated and given an award for the courage to do the right thing two school staff members say they were fired for refusing to call a six-year-old girl a boy and addressing her by a new masculine name.according to madeline kirksey , a manager at the children s lighthouse learning center in katy , texas , her staff was told a six-year-old student is transgender after the child s parents cut her hair short , fox26 reported .
they were instructed to begin referring to the student as a boy and call her by a boy s name.school administrators reportedly gave staff a handout to refer to when addressing questions from other students .
it caused confusion , kirksey told fox26 .
i don t think we should be talking to other people s children who are under the age of 18 about being transgender .
she said the school fired her after she insisted the parents of other students be notified and allowed to address the issue with their children.not only where the other students disoriented by the sudden change , but the transgender student seemed to be confused as well .
one day , she wanted to be a girl , the next day she wanted to be a boy , kirksey said .
the other kids are confused as well , calling her a boy and she would start screaming , i m not a boy !
among the reasons stated in her termination letter was that kirksey does not follow instructions when requested to call a transgender child by the child s new name .
another teacher says she was also fired for raising concerns about all the confusion , according to fox26 .
