dinesh d sousa warned us about obama s reduction of our nation s nuclear stockpile in his movie , 2016 , obama s america .
shortly after his blockbuster movie appeared in theaters across america , dinesh d souza was charged with violating federal campaign finance laws and was sentenced to five years of probation , a $ 30,000 fine , and eight months in a san diego community confinement center where he was forced to undergo therapeutic counseling .
here is what dinesh d souza predicted : driven by the alleged anti-colonialist ideology of a father he barely met , president barack obama systematically is undermining america economically and militarily leaving it vulnerable to financial collapse , and even as unlikely as the possibility may seem , nuclear attack.and it charges as he slashes the defense budget , obama is simultaneously pushing to reduce the nation s nuclear stockpile to as low as a few hundred missiles even as other countries like china , russia and north korea are modernizing and expanding their arsenals , and iran widely believed to be close to developing nuclear weapons is threatening to annihilate israel .
from dinesh d sousa s controversial 2010 book , the roots of obama s rage wndhere is what is actually happening today : the united states cut its nuclear stockpiles by 20 percent between 1996 and 2013 , with more reductions likely to come , according to recently declassified information released by the white house.stockpiles of highly enriched uranium , or heu , which is used to fuel a nuclear weapon , were cut from 740.7 metric tons to 586.6 metric tons from 1996 to 2013 , according to recently declassified information made available by the obama administration .
this reflects a reduction of over 20 percent , the white house announced .
moreover , further reductions in the inventory are ongoing ; the u.s. department of energy s material disposition program has down-blended 7.1 metric tons of heu since september 30 , 2013 , and continues to make progress in this area .
the stockpile reductions are part of an effort by the obama administration to eliminate nuclear materials and move away from these types of weapons.the move comes as countries such as russia and north korea move to increase their nuclear stockpiles .
russia , for instance , has made several announcements about its intent to boost its nuclear stockpile and number of weapons.however , the united states is moving in the opposite direction.via : wfb
