oslo ( reuters ) - a former senior norwegian police officer was sentenced to 21 years in prison on monday for aiding drug smugglers and taking bribes in a case that captivated a nation accustomed to clean law enforcement .
eirik jensen , 60 , now retired , was once in charge of combating oslo s criminal gangs .
he had denied the accusations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal .
prosecutors accused jensen of aiding a smuggling ring for more than a decade by providing information on police and customs staffing , much of it via hundreds of cryptic mobile phone text messages , in return for illegal payments .
jensen s co-defendant gjermund cappelen , who admitted organizing the imports of tonnes of hashish , was the prosecution s key witness and was sentenced to 15 years in prison .
this case is unique in norwegian legal history , oslo district court judge kim heger said as he read the unanimous verdict against the police officer .
jensen has actively and deliberately contributed to a well-organized and extensive import of hashish , he said .
jensen and his lawyers argued during the trial that the evidence of contact with criminals was merely a result of normal police work intended to extract information and that he had not received any money or gifts .
we lost the battle , but we hope to win the war , jensen s attorney john christian elden told reporters after the verdict was made public .
there will be an appeal .
such cases are rare in norway , ranked the world s sixth-least corrupt country by watchdog transparency international , and this case generated vast media coverage , including an unusual live television broadcast of parts of the trial .
in neighboring finland , also among the least corrupt nations , the former head of helsinki s drug squad was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for drug smuggling , official misconduct and other crimes , including tampering with evidence .
that case is the subject of an appeal .
