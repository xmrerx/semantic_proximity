during the first half of their extended post-election coverage wednesday evening , nbc nightly news seemed to be setting the ground work for four years of a president donald trump all while stoking the left s anxieties .
there were gasps around the world .
headlines , trumpocalypse and disunited states hyped nbc s chief foreign correspondent richard engel as he delved into the ridiculous , but there are deeper concerns tonight that the world s shining light of democracy has gone dark .
you can not look at president trump and call the american president the leader of the free world fretted the leftist eurasia group president ian bremmer to engel , because america has increasingly abdicated its legitimacy to that title .
engel claimed that the only world leaders to welcome a president trump was a vast array of some of the world worst despots , those welcoming the most were right-wing parties , who rushed to embrace trump as their new hero .
engels was eager to tie as many of them to trump as possible : he s like me , joked the filipino president , accused of turning his police into anti-narco death squads .
egypt s general sisi , who came to power in a coup bragged he was the first foreign leader to congratulate trump .
and hungary s victor orban who did wall out his country to keep out refugees called trump great news .
and of course , russia s vladimir putin .
