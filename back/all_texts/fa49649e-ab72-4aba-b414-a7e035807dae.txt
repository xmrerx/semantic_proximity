In an interview with Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito, Donald Trump managed to utter one of the dumbest series of sentences in human history:I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn t have had the Civil War.
He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart, and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War.
He said, There s no reason for this.
People don t realize, you know, the Civil War, you think about it, why?People don t ask that question.
But why was there the Civil War?
Why could that one not have been worked out?Now, if Trump was an intelligent human being, he might admit he is completely uneducated regarding Andrew Jackson, the Civil War, and pretty much everything else.
He would apologize.
He would say he was wrong.
But Trump?
Well, he s a f*cking moron.In what appears to be an effort to convince people he was somehow right when he claimed that Andrew Jackson used the psychic powers bestowed upon him by Satan himself in exchange for that whole Trail of Tears thing Steve Bannon keeps saying we should do again (at least, we can reasonably assume Bannon says that) to foresee a conflict that occurred 16 years after his death and he was f*cking pissed about it.President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry.
Would never have let it happen!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017Andrew Jackson would have, had he actually possessed the magical ability to foresee the future, almost certainly used his powers for evil.
Slaves represented the majority of Jackson s income.
He owned 150 of them when he died.
If Jackson had actually known what was coming, he would have done all he could to ensure a Southern victory you know, had he not died 16 years before the Civil War began.
Trump is correct that our seventh President would have been very angry about what he would certainly call the War of Northern Aggression, however had he had a heartbeat.Trump s attempt to smooth things over by claiming that Jackson was a psychic didn t quite go over in the world of Twitterville, with Americans stopping by to collectively ask What the f*ck is wrong with you?
@realDonaldTrump You wish that Andrew Jackson an owner of HUNDREDS of slaves should've just made a deal w the South to allow slavery?!

Just wondering because pragmatically, that s a slave owners view.

Margaret Owens (@Margaret_Chloe_) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump He owned slaves, caused the Trail of Tears, and didn t care about human rights.
You need to read a history book.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump What did Andrew Jackson see coming??
He had 150 slaves Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump You stupid motherfucker.
BenDavid Grabinski (@bdgrabinski) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Andrew Jackson committed genocide.
He was a butcher & was a slave owner who believed in the institution.

Did they do it in crayon so would (kind of) understand some of it?
Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Yes, from his deathbed, the slaveowner had a vision of a war over slavery and was super pissed about it.
A++ analysis, as usual!
Jason Bailey (@jasondashbailey) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump We have a new contender for the most insane thing you ve ever said, and there s a lot of competition.
Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Ha!
A slave breeding, slave trading, genocidal, ethnic cleansing, venal, vindictive heart of ashes?
No civil war?
Jackson?
Emancipation?
Ha!

We should probably demand that Republicans think about their country for a goddamn second and get him out of office while we still have a country to MAGA at all.Featured image via Getty Images (Alex Wong)/screengrab
