this video will leave you breathless , as you watch a ny democrat out the democrat party and the unbelievable voter fraud the commit .
mayor deblasio and hillary should be sharing a cell together !
the manhattan democratic representative on the city s board of elections was caught on a secret video slamming mayor bill de blasio s municipal id program as contributing to all kinds of fraud including at the polls .
he gave out id cards , de blasio .
that s in lieu of a driver s license , but you can use it for anything , commissioner alan schulkin said in the undercover video recorded by a muckraker for conservative nonprofit project veritas .
but they didn t vet people to see who they really are .
anybody can go in there and say , i am joe smith , i want an id card , he said in the bombshell tape .
it s absurd .
there is a lot of fraud .
not just voter fraud , all kinds of fraud .
.
.
this is why i get more conservative as i get older .
schulkin didn t hold back to the undercover journalist , who identified herself as a political consultant at a united federation of teachers holiday party on dec. 16.not realizing he was being recorded , he broke with his own party s position that voter id requirements hurt the poor and minorities.schulkin said he backed the ids to prevent rampant fraud .
the law says you can t ask for anything .
which they really should be able to do , schulkin said , according to a copy of the video and transcript provided to the post .
i believe they should be able to do it , he added.the videographer asked point-blank , you think they should have voter id in new york ?
schulkin responded , voters ?
yeah , they should ask for your id .
i think there is a lot of voter fraud .
conservatives claim id checks help curb voter fraud.liberal and civil rights groups argue such rules discourage voting and discriminate against minorities and the poor .
you know , i don t think it s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an id .
.
.
you go into a building , you have to show them your id , schulkin said.while discussing the potential for fraud , schulkin volunteered that in some parts of the city , they bus people around to vote .
.
.
they put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site .
asked which neighborhoods , schulkin said , i don t want to say .
when the undercover mentions black and hispanic neighborhoods , schulkin responded , yeah .
.
.
and chinese , too .
at another point in the conversation , he discussed potential absentee ballot fraud .
oh , there s thousands of absentee ballots .
.
.
i don t know where they came from , he said.the undercover offered that people can cover their faces to shield their identity when voting , which triggered a conversation about burqas .
the muslims can do that , too .
you don t know who they are , schulman said .
