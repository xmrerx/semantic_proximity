Trump and the House GOP suffered a stunning defeat on legislation they promised would deliver better healthcare to millions, despite that promise being a lie.
They pulled the Trumpcare bill from the floor early Friday afternoon, before getting a vote, because they knew it wouldn t pass.
And that was absolutely humiliating for them.But what may be more humiliating is what the American Action Network a conservative PAC did on Friday night the exact same day the bill failed.
During Friday night basketball games, they ran television ads about the triumph of Trumpcare over Obamacare, saying the following: Republicans are keeping their promise with a new plan for better hrealthcare, More choices and lower costs, putting doctors and patients in charge again.
No more big government penalties or job killing mandates.
They go on to explain that the tax credits contained within Trumpcare would make healthcare more affordable, and that protections for people with pre-existing conditions would remain in place (which wasn t necessarily true).And then they do something truly amazing, given that these ads ran long after all the drama from the bill s death had quieted down.

That just makes them look completely moronic.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
