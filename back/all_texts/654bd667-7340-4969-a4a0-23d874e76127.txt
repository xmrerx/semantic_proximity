WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Susan Collins, a moderate who has opposed the Senate’s draft healthcare bill, said on Thursday the legislation needs a “major overhaul” and that it would be better to work with Democrats toward a compromise.
“From my perspective, the bill needs a lot more than tweaking or tinkering around the edges,” Collins told MSNBC.
“It needs a major overhaul.” Collins said she had conversations with several Democrats who are wiling to negotiate on healthcare but had been discouraged by their leadership from doing so.
“But I hope after we get past this stage that we can sit down and negotiate a bill,” she said.
