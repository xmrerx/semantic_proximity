Donald Trump has managed to attract the most racist and Islamophobic of American voters.
That was all on display in Rock Hill, South Carolina, at a Friday night campaign rally when a Muslim woman, 56-year-old Rose Hamid, was thrown out by Trump security.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK0Otof0wow]Rose, dressed in traditional Islamic dress and a t-shirt that read I come in Peace, was sitting in the stands directly behind Trump when Trump supporters, at the urging of his campaign staff, began to chant Trump s name after Rose stood up when Trump suggested that Syrian refugees were affiliated with ISIS.
Rose simply stood up and stayed silent when she began to be heckled, which eventually led to her removal by Trump s security.Hamid later said that she came to the rally to let Trump supporters see what a Muslim looks like so I figured that I d give them the opportunity to meet one.
She said that many were shouting epithets at her.
She said that one man yelled, You have a bomb, you have a bomb.
Trump made an ironic comment at her, making the victim of the night the victimizer.
Trump said: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable.
It s their hatred, it s not our hatred.
Major Steven Thompson of the Rock Hill Police Department said that Hamid was removed from the rally because the campaign advised him before the event that anybody who made any kind of disturbance should be immediately ejected.However, it s clear from the video that Hamid was not making a disturbance.
It s become commonplace for Trump supporters to remove and sometimes beat individuals who challenge his stance on racist and anti-Islamic dogma which has attracted followers from across the country.This is Trump s America, and as can clearly be seen from the video, if this person gets to power, we are all in trouble.Featured image via YouTube Screenshot.
