WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anthony Scaramucci, a Republican fundraiser and founder of Skybridge Capital, is President Donald Trump’s choice to become ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a White House official said on Thursday.
Scaramucci was an adviser to Trump during the presidential campaign last year and Trump’s transition to the White House.
He had been seen as someone headed for a White House position but a job never came to fruition.
The OECD position is in Paris.
