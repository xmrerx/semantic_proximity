Less than a week after her father left office on a nearly historically high approval rating, First Daughter Malia Obama is dipping her hat into politics, sort of.According to the former President, both his daughters were disappointed that Donald Trump won, but they are both still hopeful.
Malia is taking that hope and standing up for the Native Americans at Standing Rock.Malia, who s now 18, skipped a well-earned post presidential family vacation and opted instead to go to the Sundance Film Festival.
It was there, in Park City, Utah, where Malia joined a protest against Trump and against the oil companies insisting on putting a pipeline through sacred land.And this past Monday, just four days after her father vacated the Oval Office, Malia made it clear just how disappointed she was in the new commander-in-chief by joining a rally protesting his plans to revive the Dakota Access pipeline project.The 18-year-old student, who will be heading off to Harvard University later this year, was one of approximately 100 people who gathered on Main Street at the Sundance Film Festival to let it be known how upset she was with President Trump s plan to move forward with the controversial transport system.The group braved the blistering cold and heavy snowfall as they held up signs reading Exist.
Resist.

and Impeach corporate control.

This was after months of protests.In his first week in office, Donald Trump reversed that decision and chose to screw the Standing Rock Sioux by signing an executive order that would allow the pipeline to go forward.
That s what Malia is protesting.
Look for this to be the first in a brilliant young woman s life as an activist, if not a politician.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images.
