dublin ( reuters ) - the deal propping up the irish government will be dead if opposition party fianna fail submits a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister before a 1100 deadline , employment minister regina doherty said on friday .
it had been unclear whether the ruling party considered submitting the motion sufficient to violate the terms of the three-year deal , which prime minister leo varadkar s minority government depends on to rule , or whether it would consider the deal broken only when a vote on the motion was taken .
