Chicago police officer Robert Rialmo shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier, a mentally ill college student, in his family s home the day after Christmas in 2015.
One of the police officer s rounds also struck and killed their 55-year-old neighbor, Bettie Jones.
Now Rialmo is suing LeGrier s family for emotional distress.
Ther are 911 calls that show that LeGrier called the police three times only to be hung up on by the dispatcher.How much does Rialmo think that the emotional distress he has endured is worth?
$10 million dollars.
Seriously, this cop thinks that he can kill this family s son and neighbor, get away with it, and then make away with a fortune.The Chicago Tribune reports: Rialmo s lawsuit provides the officer s first public account of the Dec. 26 shooting in the West Garfield Park neighborhood.
It says Rialmo opened fire after Quintonio LeGrier twice swung a bat at his head at close range, and LeGrier was shot when Rialmo saw him raising the bat again and thought LeGrier could kill him if LeGrier hit him in the head with the bat.LeGrier s father, Antonio LeGrier, had filed a wrongful death lawsuit saying his son wasn t a threat, and Rialmo s lawsuit, which asks for damages of more than $10 million, is a countersuit in that case.
Rialmo also fatally shot Antonio LeGrier s neighbor Bettie Jones, 55, in the confrontation, but police have said her death was accidental.
In 2015, the police killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
That s a staggering figure.
What s even worse is that none of those police officers have been prosecuted for any potential wrongdoing.
In the United States, if you are a cop you can kill someone and not have to worry about the consequences.
Apparently that is not good enough for some cops.
They saw how fast Darren Wilson got rich after he killed Michael Brown and have decided to get in on the action.You can watch a video report on the story, below.
