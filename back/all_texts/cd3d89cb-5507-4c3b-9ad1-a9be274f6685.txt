Trump s ongoing meltdown over fake news (the rest of us call it reporting) organizations entered what seems like its eighteenth year on Wednesday after NBC correctly reported on the Today show that companies like Wal-Mart and General Motors are pulling a fast one on Trump by saying that job creation that was going to happen anyway was because of him in an effort to trick him into liking them.But don t take NBC s word for it.The CEOs of Fiat Chrysler and Ford said job announcements were business decisions and not a result of pressure from Trump https://t.co/lh8MhyoIAf David Shepardson (@davidshepardson) January 18, 2017Nevertheless, Trump decried any reporting that does not place him as some kind of job creation wizard as fake news, the new right-wing term for facts in third person, nonetheless.Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G.M., Lockheed & others that jobs are coming back Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS.
Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts.
Came back because of me!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017Reuters reporter David Shepardson did ask the CEOs of Fiat Chrysler and Ford, both of whom confirmed that Trump has nothing to do with anything their companies do.The CEOs of Fiat Chrysler and Ford said job announcements were business decisions and not a result of pressure from Trump https://t.co/lh8MhyoIAf David Shepardson (@davidshepardson) January 18, 2017Trump s rant continued:"Bayer AG has pledged to add U.S. jobs and investments after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump, the latest in a string " @WSJ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017No wonder the Today Show on biased @NBC is doing so badly compared to its glorious past.
Little credibility!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017[Fun Fact: The Today Show celebrated a record-setting month in December]This massive outpouring of dumbf*ckery, of course, did not go unchecked for long.
The Internet swept in and was nice enough to remind Trump as they do as part of the ritual surrounding his moronic Twitter musings daily that he is an utter failure of a human being in every way..@realDonaldTrump No, they reported the truth.

@realDonaldTrump Just because the reporting doesn't fit your false narrative doesn't make it "fake."
You're setting a dangerous precedent.

Kris Sanchez (@KrisSanchez) January 18, 2017@realDonaldTrump so the only media we can trust are Golf Digest, Infowars, Breitbart, and your Twitter feed.
Got it.

@realDonaldTrump Honey you're about to be sworn in as President of the United States and you're frantically trashing a TV show.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 18, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nbc Jesus, are you just going to try to smear and discredit all mainstream media as President?
Total embarrassment.
Sad!
Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) January 18, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nbc just like The Apprentice, with Executive Producer DJT?
That's you!
Tanking just like your approval rating.
Sad!

Your thoughts?

If this is the sort of behavior we can expect from him as POTUS, we are totally f*cked.Featured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee
