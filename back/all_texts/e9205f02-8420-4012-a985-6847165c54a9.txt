NY Gov.
Andrew Cuomo (D) thinks he s the boss of you!
He banned all non-essential travel to Mississippi after the state passed a religious liberty bill that he called a hateful injustice against the LGBT community.
Can you believe this guy?
The bill, known as House Bill 1523 or the Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act, was signed into law by Mississippi Gov.
Phil Bryant (R) Tuesday and will go into effect July 1.The legislation guards against the discrimination of individuals, religious organizations and certain businesses who have sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions that marriage should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman.
Under the law, religious leaders can decline to solemnize any marriage or provide wedding-related services based on religious or moral objections.
In addition, Mississippians can decided whether or not to hire, terminate or discipline an individual whose conduct or religious beliefs are inconsistent with their own ideals.After the passage of the new law, Cuomo issued an order Tuesday that requires all New York State agencies, departments, boards and commissions to immediately review all requests for state funded or state sponsored travel to Mississippi.Last month, Cuomo did the same thing for travel to North Carolina.Read more: The Blaze
