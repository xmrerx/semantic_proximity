who even admits to doing this ?
i have to say that i just don t believe it .
if it is true , i have to question the sanity of both of these people .
it s not even the least bit funny except for result they called a truce ! via : the hilldemocratic presidential front-runner hillary clinton says she once went head-to-head with sen. john mccain ( r-ariz. ) in a drinking contest .
i haven t been in many [ drinking contests ] , but the most famous one , i suppose is the one i engaged in with sen. john mccain when he and i were on a congressional delegation and he kind of challenged me , clinton said in a video posted on her facebook page thursday .
we have our political differences , but we sat there drinking vodka .
clinton said that no winner was declared that both contestants agreed to pull out before things got out of control .
we both i think agreed to withdraw in honorable fashion i think after having reached the limits that either of us should have had , she said.// < !
