Twitter exploded when God Bless America was beautifully sung by American servicemen at the World Series on Tuesday night.
The left was triggered by the beautiful and patriotic song that they ve been trying to censor from MLB for some time.
Several recent articles by Slate and other publications call for God Bless America to be omitted from being played at games:NYDN reported: Major League Baseball must permanently retire God Bless America, a song that offends everyone The Yankees still play it at every game, but most teams, like my beloved Mets, play God Bless America only on Sundays or holidays.
But even that s too much.
This is why what happened during the seventh inning stretch for game one of the World Series is a beautiful thing:Major League Baseball hit it out of the park by playing a song that s even more despised by the left than the national anthem.
It was performed with a little help from American servicemen during the seventh inning stretch:God Bless America!
Thank you God and America!

A very sick mindset.Mike Dalager, a petty officer at the United States Coast Guard second class performs this rendition of God Bless America during the 7th inning stretch at Game 1 of the 2017 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros.
Great performance:
