beijing ( reuters ) - china s anti-graft watchdog said roughly 1.34 million lower-ranking officials have been punished since 2013 under president xi jinping s anti-corruption drive .
xi , who is preparing for a major communist party leadership conference later this month , has made an anti-graft campaign targeting tigers and flies , both high and low ranking officials , a core policy priority during his five-year term .
china is preparing for the 19th congress later this month , a twice-a-decade leadership event where xi is expected to consolidate power and promote his policy positions .
those punished for graft since 2013 include 648,000 village-level officials and most crimes were related to small scale corruption , said the central commission for discipline inspection ( ccdi ) on sunday .
while much of the country s anti-graft drive has targeted lower ranking village and county officials , several high-ranking figures have been taken down .
in august the head of the anti-graft committee for china s ministry of finance was himself put under investigation for suspected graft .
in september a senior military officer who sits on china s powerful central military commission , overseen by xi , was detained and questioned over corruption-related offenses , reuters reported .
the ccdi said 155,000 country-level party bureaux have set up corruption policing mechanisms as of august , representing 94.8 percent of total bureaus .
