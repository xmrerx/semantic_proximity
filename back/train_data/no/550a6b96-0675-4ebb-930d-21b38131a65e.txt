there was testimony today regarding illegal minors flooding our southern border .
john conyers said it s unamerican to stop them from crossing .
he struggled to read the prepared statement on illegal minors .
he claimed that illegals aren t committing an illegal act .
notice how he reclassifies illegals as refugees .
this is what the left wants to do with illegals .
if they all claim persecution then it s their ticket into the u.s .
it s how they feel and not something they have to prove .
yea , typical government stupidity .
so now we have a free for all at the border where anyone can come and they get in because they are now considered a refugee .
not to mention , obama just reinstated the catch and release program where the border patrol just releases the illegals once they catch them .
crazy !
