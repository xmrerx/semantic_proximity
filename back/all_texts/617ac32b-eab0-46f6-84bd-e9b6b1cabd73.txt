Sarah Palin has marked her return to the national stage as part of the Trump campaign with another doozy.
Palin s son Track a combat veteran was recently arrested on domestic violence charges.
He had a fight with his girlfriend, who told police that he threatened to kill himself with an AR-15 rifle.At a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Palin blamed her son s arrest on Obama.
It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore.
It starts from the top.
The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, Do you know what we go through?
Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us?
So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them, she said.President Obama has made the care and security of military members a priority since he was first elected.
At the top of that agenda was his decision to end the war in Iraq, which took thousands of American lives and permanently injured and disabled so many serving in the military.Obama has also sought to cut down on gun violence specifically the problem of soldiers driven to suicide who use guns to end their lives.By comparison, Palin was in favor of the invasion of Iraq, and was part of a failed presidential ticket that promised to bomb Iran, a proposition which would have put more American soldiers in harm s way, and in her rambling incoherent speech with Trump she attacked Obama for proposing gun safety measures.But this is the Palin technique.
A word salad with almost no meaning, combined with lies and deceptions in order to further the right wing s mission.Featured image via YouTube
