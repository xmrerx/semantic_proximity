Senators are increasingly pissed off about the group of Republicans who are writing a healthcare bill in secret.
They re supposed to vote on it very soon, Mitch McConnell is refusing to allow more than 10 hours of debate time to each party, and they don t like the idea of being forced to vote on something they haven t even seen.
Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine, made a point of hunting for the bill right before launching into a speech about Medicaid.Right as he was recognized, he apologized and asked for a moment because he was still looking for the healthcare bill.
The show he makes of doing that is perfect in light of the secrecy in which McConnell and his cohorts are busy working.
Watch below:!!

Republican Pete King, of New York, threw a livid fit about it during a radio interview.
He said that private meetings do have to happen, but there needs to be more public debate and he thinks it looks like they re trying to hide something.
He said it s too secretive, which will put a cloud over the whole final product.
John McCain, another Republican, told Bloomberg that he hasn t yet seen the bill either.
He also hasn t met any American that has, but he s sure the Russians hacked in and got most of it.And while most people aren t exactly thrilled with Cory Booker right now, he and a couple of his fellow Senators left the Senate building and tried hunting it down, including going over to the Congressional Budget Office to see if there was a copy there they could see.In other words, the GOP is really angering pretty much everyone with this.
It s especially hypocritical given that many who are in favor of this kind of secrecy were angry about the ACA allegedly being written and passed in secret (it wasn t).Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
