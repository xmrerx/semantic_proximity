there must be something in the water in washington how idiotic are these people ?
the senate armed services committee has asked for copies of defense secretary ash carter s personal emails after carter acknowledged in a statement that he had used a personal email .
the statement followed a new york times article saying it had obtained 72 of carter s work-related emails that he sent or received from a personal email account .
the times said it was given the emails in response to a freedom of information act request .
after reviewing his email practices earlier this year , the secretary believes that his previous , occasional use of personal email for work-related business , even for routine administrative issues and backed up to his official account , was a mistake , the statement from spokesman peter cook said .
as a result , he stopped such use of his personal email and further limited his use of email altogether .
with all the public attention surrounding the improper use of personal email by other administration officials , it is hard to believe that secretary carter would exercise the same error in judgment , sen. john mccain , an arizona republican and committee chairman , said in a statement ..
the senate armed services committee has requested copies of the emails and will be conducting a review to ensure that sensitive information was not compromised .
it s a mistake , and it s entirely my own , carter said , adding that i stopped when it was clear the practice was against policy .
just listen to our defense secretary apologize for using his personal e-mail for defense department business :
