watch what happens when laura loomer asks chelsea clinton to sign a copy of her book , she persisted for her friend , juanita broaddrick : because this book s for everyone , including women who have wanted to speak up but have been told to quiet down , can you sign it for a my friend juanita broaddrick ?
because she s been silenced by your parents , especially bill clinton , who s a rapist .
can you sign it for her ?
the funny thing is that chelsea was just offered a cool one million dollars to take a dna test to prove her real dad is webster hubbell : jones made the offer on the wednesday edition of the alex jones show while previewing an upcoming video showing chelsea being confronted on her father s alleged rape of juanita broaddrick .
we also have a woman confronting chelsea clinton who is now the spitting image of webster hubbell , no doubt , jones said .
in fact i ll offer chelsea clinton $ 1 million to the charity of her choice where she s looted billions out of haiti and other places so she doesn t care a million dollars to the charity of her choice to have a third-party group do a maternity or a paternity test on her and you know she s webster hubbell .
i mean you look at this new video we re gon na play when we come back , it is webster hubbell i mean it s webster hubbell .
those are some strong genes .
