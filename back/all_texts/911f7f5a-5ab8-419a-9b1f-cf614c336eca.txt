WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will not hold any talks with North Korea at this time, except for possible conversations about freeing U.S. citizens who have been detained there, the White House said on Monday.
We ve been clear that now is not the time to talk, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, amplifying on a tweet from President Donald Trump over the weekend that had been seen as undercutting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
The only conversations that have taken place, or that would, would be on bringing back Americans who have been detained, Sanders said.
Beyond that, there will be no conversations with North Korea at this time.
