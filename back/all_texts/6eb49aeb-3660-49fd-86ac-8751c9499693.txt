Saturday Night Live has been mocking Donald Trump mercilessly week after week.
But tonight, Alec Baldwin went no holds barred and gave his most brutal (and hilarious) performance yet.The skit spoofed Trump s interview with Lester Holt and from start to finish, they nailed Trump to the wall.
The scariest part about the beginning of this hilarious segment was that when it came to the serious issues, the punchline is that this isn t really fiction.SNL started off with Trump s firing of FBI Director James Comey, which everybody knows was over Russia.
And things got harsher from there.
Everything was on the table, from Paul Ryan s ass kissing to Trump s teeny weeny, there was no holding back.Trust me, you don t want to miss this one.
You really have to see it for yourself.
Not only for your own entertainment pleasure but so you will know exactly what Trump will be ranting about for the rest of the week.Trump is sure to lose his ever-loving mind when he sees SNL s skit and it is not going to be pretty.
I, for one, cannot wait.
