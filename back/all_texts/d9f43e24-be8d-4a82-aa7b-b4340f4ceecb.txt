Comey lied and has been caught in his lie What next?
FOIA request him again.
He said there were no tarmac documents but now it turns out there were.
Hundreds of documents were just recently turned over Oops!
It s also absurd that there were never, as James Comey said, any documents.
He signed a letter saying under penalty of perjury there are no documents relating to the tarmac meeting.
Now we know that there are hundreds of them.
So there are three possibilities here.
Either Comey lied or he didn t understand the request Either they ve lost the documents and they ve suddenly been found or they lied when they said there were no documents.
Or they didn t understand the request but the request by the way is standard boiler plate that every lawyer is familiar with.
