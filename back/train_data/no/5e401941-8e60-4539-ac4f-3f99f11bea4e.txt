washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. house of representatives narrowly approved legislation on tuesday that would restrict president barack obama ’ s ability to lift sanctions under the international nuclear deal with iran , nearly three weeks after a similar vote was canceled .
house members voted 246-181 to pass the “ iran terror finance transparency act , ” almost entirely along party lines , with almost every “ yes ” vote coming from republicans and democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it .
the legislation is not expected to become law , even though republicans control both the house and senate .
even if it were passed by the senate , obama has promised a veto , saying the measure would kill the landmark nuclear agreement .
the house narrowly passed the legislation last month , but the vote was voided after nearly a third of the chamber showed up too late to cast their votes .
the voided vote took place on jan. 13 .
on jan. 16 , u.s. and iranian authorities announced a complex deal in which iran released four american prisoners just as the international nuclear agreement was implemented .
congressional aides said the house vote was voided because the new house speaker , paul ryan , was pushing members to arrive for votes on time , not because of any connection to the prisoner deal .
democratic lawmakers noted that the repeated vote was not the only one in the house on tuesday that evoked references to “ groundhog day , ” the 1993 film in which the character played by the actor bill murray lives the same day over and over again .
the iran bill was passed just after house republicans tried and failed to override obama ’ s veto of legislation to repeal his healthcare law .
house republicans have voted more than 60 times to try to repeal the healthcare overhaul , one of the democratic president ’ s signature domestic policy achievements .
