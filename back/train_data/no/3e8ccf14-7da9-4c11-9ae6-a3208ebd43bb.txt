beijing ( reuters ) - a country s right to choose its own development path must be respected , chinese foreign minister wang yi told his venezuelan counterpart on friday , offering support for the strife-torn latin american nation .
the opec member is locked in a deep political and economic crisis , with more than 125 people killed during months of opposition protests earlier this year , drawing condemnation from the united states and europe .
meeting in beijing , wang told jorge arreaza that stability in venezuela was not only in his own people s interests , it was also the common wish of the international community , including china , china s foreign ministry said in a statement .
china wishes that venezuela maintains its trend of returning to stability , and encourages the resolution of the problems that exist via dialogue and consultation within a legal framework , the ministry cited wang as saying .
every country s right to go down a development path that accords with its national conditions should be respected , he added .
china and oil-rich venezuela have a close diplomatic and business relationship , especially in energy .
china has repeatedly brushed off widespread condemnation from the united states , europe and others about the situation in the country .
last month , china , along with russia , egypt and bolivia , boycotted an informal public u.n. security council meeting on venezuela organized by the united states .
on wednesday , venezuela s pro-government legislative superbody ruled that parties which boycotted this month s local elections had lost legitimacy , potentially eliminating the main opposition groups from the 2018 presidential race .
