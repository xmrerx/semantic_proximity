If you haven t heard about the ongoing battle between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren then you re clearly living under a rock, or possibly a newborn baby.
They ve been going back and forth on Twitter, in speeches, and every time he tries to call her goofy or Pocahontas (because he s apparently five years old) she smacks him down harder and harder.During her commencement address at Suffolk University this past weekend, Warren went after him yet again.Taking a brilliant dig, because let s face it, she s brilliant, Warren said: How s this speech polling so far?
Higher or lower than Donald Trump s unfavorable numbers with women?
If you weren t aware, Trump isn t doing so well with women, polling at 70% unfavorable.
But can we be all that surprised?
He s very misogynistic, constantly calling women names, and him going after Warren and then Hillary Clinton for actually being a woman, is just another example of that.Something tells me Warren isn t about to let up any time soon.
Trump can try his name-calling games, but when it comes to strong women who have had to fight twice as hard to get half as much recognition their whole lives, he s in for a big surprise.
Those games may work on weak Republican men, but just you wait.
Just.
You.
Wait.Watch her whole speech here:Featured image via video screen capture
