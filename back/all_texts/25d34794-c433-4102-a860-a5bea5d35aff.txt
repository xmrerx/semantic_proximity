WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Friday to fund the government through April and sent it to President Barack Obama for signing into law, after Democrats who sought more generous healthcare benefits for coal miners stopped delaying action on the measure.
Many government services and operations would have been closed or suspended starting at midnight, when current funding authority expires, if the Senate had not approved the measure.
The vote was 63-36.
The House of Representatives passed the legislation on Thursday.
