One man s stand for freedom ended disastrously when he forgot to look up.
YouTuber Latherland uploaded a clip on Thursday that shows a man attempting to make a patriotic, inspiring video that will convince the world to stand up to the tyrannical United States government.
You know what?
the unidentified man says in front of a backdrop of a whirring ceiling fan.
It s about time our people took a stand for freedom.
Inspiring.
The gentleman emphasizes his point by standing up on his bed, but apparently forgets the fan buzzing above him.
So you know what?
he says as he rises.
As a patriot, I m going to take a motherf*cking F*ck, sh*t, Our hero yelled as he bravely smashed his head into something hard.
God damn it.
F*ck.
The brave American then turned the camera off as he groaned in pain.For some reason, stupid people love to showcase their love of freedumb every chance they get, usually with some sort of moronic stunt like the American Flag-clad, Confederate flag-waving Murikan who set himself on fire like a bombastically stupid Tibetan monk while showing off his flag-waviness for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, or whatever the f*ck this is.Stupidity kills, and conservatives are full of it.
According to the mystical art in which they don t believe, science, there is a strong link between conservatism and low IQ.
In other words, they are exactly the sort of people who would not stop to think that ceiling fans make boom and ouch.
