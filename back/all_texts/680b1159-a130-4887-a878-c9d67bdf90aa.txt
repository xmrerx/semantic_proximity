In a CNN interview on Thursday, anchor Chris Cuomo asked Hillary Clinton if presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is qualified to be President of the United States.
Her answer was simple and to the point: No, I do not.
Question: "Do you think Donald Trump is qualified to be president?
""No, I do not."

At the same time, members of the intelligence community have already expressed concerns that Trump will even be allowed to receive classified briefings as the party nominees are traditionally given.That message will also likely be amplified in the multi-million dollar advertising and voter mobilization campaign that began this week from the super PAC Priorities USA.The attacks on Trump actually echo some of the attacks made by Democrats in 1964 against Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who is consider the godfather of modern right-wing conservatism.
President Lyndon Johnson s ad, Daisy, speculated that nuclear Armageddon could come if Goldwater was elected president.The ad was so effective, it only ran once.
That fall, Johnson defeated Goldwater in an epic landslide, 61% to 38%.Featured image via Twitter
