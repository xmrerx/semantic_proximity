At this point in Donald Trump s pathetic, failing presidency, it is no surprise that officials from other countries want nothing to do with him or America.
The country has been humiliated beyond belief as the orange child in the White House unleashes his reckless behavior on the world, and top officials are doing their best to do damage control.This week, Gareth Evans, the former Foreign Minister of Australia, sent out a major warning about Trump and urged Australia to gain more independence away from the United States thanks to Trump s trigger-happy behavior and recent attack on Syria.
Evans railed against Trump in his speech to Australia s National Press Club, calling Trump manifestly the most ill-informed, under-prepared, ethically challenged and psychologically ill-equipped president in US history.
Evans correctly observed that Trump should not be trusted to deliver consistent, coherent, constructive and cohesive outcomes over the next four years.
The former Australia Foreign Minster added: Personally driven by instinct and impulse, unhampered by knowledge or judgement, he has led an administration acting so far manifestly on the basis of postures, not of policies.
Evans urged Australia to depend more on itself and partners in Asia than on the United States, as Trump has made a partnership with America far too risky.
Evans said: We should have learned that lesson after Iraq in 2003.
You can watch Evans blast Trump s dangerous behavior below:Americans should be seriously considering what other world leaders and important officials are saying about Trump.
The fact that the rest of the world is horrified by what they see should be setting off red flags even among Trump s own supporters.
Never before have we seen such a response from the world, as Trump threatens to ruin everything he can get his tiny hands on.
Evans words are brutal, but deep down we know they re all true.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images
