jerusalem ( reuters ) - an israeli minister was not suggesting u.s. president donald trump s words could lead to war with iran when he reacted to the u.s. leader s speech concerning the nuclear deal with the islamic republic , the minister s spokesman said on saturday .

katz was not reacting to the question which the anchor added later whether the president s speech could lead to war with iran , the spokesman said , rather that the speech and new strategy could bring about a real change .
