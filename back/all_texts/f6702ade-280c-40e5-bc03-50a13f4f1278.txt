Yesterday, on the first day of the Republican National Convention (which turned out to be a complete disaster), Donald Trump introduced his plagiarizing wife, Melania, to the tune of Queen s 1977 hit rock ballad We Are the Champions.
The choice of song sparked outrage on social media (and rightfully so).
Freddie Mercury, lead singer of Queen, was gay and, for a portion of his life, stricken with AIDS.
This year s Republican platform is the most anti-LGBT in the party s history, and their vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov.
Mike Pence, is a notorious homophobe who curtailed vital HIV/AIDS resources in Indiana.So the question was asked: given how hostile the GOP and Trump/Pence are to LGBT rights, why on God s green earth would Queen allow one of their most iconic hits to be played at the parade of hate?Well, it turns out, Queen never authorized the use of their song.
In fact, the RNC actually went against their wishes:An unauthorised use at the Republican Convention against our wishes Queen Queen (@QueenWillRock) July 19, 2016Here s to hoping that the iconic band sues the hell out of the deficit stricken RNC.
Although Queen is against their music being used, the right to use it doesn t come from them but rather the performing rights organization Broadcast Music Inc, which the iconic song belongs to for distribution.However, it remains to be seen if BMI authorized its use.Knowing the Trump campaign and the stupidity of the RNC, it may actually be highly unlikely that they did, and no one would be shocked if it slipped their minds.Countless celebrities and musicians alike have banned Republicans from using their music, including Rage Against the Machine, Heart, Foo Fighters, the Rolling Stones, and Adele.
Queen apparently was on th list, but Republicans chose to ignore their wishes.
I wonder how long it will take them to blame Hillary Clinton for their mistake.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
