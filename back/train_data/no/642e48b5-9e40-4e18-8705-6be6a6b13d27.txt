moscow/beirut ( reuters ) - russian long-range bombers struck islamic state on friday in albu kamal in eastern syria , where the jihadists have staged a counter-attack after the syrian army declared victory over them .
six tu-22m3 bombers took off from bases in russia and overflew iran and iraq before launching the strike , the russian defense ministry said in a statement reported by russian news agencies .
albu kamal , a small town on the border with iraq , was islamic state s last syrian stronghold , along with some neighboring villages and desert areas .
the syrian army said it and its allies , including the lebanese hezbollah group , took it from the militants on nov. 9 and declared the fall of the terrorist daesh organization s project in the region .
islamic state fighters hidden in albu kamal launched a counter-attack days later and forced the army and its allies to pull out of albu kamal , residents said on nov. 13 .
the army , which has driven islamic state from huge swathes of central and eastern syria in a multi-pronged campaign this year , re-entered the town soon afterwards , a war monitor said .
tass cited the ministry as saying the planes had bombed islamic state fortified positions , militants , and armored vehicles .
satellite and drone surveillance had confirmed that all of the designated targets had been destroyed , it said .
