vienna ( reuters ) - austria s conservative people s party wants children who do not speak sufficient german to take compulsory language classes as a condition for being allowed to attend school , party leader sebastian kurz said on wednesday .
tens of thousands of migrants from the middle east , afghanistan and africa have arrived in austria in the past two years .
their integration has become an important political topic and kurz , whose party is the junior partner in a coalition government with the social democrats , has gained in popularity because of his hard stance on immigration .
though his proposal ostensibly applies to all children , public debate has centered around those from migrant backgrounds , most of whom are currently placed at school according to age .
they receive separate language lessons but teachers have said that this is not enough to integrate them .
one can only follow the curriculum if one s german is good enough , kurz said at a news conference in salzburg , where he presented his party s education program for parliamentary elections on oct. 15. who starts at school needs to understand the teaching language , the party chief said , echoing demands from the far-right freedom party .
