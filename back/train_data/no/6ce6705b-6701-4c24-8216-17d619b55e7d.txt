this is all part of google s color revolution business , and also part of the smart power complex used to manufacture public consent for humanitarian interventions globally.the leak also reveals how qatari network al jazeera played an active role in this plot too .
al jazeera has already been caught repeatedly manipulating international news throughout the middle east.in a just world , hillary would be held to account by the mainstream media for this revelation , but it seems that it s just being ignored by the mainstream gatekeepers rudy takala washington examinergoogle in 2012 sought to help insurgents overthrow syrian president bashar assad , according to state department emails receiving fresh scrutiny this week.messages between former secretary of state hillary clinton s team and one of the company s executives detailed the plan for google to get involved in the region .
please keep close hold , but my team is planning to launch a tool that will publicly track and map the defections in syria and which parts of the government they are coming from , jared cohen , the head of what was then the company s google ideas division , wrote in a july 2012 email to several top clinton officials .
