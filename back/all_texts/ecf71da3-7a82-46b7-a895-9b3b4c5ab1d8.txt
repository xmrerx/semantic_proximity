Ambassador John Bolton was on Lou Dobbs tonight to comment on the Susan Rice news.
It s being reported that she called for the unmasking of names for likely political reasons.
if that s the case then she can be charged with fraud She should lawyer up ASAP.
Reports are showing that the unmasking and spying increased as it came closer to Trump s inauguration.
That could be the clue that this was stricly political.
Who can forget her lies on 5 different morning shows after Benghazi.
She s clearly someone who has zero credibility and who should be investigated for using intelligence for political purposes.
Throw her in the slammer or give her immunity and make her talk?John Bolton This is stunning news.
And you can t, even somebody as senior as the National Security Advisor, can t just decide they d like to unmask names to find out whose name is involved in a particular intercept If she said that even somebody as senior as her but her real motivation was political she was committing a kind of fraud on the intelligence gathering system and if she participated in that kind of fraud to help the political misuse of that intelligence she s got serious legal problems here.

@AmbJohnBolton says Susan Rice defrauded the intelligence system: She s got real legal problems here.
