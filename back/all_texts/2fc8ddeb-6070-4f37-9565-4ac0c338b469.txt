WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury will enforce all sanctions against Russia unless a deal were reached between Washington and Moscow, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the department said on Thursday.
Asked during a Senate confirmation hearing if he was committed to enforcing existing sanctions against Russia, Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin said: “100 percent so.
And I think the president-elect has made it very clear that he would only change those sanctions if he got a better deal and we got something in return whether it was on nuclear arms or other areas.”
