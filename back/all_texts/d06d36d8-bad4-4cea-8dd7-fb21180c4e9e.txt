Until today, not one national poll had Clinton leading with male voters.
Some have gotten close, but Donald Trump has always managed to lock it up.
The gender gap that we have seen the last several elections was looking like a repeat for 2016.But now a new poll released the day of the third and final presidential debate shows Clinton now for the first time is leading with men.
The newest poll from Bloomberg Politics shows Clinton edging out Trump by 2 points with men (46 to 44) and 9 points overall (47-38).The poll was conducted from October 14-17 with responses from 1,006 likely voters.So a week after the game-changing audio tape was leaked in which Trump admits to sexually assaulting women men have started to turn against the Republican nominee, and for good reason.Clinton is already gaining in Republican strongholds white, college educated women, Cuban-Americans, young Republicans, Vietnamese-Americans, and now men.
Such gains have turned traditionally red states like Arizona, Georgia and Texas into reachable victories for Democrats.With Trump under-performing Romney in key swing states (and red states), Trump cannot afford to lose his key voting demographics, but the damage from the tape and the accusations of sexual assault have hurt him tremendously.Republican men have distanced themselves from Trump after the revelations were leaked, invoking their wives and daughters and granddaughters as reasons they cannot support the GOP nominee.
It s not clear if the shift in male support for Clinton comes from Independent or Republican defectors, but the numbers are slowly inching Clinton s way.With less than 20 days until election day, Trump is going to have to pivot hard if he hopes of bringing back all the defectors into his camp.
With early voting already underway, in which millions have already cast their ballots, the window of opportunity may have passed.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
