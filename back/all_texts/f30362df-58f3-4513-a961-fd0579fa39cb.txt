MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was set to add Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim as a target of his verbal attacks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

Trump will claim that Slim, as a donor to the Clinton Foundation charity and the largest single shareholder in The New York Times, has an interest in helping her White House campaign, the newspaper said.
Slim spokesman Arturo Elias told the Journal that the allegations that Mexico’s richest man was interfering in the U.S. election were “totally false Slim built his multibillion-dollar empire by purchasing troubled companies and turning them around.
