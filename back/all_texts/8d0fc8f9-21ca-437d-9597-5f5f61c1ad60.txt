The State Department redacted one sentence just one.
Cleaning up for our former Secretary of State is something the State Department has gotten really good at: FYI.
The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered.
That s it the one sentence that tells us so much.
Rand Paul was on to the answer.
Clinton slithered out of it .Among the emails released by the State Department today was one sent by Hillary Clinton to Jake Sullivan on April 8, 2011.
Clinton was forwarding a private intelligence report that Sidney Blumenthal had sent her with the subject line: UK game playing; new rebel strategists; Egypt moves in.
In the State Department release today, Clinton responds with FYI and a sentence that is redacted.But the New York Times posted its versions of the emails earlier this week and the sentence is not redacted.
In the Times s version the redacted sentence reads: FYI.
The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered.
The redaction in the State Department version is labeled a B5 Freedom of Information Act exception, which provides for a deliberative privilege in keeping the information from the public.The obvious question: Why did the State Department redact that sentence?Via: The Weekly Standard
