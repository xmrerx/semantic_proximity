athens ( reuters ) - a ruling by greece s top administrative court that two syrian asylum seekers can be safely returned to turkey sets a dangerous precedent for thousands of refugees , according to amnesty international .
about 62,000 refugees and migrants , mainly syrians , afghans and iraqis aiming for northern europe , have been stranded in greece since european countries closed their borders in march last year .
most live in overcrowded camps .
the ruling sets an ominous precedent for many other asylum-seekers who have fled conflict and persecution and are currently stranded on greek islands , said john dalhuisen , amnesty international s europe director .
these decisions breach a very clear principle - greece and the eu should not be sending asylum seekers and refugees back to a country in which they can not get effective protection , dalhuisen said .
greece s council of state on friday rejected the appeals of the two syrians against earlier rulings , declaring their asylum claims inadmissible .
the court rejected the syrians claims that their life and freedom would be in danger if they were returned to turkey , as the judges opined this did not emerge from any evidence , a court official said , declining to be named .
the court s ruling also took into consideration that the two syrians had links to turkey , because their families and relatives are there , the court official said .
if the two syrians are deported , it will mark the first formal return of asylum seekers from greece to turkey on the basis that turkey is a safe country since an eu-turkey deal came into force .
the eu-turkey deal , signed in march 2016 , aims to return asylum seekers from greek islands to turkey , which receives billions of euros in aid .
so far under the eu-turkey deal , only migrants who do not qualify for international protection have been forced to return .
some syrians have returned voluntarily , authorities say .
