brussels ( reuters ) - it is up to britain , rather than the european union , to make progress in divorce negotiations with the european union to enable the opening of talks on the future relationship , the spokesman for the european commission said on monday .
there is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one , which is the divorce proceedings , spokesman margaritis schinas told a regular briefing .
so the ball is entirely in the uk court for the rest to happen .
and the uk can always refer to the debate in the european plenary in strasbourg on the subject , he said , referring to last week s debate in the european parliament .
he was responding to excerpts made available of a speech british prime minister theresa may to britain s parliament later on monday in which she will say that as we look forward to the next stage , the ball is in their ( eu ) court .
