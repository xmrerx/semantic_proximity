If there s one thing Donald Trump wants, it s positive press about himself and everything that he is doing.
Clearly knowing that his new travel ban Executive Order wasn t going to shine him in the best light, or he was simply afraid of reporters asking him questions he d be forced to give an answer to, Trump didn t allow the press into the Oval Office for the signing.
The White House did, however, offer a photo of the signing, but CNN refuses to show it.CNN s John King explains why they won t show the image of Trump holding the Executive Order: We won t show you the picture of the president signing the executive order that s incredibly important to his administration, it s a very important policy debate in our country we will not show you the picture because we have a policy that you cannot have canned press release pictures from a White House.
You have to let the reporters in.
The president is a big boy.
He doesn t have to answer questions if they re shouted at him, but they wouldn t let anyone in because of the other issue that is the president saying he believes his predecessor someone wire tapped him during last year s campaign.
Hopefully, all news media outlets do the same.Trump will undoubtedly be upset by this, but honestly too bad.
He needs to own what he s doing, answer questions about it, and be an actual leader.
Not the elusive dictator he s appearing to become more and more each day.Watch here:Featured Photo by Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images HT Raw Story
