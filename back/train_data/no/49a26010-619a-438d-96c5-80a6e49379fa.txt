washington ( reuters ) - north korea s ambassador to the united nations on friday ignored a u.s. call for a cessation of weapons testing to allow for talks with pyongyang on its nuclear program and said his country would not pose a threat to any state , as long as its interests were not infringed upon .
u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson earlier told a meeting of the u.n security council on pyongyang s nuclear and ballistic missile programs that a sustained cessation of north korea s threatening behavior was needed before talks could occur between washington and pyongyang .
north korea s u.n. ambassador , ja song nam , made no mention of tillerson s call in his speech to the session , which he called a desperate measure plotted by the u.s. being terrified by the incredible might of our republic that has successfully achieved the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force .
