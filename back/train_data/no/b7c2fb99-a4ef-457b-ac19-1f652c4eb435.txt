while jobs in the solar energy sector account for 39 percent of all world-wide energy employment ( while oil accounts for 50 percent ) , fortune magazine reports that for the first time in quite a while , there are more openings for solar jobs than oil.think about that .
while the world burns for the next barrel of oil , green energy jobs are outpacing the status quo dirty energy that pulled the united states into a massive war.as fortune finds : this [ trend ] corresponds with a recent report by the solar foundation that highlighted the rapid growth of the u.s. clean energy sector .
by the end of this year , the solar sector should have 240,000 workers under its wings , and currently employs around 77 % more workers than the coal mining industry.so why is this happening ?
well , since the price of oil has plunged by 60 percent in the last 18 months has caused the world s largest oil and gas companies to cut jobs at an alarming rate .
bp has announced it will cut 9 percent of its workforce while chevron says it will cut 10 percent.this comes as reports show that global investment in renewable energy , most of which has come from china and india , heavy polluters , was more than twice that of coal and gas combined from last year s numbers.tara sinclair , chief economist of indeed , issued a warning to those in the energy industry : see out renewable jobs , not oil.the decline in oil prices has not just rocked that industry , but jobs linked to both fossil fuels and renewable energy .
whether or not solar overtakes oil on indeed , energy workers would do well to position themselves for work in renewable fields such as solar , wind , and hydroelectricity.with clinton s pledge to build 600 million more solar fields and a promise to rebuild ravaged coal country with renewable energy , the amount of green workers could surge within the next several years ( should she win ) .is the country , and the world , moving towards a greener economy ?
hopefully , it does and will send a powerful and destructive industry packing.featured image via wikipedia
