a member of president trump s diversity council is threatening to quit because he opposes trump s cancelation of daca .
bye bye ! trump diversity council member tells @ acosta he may quit the council if trump moves ahead to end daca https : //t.co/ccn90egsdn cnn newsroom ( @ cnnnewsroom ) september 4 , 2017 i want to remind him and his team that from an economic standpoint , and again , we re business people if you look at this from a purely economic standpoint again , none of these young people gets government benefits of any sorts so they re not costing us anything .
they pay over $ 2 billion in taxes is anyone else out there sick of the american people being told illegals cost nothing ? daca will cost americans and their government a huge amount of money.on average , people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits .
people without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal , state and local tax officials.in 2013 , a heritage foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $ 6,300 billion over the next five decades .
that is roughly equivalent to $ 550,000 per illegal , or $ 10,000 per illegal per year , much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for social security and medicare .
that cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.if those 3 million daca people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens , then obama s daca will cost americans roughly $ 1,700 billion over the next 50 years , according to heritage foundation s numbers.moreover , the daca migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary americans , including urban youths and recent immigrants .
currently , americans lose roughly $ 500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies report.via : gp
