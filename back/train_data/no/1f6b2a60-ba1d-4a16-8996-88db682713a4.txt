paris ( reuters ) - france will make the armed soldiers patrolling its streets against jihadi attacks more mobile and their deployment less predictable but will not cut their numbers , ministers said on thursday .
some 10,000 soldiers , including 3,000 reservists , have been patrolling the streets of paris and other french cities since the islamic state attacks in early 2015 in what is known as operation sentinelle .
but although opinion polls show people are reassured by soldiers on show at home , military chiefs said the operation has overstretched the army , soldiers have become targets for militants and some critics see it as no more than a pr exercise .
there is no change in the size of the sentinelle force , defence minister florence parly said in a news conference .
what is changing , is the way we will organize these troops .
we have to become more unpredictable , she said .
soldiers will continue to patrol the most sensitive sites such as airports , stations and areas popular with tourists , and will intervene during specific sport or cultural events .
but other patrols will become more random and reactive , ministers said .
making the soldiers less static will reduce the risks of them becoming targets and improve troops morale , interior minister gerard collomb said .
in february last year , a french soldier who was part of operation sentinelle shot an egyptian man armed with machetes who attacked him near the entrance to the louvre museum shouting allahu akbar .
