mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico s top prosecutor for electoral crimes on friday said he would no longer fight his dismissal by the acting attorney general , ending a simmering dispute that had caused embarrassment to the government of president enrique pena nieto .
mexico s acting attorney general last week fired santiago nieto on the grounds that he broke a code of conduct for officials .
nieto s firing came just days after he spoke publicly about a graft investigation linked to the campaign of mexican president enrique pena nieto .
his summary dismissal stirred up a major row in congress that at one point threatened to impede the passage of legislation , but with the passing of a key budget bill late on thursday , there were signs the dispute was receding .
in a letter to the senate and a news conference , nieto said that he had become too polarizing a figure to keep working ahead of national elections next year .
however , he insisted he had broken no law and that he had been unfairly dismissed .
for all these reasons i have decided to withdraw my objection to ( my dismissal ) , he said in the letter .
nieto was fired after an interview with newspaper reforma in which he said emilio lozoya , the former boss of state oil firm pemex , wrote to him to ask that he be declared innocent of accusations he funneled cash from brazilian construction firm odebrecht into pena nieto s 2012 election campaign .
lozoya , who was a senior adviser to pena nieto in the campaign , denies the allegations about odebrecht .
the firm is at the heart of a bribery and kickback probe , known as lava jato or car wash , that has reverberated across latin america .
pena nieto has also denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to the 2012 campaign .
