Recently, a video post went viral on Facebook of a little girl crying when she found out that President Obama was no longer going to be her president.
In a span of 5 days, one grandmother s little Facebook page somehow managed to get more than 30,043 likes and 7,440 shares after people were touched by the girl s absolutely adorable emotional response.
Well, it turns out, one of those people was POTUS himself.Here is what the president had to say on Facebook after he saw the video: Caprina, tell her to dry her tears because I m not going anywhere.
Once I leave the White House, I ll still be a citizen just like her.
And when she grows up, she can get involved right alongside me.
In the meantime, I ll keep an eye out for her letter, and we ll always get to celebrate our birthdays together!

This is the definition of class.
And it s just one more reason why we re going to miss POTUS when he s gone.Pic via Facebook.Unfortunately, there is such a thing as term limits, and while it may not exactly be the most democratic thing we do here in the United States, it s put in place to give other would-be leaders the chance to step up and fill his shoes.
It s the same reason we got a chance to elect Obama into office in the first place, and that s a good thing.Yes, Obama will surely be missed.
Even though he still has a remaining 11 months or so left in office, you can be sure a lot more tears will be following once the reality of his departure fully sets in.
Way to keep it classy, POTUS!Pic via Twitter.Featured image via White House.
