crooked hillary has always been crooked .
she s just been better than anyone america s ever seen at not getting caught on september 5 , 2006 , eli chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the jewish press , and hillary clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a u.s. senator .
her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the jewish press.the tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of jewish press staffers in the room .
according to chomsky , his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006 , until today when he played it for the observer.the tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant , such as analysis of the re-election battle that sen. joe lieberman was then facing in connecticut .
but a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the palestinian authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by clinton s republican opponent donald trump that the current election is rigged .
speaking to the jewish press about the january 25 , 2006 , election for the second palestinian legislative council ( the legislature of the palestinian national authority ) , clinton weighed in about the result , which was a resounding victory for hamas ( 74 seats ) over the u.s.-preferred fatah ( 45 seats ) .
i do not think we should have pushed for an election in the palestinian territories .
i think that was a big mistake , said sen. clinton .
and if we were going to push for an election , then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win .
chomsky recalls being taken aback that anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader , no less that the u.s. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections .
some eyebrows were also raised when then-senator clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.for entire story : observer
