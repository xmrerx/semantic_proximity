i remember a conversation i had with mr. putin four or five years ago where i told him that was a mistake he did not take my warnings and as a consequence things have gotten worse , he said.obama said historically , russia provided a lot of financial support to assad and sold syria weapons , even as the dictator continued to alienate his regime from the people .
the bad news is that russia continues to believe that assad , who is their traditional partner , is somebody that is worthy of continuing support , obama said.obama acknowledged that putin was now sending more military advisers to assad as well as more military equipment .
the strategy that they re pursuing now by doubling down with assad , i think is a big mistake , he said .
you can t continue to double down on a strategy that is doomed to failure .
obama said that the united states would continue talking with russia to convince them that their actions were bad for syria .
he signaled that diplomacy was the primary vehicle for restoring order in syria , encouraging the russians to get a little smarter .
they are threatened in may ways more than we are by isil .
