seoul ( reuters ) - south korea s president moon jae-in said on thursday a missile launched this week by north korea was the most advanced of pyongyang s arsenal , but said that the isolated state still needed to prove some technical details .
moon made the remarks during a phone call with u.s. president donald trump , saying it was unclear whether the north actually had the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and that it still needed to prove other things , such as its re-entry technology .
earlier , the united states warned north korea s leadership it would be utterly destroyed if war were to break out , after pyongyang test-fired its most advanced missile , putting the u.s. mainland within range , in violation of u.n. security council resolutions .
