BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition told Reuters on Friday that it does not have any releasable information concerning the whereabouts of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
A military media unit run by the Iran-backed Hezbollah said on Friday that Baghdadi was reported present in the Syrian town of Albu Kamal during the Syrian army and its allies operation to clear it.
The report did not say if Baghdadi was captured.
