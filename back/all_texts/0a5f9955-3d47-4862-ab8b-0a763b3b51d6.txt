re buke r byo ok/ verb 1. express sharp disapproval or criticism of (someone) because of their behavior or actions.Obama s sharp disapproval of ISIS will have them shaking in their evil boots Very powerful!By now, most of America would rather have a hot poker in the eye than be forced to hear the sound of Barry s incompetent voice, but you just have to listen to this arrogant a*s to believe he actually said this re buke r byo ok/ verb 1. express sharp disapproval or criticism of (someone) because of their behavior or actions.In a joint press conference with France s President Hollande on Tuesday, President Obama took a cue from Brian Williams and focused on the powerful message that we are sending terrorists by not cancelling the climate conference in Paris.Imagine the cold chill wind that in that moment crawled up the spine of every ISIS terrorist with a TV and possibly an aerosol spray can.

Stirring.One should keep in mind, this is the same climate conference which is featuring Prince Charles as a keynote speaker.
Yes, Prince Charles, who says the conflict in Syria is the fault of climate change.So .. we ll be rebuking terror by focusing on the real threat of climate change and featuring a speaker who blames the battle with ISIS on the weather rather than the terror.Rebuke.
