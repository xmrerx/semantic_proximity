With more and more coming out about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, it s become abundantly clear that he in no way should be allowed near the Oval Office.Between his racism, sexism, Islamophobia, insulting disabled people as well as Gold Star families, and now the leaked Access Hollywood footage which is leading to women everywhere to reveal they ve been sexually assaulted by Trump, he s not fit to lead anything.Appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers Vice President Joe Biden laid it all out on the table and told Seth, as well as the world, why Donald Trump isn t fit to lead as well as how absolutely horrible he is to women.Biden said: First of all, what I found astounding, is that he would so publicly, no matter who he was talking to, that he would acknowledge that he engaged in the textbook definition of sexual assault.
He didn t say, you know, I go up and I ask if, I just go up and grab and I can do this and then I see in the paper today, one of the pageants, I guess Miss Teen America, the teen girls, I guess three, four, five in a room, they were getting dressed, they were naked, he walked in and said don t worry girls, I ve seen all this he stood there.
I mean, this is absolutely outrageous behavior.
Biden then drives the point home: I ve spent most of my career trying to figure out how to begin to change the culture in this country that we treat women with respect and with dignity.
And Biden truly has with his It s On Us campaign which is leading the effort to combat sexual assault nationwide.What Donald Trump has done to women isn t only outrageous, it s illegal.
Unwanted sexual advances is the definition of sexual assault, and Trump needs to be held accountable for his actions.Watch the video here: He engaged in the textbook definition of sexual assault A stunned Joe Biden on the Trump tape: pic.twitter.com/O9u6rP3AsH Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 13, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
