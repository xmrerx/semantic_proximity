beirut ( reuters ) - a prominent syrian opposition leader said on thursday u.n. mediation to end the country s six-year conflict has failed and the revolution would continue .
riyad hijab , chairman of the saudi-backed high negotiations committee ( hnc ) , rejected comments by u.n. special envoy staffan de mistura that president bashar al-assad s opponents must accept they have not won the war .
de mistura s statements reflect the defeat of u.n. mediation , hijab wrote on twitter .
the syrian revolution continues , he said .
de mistura had repeatedly made un-studied remarks on the conflict , he said .
hijab , a former syrian prime minister under assad , called for a new a u.n. approach on the syrian issue , without elaborating .
assad has won a series of military victories but rebel groups still hold large parts of the northwest of the country and substantial enclaves in the southwest , in homs province and near damascus .
de mistura said on wednesday the opposition must be unified and realistic in accepting it had not won the war .
he did not say assad was victorious .
victory can only be if there is a sustainable political long-term solution , de mistura said , suggesting the conflict was almost over because many countries were involved principally to defeat islamic state and a national ceasefire should follow .
the remarks come ahead of a round of syria talks between damascus allies russia and iran and opposition backer turkey in astana next week .
several rounds of negotiations in astana and a separate u.n.-sponsored track in geneva between the government and the hnc have produced no visible progress on ending the war that broke out after a popular uprising in 2011 .
russia and iran have stood by assad .
some western countries have softened their initial stance that he should leave power immediately , saying he could be part of a transitional period .
