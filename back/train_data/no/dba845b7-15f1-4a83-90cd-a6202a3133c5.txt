beirut ( reuters ) - the u.s.-led coalition on tuesday denied striking deir al-zor city in eastern syria after damascus accused its jets of killing more than a dozen people .
syrian state television had said the u.s.-led coalition hit the government-held qusur district , killing 14 civilians and wounding 32 , on monday .
the british-based syrian observatory for human rights said it was unclear which aircraft carried out the raid , but that it killed at least 22 people .
colonel ryan dillon , a spokesman for the u.s.-led coalition against islamic state , said on tuesday that its jets had not conducted air strikes on any part of the eastern city .
the coalition says it investigates any such allegations and is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in syria and neighboring iraq .
the syrian army controls much of deir al-zor city , after pushing into it last month with the help of russian air strikes and iran-backed militias .
that advance broke an islamic state siege of an enclave there which had lasted nearly three years .
syrian troops and allied forces are now fighting islamic state militants in a few remaining districts of the city , and in nearby parts of deir al-zor province .
the u.s.-led coalition has been striking islamic state targets to back an alliance of kurdish and arab militias in other parts of the province across the euphrates river .
the united states and russia have said they communicate with each other to prevent possible points of conflict between the two separate offensives .
