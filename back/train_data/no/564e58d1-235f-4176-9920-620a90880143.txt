istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish police have detained 54 staff from a university shut down after an attempted coup last year that was blamed on u.s.-based islamic preacher fethullah gulen , state-run anadolu news agency said on wednesday .
it said the police had arrest warrants for a total of 171 academics and staff from istanbul s former fatih university , which was regarded as having close ties to gulen .
the cleric has denied any involvement in the failed putsch of july 15 , 2016 .
fatih university was shut under a state decree following the coup attempt and anadolu said staff there were found to have been users of bylock , an encrypted messaging application which the government says was commonly used by gulen s supporters .
since the coup attempt more than 50,000 people , including civil servants and security personnel , have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs .
rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent .
the government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which has turkey faced since the putsch , in which 250 people were killed .
