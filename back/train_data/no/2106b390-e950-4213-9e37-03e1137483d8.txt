moscow ( reuters ) - general valery gerasimov , the chief of russia s general staff , spent an hour on the phone with u.s. marine general joseph dunford discussing pentagon allegations that moscow bombed u.s.-backed fighters in syria , the kommersant daily said on sunday .
u.s.-backed militias said they came under attack on saturday from russian jets and syrian government forces in deir al-zor province , a flashpoint in an increasingly complex battlefield .
the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias fighting with the u.s.-led coalition , said six of its fighters were wounded in the strike .
russia s defence ministry on sunday rejected the allegations , saying its planes only targeted islamic state militants and that it had warned the united states well in advance of its operational plans .
kommersant , citing unnamed military sources , reported that gerasimov and dunford , chairman of the u.s. military s joint chiefs of staff , had spent an hour on saturday discussing the allegations by phone .
it said moscow routinely gave the united states at least two hours warning of any strikes in syria and then shared information afterwards about which targets had been struck .
