[ 0225 edt ] - if republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the senate , they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority , not senseless 60 ... [ 0946 edt ] - ... even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51 , some really good things need 60 .
so many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes .... [ 1000 edt ] -- source link : ( bit.ly/2jbh4lu ) ( bit.ly/2jpexyr )
