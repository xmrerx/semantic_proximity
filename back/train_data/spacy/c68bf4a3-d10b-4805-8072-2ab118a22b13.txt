part 1an excellent easy understand piece truth surround phony climate cool warm changethe pollution result rapid uncontrolled postwar industrial expansion spawn two environmentalist movement
one group primarily compose physical scientist engineer set directly address pollution problem develop facility legislative control date virtually eliminate industrial contamination soil water aira second group primarily compose activist little physical science background nothing protest industry without ever address single environmental problem -PRON- create solutionwhile physical scientist engineer work quietly industry solve environmental problem ideology drive environmentalist activist use dramatic alarmist rhetoric gain media control become dominant political force capable force -PRON- selfserving ideology general public impunitythe earth enter cool phase 1942 1970 environmentalist find way blame cool industrial expansion
concept particulate matter fossil fuel usage block energy sun give cool effect
concept incorporate parameter crude climate model time prediction model run james hansen 1971 project fifty year cool increase use fossil fuelsonly four year later spite continue increase fossil fuel usage global cooling come end prove model proper physical basis relate fossil fuel usage global coolingby 1988 13 year global warming ideological environmentalist develop new tact blame fossil fuel
british government embark political campaign promote -PRON- nuclear industry attack powerful coal union create alarmist scenario runaway global warming result co2 produce coal fossil fuel
entirely political nature absolutely scientific backing -PRON- make perfect weapon environmentalist promote -PRON- anti energy anti humanity ideology
need scientific justificationa 1971 climate model far sophisticated provide science backing
instead blame fossil fuel block incoming solar radiation model remove parameter replace -PRON- newly contrive parameter relate global warming effect fossil fuel source co2 outgoing thermal radiation earththis model also produce james hansen project warm next century fossil fuel co2 emission increase continue accelerate rate
1971 model 1988 model prove false global warming end 1998 even co2 emission continue rise unprecedented rate
make matter bad since 2002 earth cool make projection clearly wrong directionby even basic standard ethical science model first predict cool fossil fuel usage discredit four year later warm occur increase usage predict warm fossil fuel usage discredit ten year later cool reoccur increase usage would declare absolutely invalid ideology involve science protocol totally abandonedimpact 2009as result alarmist prediction 1988 climate model hansen intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc form auspex united nations
