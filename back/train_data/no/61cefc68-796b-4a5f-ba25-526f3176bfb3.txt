( ( refiles december 15 story to clarify areas of control in shabwa , marib in paragraph 3 ) ) aden ( reuters ) - the yemeni army and allied fighters on friday drove houthi militants from a town that was one of the last positions they held in the country s south , military sources and local officials said .
the forces advanced into bayhan , about 300 km ( 190 miles ) southeast of the houthi-held capital sanaa , killing dozens of the militants in clashes , the sources said .
bayhan is important in yemen s war because it is located on a major road linking shabwa province with marib province , part of which is held by the houthis , to the north .
the army s advance means that the houthis have been expelled from most of shabwa , sources said .
yemen s more than two-year-old war pits the iran-allied houthis , who control sanaa , against a saudi-led military alliance that backs the government now based in the southern port of aden .
the conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis .
the government-run sabanew agency said the remaining houthis had fled after battles for strategic positions in the bayhan area which had left hundreds of them dead and wounded .
the agency said the army also seized other positions in the area , where the movement of heavy artillery had been difficult because of sand dunes .
this month the saudi-led coalition , which is backed by u.s. and british weapons and intelligence , intensified air strikes after the houthis killed former president ali abdullah saleh when he switched sides in the civil war .
there has been relatively little change in positions on the ground around the capital .
