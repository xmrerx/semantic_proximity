kabul ( reuters ) - at least 11 afghan civilians were killed and 16 wounded on wednesday when a nato helicopter attacked a house where taliban insurgents had taken shelter in logar province , east of the capital , kabul , the local governor said .
there was no immediate confirmation that nato or u.s. aircraft were involved , but a spokesman for resolute support , the nato-led mission in kabul , said in an emailed statement it was aware of the reports and was looking into them .
logar governor halim fedaee said the incident occurred in dashte bari district near the provincial capital pul-e alam .
the taliban took position in a civilian house and fired a rocket at a nato helicopter , the governor said .
the house owner begged the taliban to leave , but they didn t. the helicopter took a turn , came and hit this house that caused these deaths .
the incident , a day after reports that an afghan air strike killed at least 13 civilians in the western province of herat , underlines the risk that a recent increase in air raids by u.s. and afghan forces will increase civilian casualties .
united nations figures showed a 43 percent spike in civilian casualties from both afghan and u.s. air strikes in the first half of the year , with 95 killed and 137 wounded , as the pace of air operations has increased .
civilian casualties caused by u.s. air strikes have long been a source of friction in afghanistan , and the risk of further casualties may increase if the u.s. steps up operations as part of president donald trump s new strategy for afghanistan .
earlier , resolute support denied a taliban statement that a u.s. helicopter had been shot down in logar province .
it said a helicopter had made a precautionary landing for a maintenance issue .
