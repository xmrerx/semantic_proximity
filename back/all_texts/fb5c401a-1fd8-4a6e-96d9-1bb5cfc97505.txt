North Carolina, long seen as the one state in the southeast with a bit of progressive common sense, is now nothing more than a complete embarrassment.
They have passed a law in response to Charlotte s city ordinance protecting LGBT people that completely forbids cities, towns, and counties within the the state from putting any protections whatsoever in place for LGBT people.
Of course, the internet exploded when Gov.
Pat McCrory signed the hateful bill into law, giving rise to the hashtag #WeAreNotThis.Of course, most of the fear mongering came due to the so-called bathroom bill part of the protection ordinance, which would allow transgender people to used the public facilities that match their gender identity.
The bigots insisted that men would be using the bathroom to spy on women and all kinds of other nonsense.
A brave transgender man on twitter quickly shot down the absurdity of people who object to trans people in restrooms, though:@PatMcCroryNC It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife.

Pat McCrory and his fellow bigots in the legislature:You can sugar coat it all you want to but you just signed a hate bill.
You should be ashamed.

Nope.
Transparency?
Nope.
Freedom?
Nope.
@NCGOP power grab today is just plain bullying.
#WeAreNotThis Andrew Perrin (@AndrewJPerrin) March 23, 2016We should have seen a bathroom bill coming since the @NCGOP has been flushing our good state down the toilet.

Repealing 50 years non discriminatory efforts in one swoop, and people STILL want to vote Republican?

@PatMcCroryNC tells me & all LGBTQ+ Tar Heels he does not care to be our Governor.
Come Nov, VOTE to ensure he won't be #WeAreNotThis #HB2 Alex Hayden DiLalla (@AlexDiLalla) March 24, 2016I'm so ashamed that the state I am literally within a few hundred feet of just legalized discrimination.
So shameful.
#WeAreNotThis #HB2 Kenan (@kenan917) March 24, 2016In NC I need 1000% more protection from a gun in a bathroom than a transgender person.

This North Carolina law is misguided & wrong.
#WeAreNotThis pic.twitter.com/3yCayn7Tum Google (@google) March 24, 2016North Carolina GOP and Gov.
Pat McCrory, this law is terrible.
Didn t you learn anything from what Indiana Gov.
Mike Pence went through last summer with his equally bigoted Religious Freedom Restoration Act?
You re reaping what you sow here.
We will continue to fight back against your bigotry.
As someone who lives 25 minutes from Charlotte, North Carolina, in the equally bigoted state of South Carolina, let me tell you we will not stand for this.
You re on the wrong side of history.
Your bigotry will not be tolerated.Featured image via screen capture from Equality NC Twitter
