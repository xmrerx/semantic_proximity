early voting has begun in the battleground state of north carolina , and after months of contentious litigation , it s clear why republicans wanted to squash it : returns are showing democrats with an eight point advantage over republicans.data analysis from targetsmart ( who partnered with nbc news ) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast , 42 percent come from registered democrats , 34 percent from republicans , 25 percent from unaffiliated , and 1 percent from libertarians.contrast that to 2012 , when mitt romney won north carolina by two percent : in early voting that year in that state , republicans held a five percent lead .
now democrats hold an eight percent lead .
in 2008 , when president obama won ( by a slim margin of 0.33 percent ) , democrats had an 11 point advantage .
in 2004 , democrats had an 11 point advantage , but kerry lost to bush by 13 percent.so while it s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins , the last two elections ( in which early voting has increased tremendously ) shows that is the case.nate silver s fivethirtyeight currently gives clinton a 43 percent chance of winning north carolina ( and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall ) .
clinton s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week , with one reason being a strong showing for democrats in early voting .
the new york times election model gives clinton a 48 percent chance of winning north carolina.again , no wonder governor pat mccory , who is currently losing his re-election bid , and the gop legislature wanted to do away with it .
when democrats get a head start , that usually means good news in november.democrats shouldn t get too comfortable .
although early voting points to a democratic-leaning result , republicans could very well ( and chances are great ) benefit from in person voting on november 8 .
president obama never overcame romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election , almost all the polls for the month of september favored obama.with 45 days left until the election , anything can happen , so democrats need to continue to mobilize , register , and get out the vote for not just early ballots , but for november 8.rachel maddow broke down the facts on her show : featured image via justin sullivan/getty images
