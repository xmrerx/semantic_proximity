Recently, Michelle Obama posed for InStyle magazine.
The First Lady was stunning in a custom-made teal dress by Brandon Maxwell but of course conservatives had to sh*t all over it.A ridiculously named yet somehow moderately popular right-wing garbage fire of a Facebook page called The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense decided to give their take on the matter, posting the photo of our lovely First Lady with the following message: What do you think of the new portrait of Moochelle by InStyle Magazine?
The numbskulls who visit the page are then instructed to like if they think it is Photoshopped and share the post if they are still not convinced he s a she.
Naturally, the denizens of Stupidville flocked to the opportunity, calling her every name they can think of and, thanks to the power of stupidity and a third grade education, even managing to accidentally make some up in their pursuit to out-stupid one another.
Many, of course, leaped at the opportunity to fantasize about the First Lady being a man, with some even demanding to see her penis.
Others stuck to the tried-and-true let s just call her a monkey or ape and get it over with.
The modern conservative, folks.It s important to remember that each and every one of these vapid f*cksticks will be voting in November.Make sure you re there to vote BLUE because you know these idiots are voting for Trump.Featured image via screengrab
