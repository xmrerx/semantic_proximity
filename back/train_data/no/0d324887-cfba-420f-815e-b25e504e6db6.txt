cairo ( reuters ) - an egyptian lawmaker is introducing a draft bill that would imprison those engaging in or promoting same-sex relations , a copy of the draft seen by reuters on thursday showed .
amnesty international said the bill is another nail in the coffin for sexual rights in egypt and should be scrapped .
it would introduce sentences of to up to 10 years in prison for people engaging in or promoting same-sex relations .
the law is part of a wider crackdown against homosexuality that started in september when a group of people were seen raising a rainbow flag at a concert , a rare public show of support for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights in the conservative muslim country .
if passed , this law would further entrench stigma and abuse against people based on their perceived sexual orientation , said najia bounaim , north africa campaigns director at amnesty international .
the egyptian authorities must urgently scrap this draft law and put an end to this alarming wave of homophobic persecution , bounaim added .
the crackdown comes as egypt , a main western ally in the middle east , is under fire for its human rights record and the united states has withheld some of its $ 1.3 billion in annual military aid .
at least 70 people have been arrested and some have been subjected to anal examinations that amount to torture since september .
homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in egypt but discrimination is rife .
gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery , immorality or blasphemy .
egyptian authorities do not deny going after gays .
gay men and rights activists say the lgbt community has been facing an aggressive crackdown since 2013 , when president abdel fattah al-sisi as military chief ousted president mohamed mursi , an islamist .
