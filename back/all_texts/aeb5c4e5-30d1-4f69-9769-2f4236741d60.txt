A shameless promotion of amnesty by our Feds.
Obama and the Democrats are willing to do whatever it takes It s all about the votes The Obama administration is encouraging the 8.8 million eligible lawful permanent residents to become U.S. citizen with efforts aimed at raising awareness about the process and pressing more immigrants to naturalize.Just for fun the Obama regime threw in this silly little reminder (see end of tweet where VOTE is prominently displayed in upper case letters.
This tweet (featured in the Spanish speaking video) basically serves as a reminder: If you gain your citizenship through our efforts, you must vote to keep the Democrats (who were willing to sell out their nation) in office Monday, U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services the agency responsible for overseeing immigration to the U.S. is out with a video composed of a compilation of six word entries via social media from citizens of any country, living anywhere about what U.S. citizenship means to them.
Back in September, we asked you to share what U.S. citizenship means to you in six words using the hashtag: #citizenship6.
You responded in ways that touched us, challenged us and showed us that one word has so many meanings, the agency explained.The agency released two versions of the video one in English and one in Spanish.
We also created banners for our home page that we ll post over the coming months.
Enjoy the video, and please share it with your friends and family!
the agency added.In order to naturalize most applicants must demonstrate they can understand, read, write, and speak basic English.
