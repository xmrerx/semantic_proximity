london ( reuters ) - brexit minister david davis said on tuesday he believed britain would agree some kind of basic deal with the european union , even in the very improbable eventuality that they fail to agree a trade deal .
davis told a parliamentary committee that even if britain failed to strike a formal trade deal both sides were likely to have agreements in areas such as aviation that would allow planes to fly between britain and the eu .
it is not impossible , but very , very improbable that britain and the eu will fail to agree a brexit deal , davis told the lawmakers .
whatever happens we will have a basic deal without the bits we really want , he said .
