There have been two black men, one in Louisiana, one in Minnesota, killed by cops in as many days.
This is a pattern, and an extremely disturbing one.
A lot of it is racism, but many white people don t want to believe that.
They do not want to believe that white privilege is a thing, and being black literally means living under the daily threat of violence not from criminals, but from cops, from the people who are supposed to serve and protect us.
That is the last thing they do, though.However, the thing is this: not all cops are like this.
There are many black police officers who are disturbed by the videos of the shootings and one of them is speaking out.
Nakia Jones is a black police officer in a predominantly black neighborhood, and she was so disturbed by the video of Alton Sterling being murdered by cops in Baton Rouge, Louisiana that she recorded a passionate, emotional video.
She watched the video, quote, over and over and over and over again, to make sure she wasn t viewing it through just the lens of a police officer, or that of a black woman.
She looked objectively and was horrified by what she saw.
Nakia Jones spoke to both racist cops who murder black men with impunity, and to the black community, in how to change, and of why she took the oath to serve and protect in the first place.Officer Jones shamed racist cops, as they should be shamed, and a system that could just as easily murder her own sons in the same way so many black men have been murdered by police.
The video is powerful, beautiful, and heart-wrenching all at the same time.
There are too many wonderful quotes therein to begin to put them all in one article.
The best way to portray her is to simply watch.Without further ado, here is the most powerful video I ve seen on this subject matter yet:Featured image via video screen capture
