21st century wire asks currently throughout the western media exists a major public relations push to raise the profile of supposed ngo in syria known as the white helmets in advance of the upcoming nobel peace prize award on oct 7th in oslo , norway .
recently , streaming giant netflix released a documentary film to much fanfare , about this alleged first responder group in syria called the white helmets .
they produce many of the emotional images seen on western media about the syrian conflict , and also claim to have saved 60,000 lives from assad s bombs since 2013 .
what many people are not aware of , however , is that this group has been financed by nato member states to the tune of at $ 60 million so far , and they are embedded exclusively in terrorist-held areas of syria .
all things considered , do they qualified for a nobel prize ? have your shout !
