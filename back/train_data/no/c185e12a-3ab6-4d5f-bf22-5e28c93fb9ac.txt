i think we need somebody who knows the military .
i think he ( rick perry ) knows the military i find it difficult to want a commander in chief who has no experience being in the trenches , whatsoever i like somebody who answers to a higher power so it s not just all about them all the time .
that they truly are going to a higher power to see what they can do what i believe in is electing a leader who has a strong moral compass , who cares about people and not just himself and his own agenda .
and who is humble and good economically .
