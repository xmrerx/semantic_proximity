What an evil bunch of freaks!
The agenda is so important to them that they can t see the forest for the trees.
Overpopulation is a problem in itself but connecting it to the scam that is global warming is just crazy.
These people have such a twisted view of everything that it s really scary.
I m 100% FED Up!
with the UN climate freaks and their agenda.Climate One founder Greg Dalton and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Christiana Figueres, held a discussion in 2013 on the role of women in fighting Global Warming.During the interview Secretary Figueres stated, We should make every effort, to reduce the world s population in an effort to fight Climate Change:DALTON: A related issue is fertility rates in population.
A lot of people in energy and environmental circles don t wanna go near that because it s politically charged.
It s not their issue.
But isn t it true that stopping the rise of the population would be one of the biggest levers and driving the rise of green house gases?FIGUERES: I mean we all know that we expect nine billion, right, by 2050.
So, yes, obviously less people would exert less pressure on the natural resources.DALTON: So is nine billion a forgone conclusion?
That s like baked in, done, no way to change that?HERE S THE VIDEO-IF YOU WANT TO SKIP THE BS THEN JUST GO TO THE 4:20 MARK: A LITTLE MORE ON CHRISTIANA FIGUERES-THE 70 S CALLED AND THEY WANT THEIR RADICAL HIPPIE BACK!
AT THE 2:40 MARK SHE SAYS WE NEED A TRANSFORMATION (SOUND FAMILIAR) AND A REVOLUTION TO CHANGE OUR WAY OF LIFE: FIGUERES: Well there again, there is pressure in the system to go toward that; we can definitely change those, right?
We can definitely change those numbers and really should make every effort to change those numbers because we are already, today, already exceeding the planet s planetary carrying capacity, today.
To say nothing of adding more population that is really going to overextend our capacity.
So yes we should do everything possible.
But we cannot fall into the very simplistic opinion of saying just by curtailing population then we ve solved the problem.
It is not either/or, it is an and/also.Via: Progressives Today
