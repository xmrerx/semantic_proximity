abc political hack martha raddatz tried to bait homeland security adviser thomas bossert when she played the cnn wwe video and commented that it seems like a threat .
bossert didn t take the bait but praised president trump for standing up to the media .
great job ! new : homeland security adviser thomas bossert on trump s cnn tweet : no one would perceive that as a threat .
i hope they don t. # thisweek pic.twitter.com/bfrwwt7bum this week ( @ thisweekabc ) july 2 , 2017the dhs adviser responded : no one would perceive that as a threat .
i hope they don t. i do think that he s beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to.he went on to praise president trump : the most genuine president and the most non-politician president we ve seen in my lifetime .
there s a lot of cable new shows that reach directly into hundreds of thousands of viewers and they re really not all very fair to the president .
so i m pretty proud of the president for developing a twitter and a social media platform where he can talk directly to the american people .
