meanwhile , the obama s jet off to hawaii every year well before christmas .
when you read the reason why the bush s wait in dc until after christmas day , you ll see why its really all about putting others before yourself like many americans , u.s. presidents often take time off around the holidays.however , according to journalist joseph curl , who previously covered the white house , former president george w. bush went on christmas vacation in a way that stands in direct contrast to president barack obama .
[ h ] ere s the thing : in december , we never left washington , d.c. , until the day after christmas .
never .
mr. bush and his wife , laura , would always depart the white house a few days before the holiday and hunker down at camp david , the presidential retreat in maryland , curl wrote in a 2013 column that was republished thursday.after a few years , curiosity finally got to the former washington times reporter and he asked a low-level administration official why .
i still remember what she said , curl wrote .
so all of us can be with our families on christmas .
who was us ?
hundreds and hundreds of people , that s who .
sure , the reporters who covered the president , but also dozens and dozens on his staff , 100 secret service agents , maybe more , and all of those city cops required whenever the president s on the move in d.c. , curl added in his column.however , things seemingly changed when obama took office .
[ t ] his president would never delay his trip to his island getaway .
he s off every year well before christmas .
hundreds and hundreds head off with him , leaving family behind , curl wrote .
no christmas at home , he added .
instead , the hawaiian village waikiki beach resort .
nice , but not exactly home .
