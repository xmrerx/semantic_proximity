nice threat to potus : the intelligence community will continue to convey truth to power even if power doesn t necessarily listen .
this entire video is disturbing but eye opening .
they feel threatened by trump and this is clearly an effort to hurt president trump .
this coming from two men who ok d spying on americans and who lied under oath : how convenient that cnn s wolf blitzer is the host for this bashfest of the current administration under president trump .
how ironic is it that two men who lied under oath are speaking truth to power fyi : john brennan literally voted for the communist party in the 1970s during the height of the cold war now they re lecturing us about russia.these two men define the deep state this talk was really all about creating doubt on trump and to defend themselves post obama .
can you imagine if the tables were turned and this vitriol was directed at obama ?
shameful ! all you have to do is listen to clapper lie before congress and you know he has zero credibility to speak : remember the famous moment when us national intelligence chief james clapper was testifying about the nsa surveillance of americans when he let slip a sign he was not being truthful .
of course , we knew this was all a smoke and mirrors show .
clapper later said he misspoke last we checked it s pretty much the same thing as lying not wittingly james clapperhere s the video below where he parses words in his testimony : remember what clapper said recently about trump : former director of national intelligence james clapper says the united states political institutions are currently under assault both externally and internally , in the wake of president donald trump s firing of ex-fbi director james comey .
the developments of the past week are very bothersome , very disturbing to me , clapper said on cnn s state of the union on sunday .
i think in many ways our institutions are under assault , both externally and that s the big news here , the russian interference in our election system and i think as well , our institutions are under assault internally , when asked if he meant if those institutions were under assault internally by the president himself , clapper said exactly and added that he believed trump was undermining the checks and balances inherent to the u.s. political system .
