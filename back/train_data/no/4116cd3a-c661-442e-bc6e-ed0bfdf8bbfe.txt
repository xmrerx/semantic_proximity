hillary wouldn t see the prince via regular channels but once he donated the money she met with him ! newly released department of state documents reveal that the crown prince of bahrain was given an audience with then-secretary of state hillary clinton after he donated $ 32 million to her foundation.the documents , released monday by judicial watch , included emails between clinton foundation executive doug band and former clinton state department aide huma abedin , which appear to show that abedin acted as a middleman between clinton and her foundation s donors.band and abedin s email exchanges show that bahrain s crown prince salman had to go through the clinton foundation in order to set up a meeting with clinton after the former secretary of state declined to meet after official requests were made .
the first email , dated june 23 , 2009 , shows band interceding on behalf of the crown prince , noting he is a good friend of ours .
abedin replied that same day noting that salman had asked to see clinton through normal channels , but it appears clinton was not interested .
a later email , dated june 25 , 2009 , from abedin to band offers salman a 10 a.m. meeting with clinton .
