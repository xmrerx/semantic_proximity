the deputy attorney general rod rosenstein testified today about the clear cases of corruption and political bias in our intel agencies .
changing hillary s charge from grossly negligent to extremely careless is disturbing enough but it s clear that jim jordan knows this goes much deeper .
hillary was protected by the political hacks in the intel agencies but a target was put on president trump s back using the fisa court to open up spying on the him and those around him using a doctored up opposition research document that was never proven to be anywhere close to true the questioning from jordan is well worth watching : jim jordan just spoke with lou dobbs : .
@ jim_jordan on peter strzok : `` in case the american people , in his mind , are crazy enough to elect donald trump we need something else to stop trump .
that 's what this guy was thinking at the highest levels at the fbi . ''

clearly indicates professional duties infected by political viewpoints , which is disqualifying .
i was going on the published accounts i 'd seen , which did n't include this one .
should follow my own advice to wait til all facts in .
