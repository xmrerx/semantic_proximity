LONDON (Reuters) - British aid minister Priti Patel resigned on Wednesday, saying her actions had fallen below the high standards that are expected of her position when she failed to disclose meetings with Israeli officials during a holiday.
After meeting Theresa May, the prime minister s office released Patel s resignation letter in which she apologized for causing a distraction from the work of government.
May responded in a letter to say she believed Patel s decision was right .
