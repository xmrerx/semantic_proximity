21st century wire says how seriously can we take a secret cia assessment that russian intervention in the u.s. presidential election played a role in the victory of president elect donald j. trump when it comes from an organization that has intervened extensively in so many countries sovereign governments ? the anti-media the daily sheepleaccording to a secret cia assessment , russia intervened in the u.s. election to undermine confidence in the electoral system and boost support for donald trump.the president-elect has already rejected this notion , though the implications of claims regarding russian involvement are still unclear.once again , this kind of pro-clinton/anti-russian-based narrative has already been completely debunked .
for example , in his recent article , anonymous leaks to the washpost about the cia s russia beliefs are no substitute for evidence , glenn greenwald brilliantly explains why this story does not merit our attention .
he astutely notes : there is still no such evidence for any of these claims .
what we have instead are assertions , disseminated by anonymous people , completely unaccompanied by any evidence , let alone proof .
as a result , none of the purported evidence still can be publicly seen , reviewed , or discussed .
anonymous claims leaked to newspapers about what the cia believes do not constitute proof , and certainly do not constitute reliable evidence that substitutes for actual evidence that can be reviewed .
