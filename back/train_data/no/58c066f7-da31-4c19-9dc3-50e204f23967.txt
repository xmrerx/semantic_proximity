bamako ( reuters ) - a french military strike on armed militants in northern mali last month inadvertently killed malian soldiers who were being held hostage by the islamist group , the west african nation s defence ministry said on monday .
the french army has previously said that 15 members of the islamist militant group ansar dine were taken out of action in the oct. 23 operation in the abeibara region , which involved mirage jets , attack helicopters and ground forces .
in the week following the raid however , malian media reported that 11 soldiers had also been killed .
french and malian military and government officials initially declined to comment on the deaths .
in a statement dated oct. 31 but only distributed on monday , the defence ministry said that malian soldiers , detained by the terrorists , died in the attack without giving a death toll .
it was not immediately clear why the distribution of the statement , which was drafted following a meeting between the defense minister , france s ambassador to mali and a french military official , appeared to have been delayed .
paris has maintained that military intelligence had identified the site as a militant camp and french army spokesman colonel patrik steiger declined to comment on the malian statement .
work is under way with the malian authorities to determine the identities of individuals killed .
it s up to mali , a sovereign country , to communicate on this subject , not the french forces , he said .
france intervened in 2013 against islamist militants that seized northern mali a year earlier .
around 4,000 of its troops remain in west africa s sahel region as part of operation barkhane , a cross-border anti-terrorism operation .
