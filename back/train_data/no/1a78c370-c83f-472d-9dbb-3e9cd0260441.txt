albany , new york ( reuters ) - a new york judge on monday dismissed a challenge to canadian-born ted cruz ’ s eligibility to run in the state ’ s republican presidential primary election next month , saying the challengers had missed a key deadline for filing .
two new york residents , barry korman , 81 , of manhattan and william gallo , 85 , of manhasset , long island , on feb. 19 filed the petition to block cruz , a u.s. senator from texas , from getting onto the april 19 ballot , saying his birth in the canadian province of alberta makes him ineligible to be president .
state law requires that a petition challenging eligibility be filed within three days of when a candidate files to be placed on the ballot .
korman and gallo filed their petition more than two weeks after cruz filed his paperwork to get on the ballot , the judge said .
weinstein said at an earlier hearing that the case could cause “ chaos ” if it went ahead .
the case was one of several similar challenges to cruz ’ s eligibility to run for the white house - including suits in alabama , illinois , pennsylvania and texas .
the illinois suit was dismissed last week on a technicality .
republican front-runner donald trump has repeatedly brought up questions about whether cruz meets the constitutional requirement to be president .
the constitution says that to be president , a person must be a “ natural-born citizen ” of the united states .
cruz has argued that he is eligible to run because of his mother ’ s u.s. citizenship , and many legal experts say it is unlikely any judge in the united states would block his presidential bid .
cruz ’ s father is a cuban immigrant .
a lawyer for the objectors , roger bernstein , said “ an appeal is likely. ” ( editing by richard valdmanis and leslie adler ) this article was funded in part by sap .
