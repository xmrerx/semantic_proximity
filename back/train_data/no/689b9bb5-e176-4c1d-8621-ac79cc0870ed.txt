brazzaville ( reuters ) - the government of congo republic on saturday agreed a ceasefire with rebels in the southeast region of pool , halting a 15-year conflict that rights groups say has cost dozens of lives and forced tens of thousands to flee .
political violence spiked in the central african oil producer after a contested presidential election in april 2016 was won by president denis sassou nguesso , who has ruled for 33 of the last 38 years .
a militia led by frederic bintsamou , better known as pastor ntumi , which fought sassou nguesso during and after a 1997 civil war , has been blamed by the government for deadly raids on police , military and government bases , and has also halted trade through the pool region with blockades .
in return , the government has bombed the pool region , including one helicopter raid last year on a residential area that amnesty international said killed at least 30 people .
the unrest has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes and sparked allegations from human rights groups of abuse by government troops .
ntumi s so-called ninja rebels have clashed with the congo government since 2002 and have long sought an end to government military intervention in the pool region .
the peace agreement between the two sides was signed by interior ministry security advisor fran ois nd and pastor ntumi s representative , jean gustave ntondo .
today is a great day for the congolese .
this is the day we have just signed the cessation of hostilities agreement , said ntondo .
under the deal , the militias have agreed to hand over arms and allow the free movement of trade between the capital brazzaville and the commercial hub of pointe noire .
during hostilities , trains and cars were often halted by militias .
the government will oversee a commission that will monitor the peace , and loosen security in the region to allow people to travel to and from their family homes .
