DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Friday gave a cautious welcome to a speech in Florence by British Prime Minister Theresa May, who called for Britain to stay in the single market under its current terms during a two-year transition period.
I d give the speech a cautious welcome.
I think it is a genuine effort by the prime minister to move things along and make progress, Varadkar told journalists.
We will of course need further clarity and further understanding as to how a transition period might work.
But requesting a transition period is also a step in the right direction, he said.
Varadkar said he was particularly happy about May s reassertion of support for protections for Northern Ireland s Good Friday peace deal and for a frictionless border between Ireland and Northern Ireland with no physical infrastructure.
