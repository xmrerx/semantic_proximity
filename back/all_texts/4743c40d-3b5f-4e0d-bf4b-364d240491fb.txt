Politico has terminated its contract with magazine writer Julia Ioffe after she sent a tweet that referenced a possible incestuous relationship between President-elect Donald Trump and his daughter, Ivanka.In a note to Politico staff Wednesday, Editor-in-Chief John Harris and Editor Carrie Budoff Brown said Ioffe violated guidelines against displaying gratuitous opinion on social media.
Julia Ioffe s tweet this afternoon about President-elect Trump currently and understandably racing across social media is a clear example of the opposite of what we were talking about.
Julia had previously announced she is taking her work to the Atlantic.
We have accelerated the close of her POLITICO contributor contract, effective immediately.
PoynterEarlier in the day, Ioffe sent out this vile tweet:Ioffe is by no means an objective journalist (we re not even sure she s actually a journalist), but she does like to stir it up on Twitter with provocative and controversial tweets, like this one mocking the skin color of Trump s cabinet.
Of course, she s making a lame attempt at trying to define Trump as a racist:Time to introduce the hashtag #administrationsowhite?
