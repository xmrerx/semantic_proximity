MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough was caught on a hot mic making a snarky suggestion that President Donald Trump is not a Christian, just as Morning Joe went to a commercial break.
After spending much of the show criticizing Trump s proposed budget, the show went to a commercial break.
Mika Brzezinski said that after the break they would discuss Trump s visit with the Pope: Coming up, they didn t actually see eye to eye during the presidential campaign, so what happened during Donald Trump s meeting today with Pope Francis?
We ll go through that and what drove them apart in the first place, straight ahead on Morning Joe.'
As she stopped speaking, music began to play.
That is when Joe Scarborough appeared to criticize Trump and imply that he is not a Christian: Oh, the Pope s Christian, Scarborough said in an apparent reference to the differences between the Pope and Trump:Trump memorably feuded with the Pope last year when the religious leader suggested anyone who focused on building walls is not Christian.
Trump, who campaigned on building a southern border wall, shot back that to question his faith was disgraceful.
