Apparently, Republicans were serious when they decided that Trump s election means they don t have to be politically correct (translation: pretend to be decent human beings) anymore.
Recordings obtained by the heroes at Motor City Muckraker have caught yet another member of the Grand Old Party acting like a racist and sexist jackass or, if you prefer, being himself.Today s subject is Warren, Michigan Mayor Jim Fouts.
The recordings include a few interesting right-wing facts.
For instance, here is Fouts explaining that blacks do look like chimpanzees.
Here he is just straight-up saying n*gger.
In another recording, Fouts explains that he won t date older women because they re ugly and dried out.
In another recording, he further explains that older women are mean, hateful, dried-up c*nts In December, Fouts was fired from his weekly A.M. radio show for saying that the disabled aren t even human beings.
But according to him, all of it was completely fabricated by one of his critics, who apparently is a master of impressions.
This recording was not me!
(he has the expertise available to him to electronically engineer it), Fouts wrote in a December Facebook post after he was fired for his remarks about the differently-abled.
This is a PHONY tape.
Like Trump, he claims there is a pretty brutal negative agenda against him one in which even reality is participating.Featured image via Facebook
