Ever since same-sex marriage became the law of the land, Bible Belt states have been pushing back on it.
Of course, we all remember the Kim Davis fiasco, where the Rowan County, Kentucky County Clerk went to jail rather than issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
Now, we have something similar happening in Arkansas, where the state was refusing to put the names of same-sex parents on their children s birth certificates.
However, the Supreme Court handed down a decision forcing the state of Arkansas to treat same-sex couples just like they treat opposite-sex couples.The decision that was handed down was 6-3, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissenting.
This comes as no surprise, since those are the three most conservative justices on the court.
Further, it gives us just a taste of what we are in for with Trump s new justice, and it isn t good.
The case reached the highest court in the land as the result of two women who filed a suit against the state when they insisted that it was not a right to have both parents listed on their infant s certificate of birth.
First, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, so the case went to the Supreme Court, where it was struck down.Luckily, this is a 6-3 ruling, so it s not on a razor s edge, like some rulings in favor of equality have been including Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized marriage equality nationwide.
With talk of the potential retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is usually the swing vote on the Court, there could be a lot of anti-equality rulings if Trump puts another right-wing asshole up for consideration.
The last great hope is that the Democrats are able to take the Senate back in 2018, and Justice Kennedy will wait until then to retire.
For now, we can be happy that the Court did the right thing in this case.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
