rome ( reuters ) - italy seized more than 24 million tablets of a synthetic opiate that islamic state militants planned to sell to finance attacks around the world , the head of a southern italian court said on friday .
the pills were seized by finance police and customs officials in the container port of gioia tauro , italy s biggest , according to a statement .
the u.s. drug enforcement administration collaborated in the investigation .
a video shows police opening a container filled with boxes of tramadol , a powerful painkiller normally available only on prescription .
with an average sale price of about 2 euros ( $ 2.33 ) per tablet , the haul was worth 50 million euros , the statement said .
foreign investigators told the court in the city of reggio calabria that the drugs belonged to islamic state .
the drugs sales were managed directly by islamic state to finance the terrorist activities planned and carried out around the world , reggio calabria s chief prosecutor federico cafiero de raho said .
part of the illegal profit from their sale would have been used to finance extremist groups in libya , syria and iraq , he said .
the seizure comes three days after an uzbek immigrant , sayfullo saipov , drove a truck on a new york city bike path , killing eight , in the latest attack claimed by islamic state .
no details on how the illegal shipment was discovered or on its final destination were provided by the court .
a similar shipment was discovered in greece last year , and an even larger one was found in italy s genoa port in may .
