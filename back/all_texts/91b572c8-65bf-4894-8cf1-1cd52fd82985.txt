WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There will be no planned announcement on Friday of U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for FBI director, the White House said.
Trump fired the former director James Comey on May 9 in a surprise announcement that sparked days of political turmoil.
On Thursday, the president said he was close to choosing a replacement.
