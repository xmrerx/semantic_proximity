Trump University went out of business years ago, but because Donald Trump is talking about bringing it back, Jimmy Fallon decided to weigh the pros and cons of attending the failed school.Interspersing his best Trump impressions throughout the bit, Fallon hilariously listed the pros and cons of going to Trump University should it return if Trump becomes president.Pro: The university will offer hundreds of classes.Con: Or as Trump put it, It s very, very classy.
Fallon mentioned another pro being that tuition would be free with the con being that Mexico would be forced to pay for it, which Fallon joked that s one way to do it.
Currently, Trump is claiming that he will force Mexico to pay for his proposed massive wall along the US-Mexico border.Then it was on to the next pro and con.Pro: Trump boasted about the school s large endowment.Con: By saying I guarantee you there s no problem down there.
That con was a reference to Trump talking about the size of his penis during a presidential debate.
Seriously.Then Fallon moved on to the next pro, which led to another twist of a con.Pro: Hiding the bong on parents weekend.Con: Because Bong s student visa ran out and now Trump wants to deport him.Trump has based most of his campaign on blaming immigrants for America s problems and has vowed to deport them all if he becomes president, which has resulted in Trump and his supporters hurling racist hate speech against people of color and some incidents of violence against them.And then Fallon hit Trump hard.Pro: Going to graduation and putting on your white cap and gown.Con: Having a hard time seeing through the eye holes.Fallon went on to compare Trump University s logo to Trump s hair on a windy day and said that seeing a Trump University diploma hanging on the wall in a doctor s office should make anyone back out slowly to seek a different doctor.Here s the video via YouTube:Another masterful mocking of Trump by the Tonight Show host.Featured image via screenshot
