manchester , england ( reuters ) - britain will leave the european union , its single market and customs union as one nation , its minister for northern ireland said on sunday , dashing any hope the region could keep such close economic ties to avoid any return of a hard border .
at a speech at the conservative party s annual conference in manchester , northern england , james brokenshire drew applause when he said : we will leave the european union in 2019 as one united kingdom .
that includes leaving the single market and the customs union so that we can strike new trade deals with the rest of the world .
irish prime minister leo varadkar called last month for the eu and britain to find unique solutions to their brexit logjam , including a bespoke customs union .
that would solve the problem of a hard border in ireland once britain has left the eu , something that is of great concern to dublin .
