Not holding back one bit after her absolute victory in South Carolina over Senator Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton focused on the end goal and what is best for the United States of America as a whole.
She knows that in order to really bring the change that is needed to progress the nation forward, we don t need to make America great again, because it s already pretty damn fantastic.
Rather, we need to focus on coming together and tear down the barriers that have been holding so many citizens back for so long.Hillary went after Donald Trump s ridiculous slogan head-on, and simply told it like it is: Despite what you hear, we don t need to make America great again.
America has never stopped being great.
But, we do need to make America whole again.
Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers.
We need to show by everything that we do that we are in this together.
While Trump is focused on dividing us and relying on racism at the polls, Hillary is focused on bringing us together and pushing as forward.
Her speech not only demolished Trump s outright stupid slogan, but relayed the much-needed message that we re all in this together.
