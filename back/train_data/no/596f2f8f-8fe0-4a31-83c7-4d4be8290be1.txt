up to that date , it was the largest act of domestic terrorism in america , killing some 168 people including nineteen children .
however , many have questioned the government s official account of events .
a noble lie re-investigates the bombing and re-examines the event s alleged perpetrators , as well as other unlikely role player on the periphery .
what this film reveals may shock many viewers who thought they knew what happened that day , exposing information never before examined or brought to the attention of the american public .
