BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kuwait s ambassador to Lebanon told President Michel Aoun the Gulf monarchy supports his efforts to overcome the delicate situation and stands by Lebanese sovereignty, Aoun said in a tweet on Tuesday.
Lebanon s Saudi-allied Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri declared his resignation on Nov. 4 in a broadcast from Riyadh, throwing Lebanon into political crisis.
Saudi Arabia, an ally of Kuwait, has accused Lebanon of declaring war on it because of the influence of Iran-backed Hezbollah, and has advised Saudi citizens to leave Lebanon.
