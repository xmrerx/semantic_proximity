Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House who resigned in shame and turned into Trump s biggest cheerleader, has a new litmus test to determine if a federal worker keeps their job: did they vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?While discussing the Trump Administration s budget in which $10.5 trillion will be cut fro, various government programs Gingrich told the Heritage Foundation that in order to balance the relationship between Trump and the bureaucracy, federal workers who voted for or supported Clinton would be fired: All those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted for Clinton.
There won t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them.
The budget, which is modeled after the Heritage Foundation s, is seeking to nearly cut all discretionary spending to every federal bureaucracy, which includes federal agency budget cuts by 10 percent and employee cuts by 20 percent.
Coincidentally, 20 percent of the federal workforce is black, and almost 90 percent of blacks voted for Clinton.But, again, I m sure it s just a coincidence The dog whistle is becoming louder and louder.
The fact that this revelation isn t making widespread headlines is a failure of mainstream journalism.
A former powerful politician with close ties to the current Administration is advocating for the firing of people with different political affiliations.This is a political witch hunt that mirrors the dark days of McCarthyism.
Because someone doesn t subscribe to the racist, sexist, xenophobic and authoritarian regime that is the Trump presidency they risk losing their job doing low level, non-political jobs.Whatever happened to the Republican mantra that people be judged based on their ethics and results?
In Trump s America, it s all about blind patriotism and racism.Blind ideology, suppression of facts and science, and now vendettas.
The GOP has become a vehicle for a fascist authoritarian regime, and Trump is leading the movement.Remember when the GOP was outraged that the IRS was targeting conservative groups for their political affiliations?
Why aren t Democrats more outraged over this rank hypocrisy?The resistance starts with resisting everyone in Trump s camp, not just Trump himself.Featured image via Flickr
