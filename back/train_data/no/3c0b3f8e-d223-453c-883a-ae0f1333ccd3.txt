brussels ( reuters ) - the european union s executive offered initial backing on thursday to a franco-german proposal to allow more permanent border checks within the bloc s free-travel zone .
five countries in the so-called schengen travel zone - germany , france , denmark , austria and norway - restarted border controls after 2015 attacks in paris and in an attempt to control the movement of refugees and migrants arriving in the bloc in unprecedented numbers the same year .
schengen rules allow for the reintroduction of such frontier controls for up to two years and the ones now in place expire in november .
germany and france , aiming for an extension and the ability to reinstate them in future , asked the eu to change the system to extend the maximum duration to four years .
a joint proposal by paris and berlin , seen by reuters , says that would be required in the context of a long-term terrorist threat after a raft of deadly islamist attacks in europe .
the commission recognizes that new security challenges have appeared in the past years , as demonstrated by the recent terrorist attacks in barcelona and turku , the eu s migration chief , dimitris avramopoulos , told journalists after talks with eu s interior ministers .
he said the brussels-based commission would propose an update to the schengen borders code later this month .
french interior minister gerard collomb told journalists after the talks in brussels : we had raised this problem some time ago with my german colleague ... and from what i heard from the commissioner he indeed wants to make the schengen code more flexible ... to allow us to protect our borders against terrorism .
