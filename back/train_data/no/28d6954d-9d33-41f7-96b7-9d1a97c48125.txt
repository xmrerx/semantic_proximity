bogota ( reuters ) - a landslide killed at least four people and left 18 missing in southwest colombia , authorities said on wednesday , as the country grappled once again with the deadly pairing of heavy rains and poor infrastructure .
landslides are common in rural , mountainous areas of colombia , especially during wetter parts of the year .
in april more than 300 people died in a landslide in mocoa , putumayo .
warnings of flash flooding on tuesday night near the town of corinto , which sits at the foot of one of the country s andean ranges in cauca province , came too late , some residents told local media .
videos on social media showed water rushing down darkened streets as rain-swollen rivers overflowed and sent mud and rocks down onto buildings .
president juan manuel santos visited corinto on wednesday to promise aid to its 30,000 residents , as rescue workers continued to search for the missing .
the government said more than 3,000 people were evacuated from a nearby area before the landslide struck tuesday evening .
the government will pay rent for those left homeless and help with funeral expenses , santos said .
the local school , which partially collapsed , may have to be relocated , he said .
