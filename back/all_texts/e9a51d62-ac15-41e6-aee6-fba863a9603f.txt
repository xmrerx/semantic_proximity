Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani told black fathers who are worried about the safety of their sons that the real danger isn t police officers.
Oh no, of course not.
The real danger is other black kids.
During an appearance on CBS s Face The Nation, Giuliani said that black fathers need to teach their sons to respect law enforcement and recognize that the real danger comes from within the inherently violent black community.If I were a black father, and I was concerned with the safety of my child, really concerned about it and not in a politically activist sense, I would say, Be very respectful of the police.
Most of them are good.
Some can be very bad.
And just be very careful.I d also say, be very careful of those kids in the neighborhood and don t get involved with them because, son, there s a 99 percent chance they re going to kill you, not the police.
And we ve got to hear that from the black community.
And what we ve got to hear from the black community is how and what they are doing among themselves about the crime problem in the black community.Giulini has a long history of pushing the myth of black on black crime.
He doubled down on his argument this Sunday, completely ignoring the fact that when these other black kids that he speaks of commit a murder, they go to jail.
However, when a cop is the one that pulls the trigger all they get is a paid vacation, even when there are witnesses and video evidence.If you want to deal with this on the black side, you ve got to teach your children to be respectful to the police, and you ve got to teach your children that the real danger to them is not the police, the real danger to them 99 out of 100 times are other black kids who are going to kill them.
That s the way they re going to die.Watch Giuliani s interview here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8cUAb3df0M]Featured image via video screen capture
