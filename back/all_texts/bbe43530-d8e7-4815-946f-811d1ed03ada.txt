Generations upon generations of incest have apparently caused the gerbils operating the brain of Alaska state Representative David Eastman to go on strike.
As House Republicans are directly attacking the American people with their new Trumpcare plan, news broke that Eastman a lawmaker from Wasilla, Sarah Palin s neck of th1e woods decided to make the GOP sound even more heartless and stupid than they previously seemed.Eastman, who views the elimination of a clump of cells as the ultimate form of child abuse, recently tacked an anti-abortion message onto a state House resolution meant to raise awareness about sexual assault and child abuse a message he says could not possibly be delivered without badgering people about abortion.
Abortion is a very serious issue, and it needs to be talked about, Eastman says, adding that women get pregnant just so they can get a free trip to the city for their glamorous abortion: We have folks who try to get pregnant in this state so that they can get a free trip to the city, and we have folks who want to carry their baby past the point of being able to have an abortion in this state so that they can have a free trip to Seattle.
Medicaid can fund a woman s travel to Anchorage or Seattle if they seek an abortion.
Asked for evidence that women get pregnant just to take advantage of the free travel a nonsensical claim Eastman said that a number of people have come to (his) office with stories, experiences.
He offered no evidence to back the claim.This isn t the first horrible thing Eastman has done or said.
KTUU notes that he recently was the only person to vote against resolutions honoring black soldiers who helped build the Alaska Highway during World War II and another honoring Hmong and Lao veterans who fought for the U.S. during the Vietnam War.
Those resolutions had otherwise unanimous support.It is unclear if he has f*cked himself yet, or if he still needs to do that.Watch him shame his state below:Featured image via video screenshot
