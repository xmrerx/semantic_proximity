colombo ( reuters ) - sri lankan monks and hardline nationalists protesters forced 31 rohingya muslim asylum seekers to flee a united nations safe house in the capital colombo on tuesday , police said .
the refugees , who were arrested in april along with two suspected indian traffickers in a boat in sri lankan seas , were taken into protective custody and then to a detention center outside colombo , police spokesman ruwan gunasekara said .
a live telecast on the facebook page of sinhale jathika balamuluwa , a hardline nationalist group , showed the buddhist monks and some civilians storming the safe house chanting do not allow terrorists into this country .
the rohingya group fled myanmar in 2012 and lived in india as refugees for nearly five years before trying to migrate illegally , a lawyer representing them told reuters .
a local court later handed them over to un human rights council ( unhrc ) .
unhrc officials were not immediately available for comment .
these rohingyans are a group of terrorists .
they have slaughtered our buddhist monks in myanmar , akmeemana dayarathne a buddhist monk who led the protest told the gathering .
tens of thousands muslim rohingya have fled mostly buddhist myanmar since 2012 .
tension between majority buddhists and rohingya , most of whom are denied citizenship , has simmered for decades in rakhine , but it has exploded several times over the past few years , as old enmities , and buddhist nationalism , surfaced with the end of decades of harsh military rule .
about 69,000 rohingyas have fled to bangladesh since october , straining relations between the two neighbors who each see the stateless muslim minority as the other nation s problem .
