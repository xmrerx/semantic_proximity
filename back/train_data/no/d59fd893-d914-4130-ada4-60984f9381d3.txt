the broke city of chicago installed a golden sculpture that spells out real fake right smack in front of trump international hotel and tower in the city s downtown area .
so the city spent money they don t have to slam president trump ?
no wonder people are leaving the city in droves filmmaker @ imandrewmarcus ( me ) reacts to # realfake sculpture that # realbroke chicago paid to install outside trump tower .

the statue is bolted into a large public sidewalk space in front of trump tower , an area that over the past year has been commonly used for trump protesters who gather to demonstrate and for tourists and supporters who want a picture in front of the glistening blue sky scraper .
art at its best makes a statement .
and this piece certainly makes a real statement .
