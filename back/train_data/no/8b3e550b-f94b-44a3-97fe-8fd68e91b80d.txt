many republicans often argue raising the minimum wage or increasing taxes on the rich would kill jobs and hurt the economy , but minnesota s democratic governor , mark dayton , completely debunked those arguments in practice.dayton , a billionaire who s great-grandfather started dayton s , which would later become target , inherited a $ 6.2 billion deficit when he took office as the governor of minnesota in 2011 after republican governor tim pawlenty ran the state into the ground.dayton was a former u.s .
senator , and of the few to vote against the iraq war , but he left office disenfranchised with politics in washington dc , as he felt his liberalism left his hands tied in terms of enacting meaningful legislative reforms.in his home state , he had much better success enacting liberal policies .
governor dayton reduced the deficit and increased tax revenue by taxing individuals who made more than $ 150,000 two percent more , from 7.85 percent in state income tax to 9.85 percent , or over $ 2 billion in extra revenue for the state annually .
he also increased the minimum wage and passed an equal pay for women law , despite conservatives in the state criticizing him for these efforts.the result was the creation of over 170,000 new jobs to minnesota s economy , which now has one of the highest employment rates in the country .
the median income in the state is also $ 8,000 more than the national average .
that multi-billion dollar budget deficit he inherited is also now a $ 1 billion surplus.in contrast , during the same time wisconsin s republican governor scott walker broadened poverty levels to the highest they have been in decades by decreasing taxes on the wealthy .
trickle down economics is a myth perpetuated by republicans that continues to damage our economy and increase poverty .
any conservatives who maintain these arguments should just be pointed to the success democratic governor mark dayton has had in boosting minnesota s economy with his progressive reforms , and he implemented them with a republican controlled state legislature for his first two years in office .
