spot on rachel zonation the obamas pride themselves on being staples in the black community who can do no wrong in the eyes of african americans .
unfortunately for them , however , more and more black people are turning on the obamas and seeing them for what they really are.after seeing michelle obama s graduation speech at the predominantly black tuskegee university , tv show host alfonso rachel knew that he could stay silent no longer .
he took to his internet talk show to slam the first lady in a video that has gotten over 25,000 views in just 3 days.here s an excerpt of what he said : if knowledge is power and you are graduating with the power of knowledge then how are you going to tolerate this agitator coming in to convince you , that you re a victim , despite the power you re graduating with .
you are the first freaking lady of the united states and you re still a spoiled butt-hurt victim , whining about unfairness .
you re not interested in representing the united states , you re not interested in representing all the people , your interest is in representing the black community and as the first lady you have represented us as bitter and spoiled .
the only hope that people like you have , michelle obama is that people will be as miserable as you .
