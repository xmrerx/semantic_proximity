panama city ( reuters ) - panama is on track to hit a record level of illegal narcotics seizures this year after authorities over the weekend seized about 2 tonnes of cocaine near the central american country s border with colombia , officials said on monday .
the total drug confiscations in full-year 2017 are expected to surpass the previous annual record of 72 tonnes confiscated last year , security minister alexis bethancourt told reporters , adding that the uptick is due to better coordination among local law enforcement agencies as well as help from friendly countries .
the weekend drug bust was made in the border province of darien on a boat from colombia , the national border agency senafront said at a press conference .
panamanian president juan carlos varela has previously complained that a peace deal between the colombian government and the marxist farc rebel group has led to a spike in drug trafficking and violence in panama .
