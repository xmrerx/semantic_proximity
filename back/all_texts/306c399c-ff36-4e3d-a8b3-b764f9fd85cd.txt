NBC News chairman Andy Lack confessed to nervousness about Megyn Kelly s upcoming network morning show, saying the risk is unnerving and a little scary.
Lack s confession about Kelly s upcoming debut is not exactly a vote of confidence for their $17 million golden girl Kelly, the former Fox News host, is debuting her daily 9 a.m.
ET show Megyn Kelly Today on Sept. 25.
Her summertime Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly newsmagazine program served as a test launch of sorts, but it disappointed, both critically and in the ratings.Lack signed Kelly away from Fox with an offer reportedly worth more than $17 million a year.
Her show will follow Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer on NBC s treasured Today show, which wins its time slot in the vaunted 25-to-54 demographic.
