moscow ( reuters ) - the united states is providing de-facto cover for islamic state units in syria and only pretending to fight terrorism in the middle east , the russian defence ministry said on tuesday .
the ministry said the u.s. air force had tried to hinder russian strikes on islamic state militants around the syrian town of albu kamal .
these facts are conclusive evidence that the united states , while imitating an uncompromising fight against international terrorism for the global community , in fact provides cover for islamic state units , the defense ministry said .
