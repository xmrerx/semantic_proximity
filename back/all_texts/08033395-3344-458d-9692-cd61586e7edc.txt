Republicans aren t very smart about a lot of things, but one of their most unfortunate mental deficits is in their awareness of what they sound like to the rest of the world.
Whether they simply are too dumb to know, or they just don t care, the way they portray America to the rest of the world is a damned embarrassment to the nation.One of the worst sources of this global shame is easily Donald Trump, for obvious reasons.
His stupidity, empty talk, hate and chest beating are dragging us back to pre-Obama levels of global ridicule.
However, now things are taking a departure from simple mockery and turning into a serious international incident.North Korea is now using Trump s rhetoric regarding nuclear proliferation, and the fact thath e is actually advocating using them, as justification for not backing down on their nuclear program.
This is the same North Korea that only about a month ago wanted to have their nuclear weapons ready to fire at a moment s notice, and promised to expand their arsenal.Ri Jong Ryul, deputy-director general of the Institute of International Studies in Pyongyang had this to say: Donald Trump s remarks are totally absurd and illogical.
The U.S. tells us to give up our nuclear program, is preparing a nuclear attack against us, and on the other hand would tell its allies to have nuclear weapons.
Isn t this (a) double standard?

Now, they hear a person that could be the Presidential nominee of the most war-loving political party in modern American history advocating for more nuclear weapons to be developed, as well as the actual use of them against nations like North Korea.
Perhaps one day Republicans will understand that people outside of the U.S. also do listen to our politics, but sadly that doesn t seem to be today.Featured image via Mother Jones
