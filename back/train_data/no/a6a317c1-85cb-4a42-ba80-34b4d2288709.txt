beijing ( reuters ) - violent incidents in myanmar s rakhine state are unacceptable and there should be understanding of the myanmar government s efforts to protect social stability , chinese foreign minister wang yi told his indonesian counterpart , state media said .
more than 400,000 muslim rohingya have fled across the border to bangladesh following a counter-insurgency offensive by myanmar s army in the wake of militant attacks on security forces .
u.n. officials have described myanmar s strategy as ethnic cleansing .
the remarks by wang to indonesian foreign minister retno marsudi on the sidelines of a united nations meeting in new york on tuesday , however , appeared to show some sympathy for the difficulties myanmar faces quelling the insurgency .
the rohingya issue has been around for a long time , and it is complex and sensitive , wang said , according to the official xinhua news agency .
the urgent task is to ease the tense situation as quickly as possible , avoid innocent people being harmed , prevent the humanitarian crisis spreading , and encouraging and supporting myanmar and bangladesh to seek a fundamental resolution via dialogue and consultation , he said .
china , which has close economic and diplomatic ties with myanmar , is willing to continue playing a constructive role along with the international community , wang added .
myanmar leader aung san suu kyi on tuesday condemned rights abuses in rakhine state and said violators would be punished , but she did not address u.n. accusations of ethnic cleansing , drawing cool international responses and calls for action to help minority muslim rohingya .
western diplomats and aid officials , hoping for an unequivocal condemnation of violence and hate speech , welcomed the tone of the nobel peace laureate s message , but some doubted if she had done enough to deflect global criticism .
