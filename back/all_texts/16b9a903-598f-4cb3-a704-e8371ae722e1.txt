For 15 hours (now the 8th longest filibuster in Senate history), Senate Democrats stood their ground and demanded the Senate take up gun control measures in the wake of the terrorist attack in Orlando.
For 15 hours, 37 senators including two Republicans and two Independents stood before the American people and relentlessly pleaded their case as to why urgent action was needed.Well, it worked.
After pledging to hold the floor until something, anything, was done, Republicans caved.At roughly 2 AM (Washington time), Senator Chris Murphy, who launched the historic filibuster, announced that the Senate will take up closing the terror gap and universal background checks: It is our understanding that we have been given a commitment on a path forward to get votes on the floor of the Senate on a measure to assure that those on the terrorist watch list do not get guns and an amendment to expand background checks to gun shows and to internet sales.
Thanking the millions of people who tuned in, called and emailed their congressional representatives, and stood strong against gun violence, Murphy vowed to push on defiantly no matter what the Senate chooses to do when the votes come in.While Murphy and other Senate Democrats spoke on the floor, Republican John Cornyn, the Senate s no.
2, and Democrat Dianne Feinstein began crafting legislation to ban suspected terrorists on a watchlist from buying guns.
However, Chuck Schumer, who is poised to become Majority Leader should the Democrats take back the Senate, warned fellow Democrats to be cautious of Cornyn s compromises, saying it was filled with hoops and ladders.
The Senators that spoke on the floor were:If your senator made the list, congratulations.
If not (except Feinstein), shame.
This historic filibuster will be one generations will look back on and ask why it had to happen.
It took 15 hours of nonstop talking to get Mitch McConnell to agree to no-brainier legislation.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images
