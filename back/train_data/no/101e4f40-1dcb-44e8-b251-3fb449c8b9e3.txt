rep. tim ryan ( d. ohio ) had launched a bid to unseat pelosi as house minority leader , arguing that the democratic party needs a new message and new messenger .
he has said after the election that the democratic party is no longer a national party , only representing the coasts and ignoring middle america , which turned out in support of donald trump over hillary clinton.the old guard in the democrat party is hanging on and just won t let go .
pelosi has had a gaffe-filled year so 2017 should be pretty interesting with republicans in charge .
pelosi unhinged in 2017 ?
