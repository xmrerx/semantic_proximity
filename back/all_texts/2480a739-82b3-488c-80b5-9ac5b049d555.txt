While speaking in front of United States servicemembers at a recent USO event with both President Obama and Vice President Biden, David Letterman made a joke that many of us would really like to be a reality.
He played off his age and said that his mind seemed to be playing tricks on him.
He claimed that by listening to the two men speak, he thought the president and vice president were running for a third term.Letterman told the USO crowd: I don t know, sometimes the mind plays tricks on a person, especially when you get to be my age.
I was listening to the president speak.
I was listening to the vice president speak.
And, for a split second, my mind said to me, oh, that s nice, they re running again.'
Which at first was received by laughter, and then uproarious applause and cheers.And while it s true that President Obama cannot run for a third term, if he could, he would likely win.
History will be very kind to Obama as all of his accomplishments make him one of the greatest leaders in the history of the republic.Watch the clip here: USO Crowd Roars As David Letterman Jokes About by DailyPoliticsFeatured image via video screen capture
