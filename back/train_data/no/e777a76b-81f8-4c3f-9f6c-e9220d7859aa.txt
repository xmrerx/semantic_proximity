the city s first transgender police officer was kept out of an event at the san diego lgbt community center because she was wearing her uniform.the transgender day of awareness , an annual event to honor those who lost their lives to anti-transgender violence , was held nov. 17 in the hillcrest neighborhood .
officer christine garcia , who transitioned last year , helped plan the event and was part of the police department security detail that watched over a commemorative march down university avenue .
after the march , when garcia tried to enter the event as a member of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer community , she was asked to leave because her uniform could upset others in attendance .
when leaders at the center learned what had happened , they apologized to garcia and san diego police chief shelley zimmerman .
we do not wish to ever make any community member feel unwelcome these officers are valued members of our community , delores jacobs , chief executive officer of the lgbt center , said in a statement .
jacobs said the occurrence was a misunderstanding of the center s existing policy of inclusion , which seeks to acknowledge the concerns that members of the community may have without excluding others .
leaders have reviewed the policy with its staff since the event .
while we need to support those that are uncomfortable and honor their reactions to valid and understandable difficult previous experiences , we also need to explain that our lgbtq san diego police liaisons are a valued part of our community , jacobs wrote .
longtime lgbtq activist , city commissioner nicole murray-ramirez , said the incident was an outrage .
any officer , be they gay or straight , should be welcomed into our community center in uniform , he said .
