Kathryn Knott was convicted of a hate crime for helping friends in a gay bashing assault on a same-sex couple on a Philadelphia street in 2014.
She is also the daughter of Chalfont Borough Police Chief Karl Knott, which is most likely why she thinks that she deserves special consideration in this case after she blew her chance at no jail time.Knott was offered a plea deal for probation, which her two cohorts accepted, but insisted she was just an innocent bystander to the crime and turned down the deal.
Instead, she opted for a trial where surveillance footage proved she was a damned liar.
After the trial, she was found guilty and sentenced to 5-10 months of jail time.Of course, this is an unacceptable situation for her, even though she made her choice to reject the plea.
Now, she and her lawyers are demanding that her jail sentence is transformed into a public service announcement to take the infamy of the arrest and maybe heal some wounds.
Her lawyer is arguing that she is being punished for exercising her constitutional right to have a trial, by the harsher sentence being imposed after she refused a plea deal.Let s change this up just a bit.
A group of 3 poor, black young adults assaults a heterosexual white couple, beating them up severely, and leaving one with a broken jaw.
The same exact sequence of events follows up to the request of one one be let out of jail by doing a PSA.
This would be laughed out of court.She helped beat up a gay couple, leaving them traumatized and one with a broken jaw.
She had a chance to accept responsibility and take probation.
She blew it by rejecting a deal, but because she s a police chief s princess daughter both she and her lawyer think that grown-up consequences don t apply to her.
She deserves every damned day of punishment that she gets, and being a white police chief s daughter is not an excuse.Featured image from Philly Declaration
