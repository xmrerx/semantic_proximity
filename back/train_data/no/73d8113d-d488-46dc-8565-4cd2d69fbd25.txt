why would the vatican invite an aggressive leftist speaker to the rollout of the pope s papal document on phony global climate change ?
as a catholic , the news about the pope s support of these horrible leftists and their radical agenda is heartbreaking .
pray for our nation one of the speakers slated for the vatican rollout of the long-awaited papal document on climate change once said the earth is overpopulated by at least 6 billion people.the teaching document , called an encyclical , is scheduled for release on june 18 at vatican city .
perhaps with the exception of the 1968 encyclical on contraception , no vatican document has been greeted with such anticipation.the political left is hoping for a document that ties belief in global warming to a religious obligation .
climate skeptics have already started criticizing the document.the choice of professor john schnellnhuber , founding director of the postdam institute for climate impact research , as one of three presenters may be giving the left added hope and giving giving skeptics severe heartburn .
he has been described as one of the more aggressive scientists on the question of man-made global warming.in a talk given to what s described as the failed 2009 copenhagen climate conference , reported in the new york times , schnellnhuber , who has advised german president angela merkel and is a visiting professor at oxford , said of global warming : in a very cynical way , it s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something - namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet , namely below 1 billion people .
schnellnhuber is also author of what s called the two-degree target that says governments must not allow the temperature to rise more than 2 degrees higher than at the start of the industrial revolution .
any higher , the theory holds , and much life on earth would either perish or be gravely harmed.to deal with climate issues , he has also called for an earth constitution that would transcend the un charter along with the creation of a global council elected by all the people on earth and a planetary court .. a transnational legal body open to appeals from everybody , especially with respect to violations of the earth constitution .
