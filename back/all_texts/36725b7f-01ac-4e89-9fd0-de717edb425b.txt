Starbucks has pledged to hire 10,000 refugees in response to President Donald Trump s controversial immigrant ban.
CEO Howard Schultz said in a letter to employees Sunday the company would hire refugees from 75 different countries over a five-year period.
We are living in an unprecedented time, one in which we are witness to the conscience of our country, and the promise of the American Dream, being called into question.
These uncertain times call for different measures and communication tools than we have used in the past, Schultz said in the letter.

Even those who aided our military.
Media said nothing.
