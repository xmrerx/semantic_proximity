Jack Keane said this is a major setback for Russia and Iran, close allies of the regime of Syrian President Bashar-al Assad.
These airstrikes are a sign that the U.S. is open to taking a more aggressive role in the Syrian civil war.
This is an incredible message.
It should have been sent many years ago by the Obama administration.
MARK STEYN NAILS IT ON INTERVENTION IN SYRIA:Mark Steyn nailed it when he said that President Trump should be cautious about using American power to overthrow a dictator without a very clear endgame: To go back to the Democrats most notorious debacle, Hillary thought knocking off Gaddafi in Libya would be easy and cost-free.
What we know now is that it left a power vacuum and further destabilized the Middle East.
You ve got to have an endgame here.
You ve got to know what you want Syria to look like after Assad, or it s a waste of time.
Trump has been very clear that he regards running around Afghanistan for 15 years as a complete waste of time.
He doesn t want to get into a similar situation.
