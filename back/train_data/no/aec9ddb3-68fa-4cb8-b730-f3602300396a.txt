cnn host fareed zakaria explained how he thought president donald trump rose to power : the election of donald trump is really a kind of class rebellion against people like us , educated professionals who live in cities , who have cosmopolitan views about things .
wth ? ? ?
but that wasn t it zakaria decided to further offend just about every trump supporter out there : there s a part of america that is sick and tired of being told what to do by this overeducated population that hillary clinton perfectly represented .
that s why they re sticking with him , he continued.zakaria also blamed racism and diversity on trump s rise .
he knew that the election of a black president had stirred a kind of ugly racial animus .
a small subset but he knew how to get them zakaria said .
a real sense of cultural alienation , older , white , noncollege education americans have , a sense that their country is changing because of immigrants .
because maybe blacks are rising up to a central place in society , because gays being afforded equal rights .
because of , frankly , working women .
everybody is muscling in on the territory that the white working man had , zakaria said.this guy has no idea of who makes up america he should be fired for such a disgusting rant ! via : wfb
