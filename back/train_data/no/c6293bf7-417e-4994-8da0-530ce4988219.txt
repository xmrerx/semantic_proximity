how many hillary supporters does it take to fill a basket of serious sex offenders ?
let s see , there s bill and then there s bill s pedophile friend jeffrey epstein , and oh yeah now we can add tony to the basket of men who assault the candidate who represents women ? something tells me trump supporters would rather be in hillary s imaginary basket of deplorables you might remember a hispanic political activist named tony yapias , who was extremely critical of donald trump s assertion that some illegal mexican aliens were rapists.tony yapias is the director of proyecto latino de utah .
mr. yapias also coordinated numerous protest events against donald trump including a rather violent display in salt lake city , utah.yes , it appears mexican rapist tony yapias felt additionally empowered by the fact his victim was less likely to be able to contact law enforcement.however , as fox13 in salt lake city reports : [ ] despite the woman s fears concerning immigration issues , court documents state , she reported the assault the day after it happened .
she was also examined by a forensic nurse who found she had multiple physical injuries consistent with her explanation of what happened ( link ) mr. yapias threatened , raped and blackmailed his victim specifically because of her undocumented illegal immigration status .
conservative treehousewatch tony complain that a list was released with names of hispanic illegal alines living in utah .
he actually calls it an act of terrorism against the illegal aliens .
this is how these people roll
