sarah sanders does a fantastic job shutting down april reid on the topic of the anthem protest .
reid tries to change the narrative to make the protest about race .
sarah wasn t having it great job sarah ! ryan said the protesting players had said it was not about the flag but about protesting for such things as women s rights and civil rights .
what does the president say when you look at history and see how people love this country but wanted to challenge the system to make it better ?
ryan asked .
i think if we re going to look at history , we should look at the thousands of americans who have given their life to protect that flag , to protect that anthem .
we should be celebrating those people , sanders said , adding she wanted to finish her statement as ryan interrupted.sanders said the white house would always be for celebration of the american flag and that would not change .
just to clarify on that ryan said .
i don t think there s much to clarify , sanders said .
it s pretty black and white .
ryan said that it was a major issue and a racial issue to some , but sanders continued to defend the trump administrations belief that respect should be shown for the flag first.read more : wfb
