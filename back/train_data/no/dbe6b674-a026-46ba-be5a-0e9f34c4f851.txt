beijing ( reuters ) - china must keep up efforts to revolutionize its toilets until the task is completed , state media quoted chinese president xi jinping as saying on monday , amid efforts to boost the domestic tourist industry and improve the quality of life .
xi launched the toilet revolution in 2015 as part of a drive to improve standards of domestic tourism in china , which he said suffers from deep-seated problems of a lack of civility .
the toilet issue is no small thing , it s an important aspect of building civilized cities and countryside , xi said , according to the official xinhua news agency .
as an emerging industry , chinese tourism needs an upgrade in both hardware and software to continue strong growth , xinhua reported xi as saying .
china s national tourism administration recently announced plans to build and upgrade 64,000 toilets between 2018 and 2020 .
but the toilet revolution is about more than just giving sightseers a better holiday experience ; it is also about creating a more civilized society , xinhua added .
since coming to power in 2012 , xi has often visited homes in the countryside and makes checks to see if the locals use pit toilets , besides stressing that village modernization requires sanitary toilets , xinhua said .
in a course-setting speech to a meeting of the ruling communist party in october , xi redefined the principal contradiction facing chinese society for the first time since 1981 , saying the current need was not just for more growth , but more equal growth to satisfy people s desire for a nice life .
china s tourism industry has upgraded 68,000 toilets over the last three years , completing about 19 percent of the task , xinhua said , in what it called universally welcomed renovations .
