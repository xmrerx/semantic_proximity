toronto ( reuters ) - a u.s.-canadian couple freed in pakistan this week , nearly five years after being abducted in afghanistan , reunited with the husband s family on saturday , the associated press reported .
joshua boyle and caitlan coleman arrived with their three children late on friday in toronto , where the husband said one of his children was murdered and his wife had been raped .
citing an email from boyle , the ap reported the family had reached the first true home that the children have ever known after they spent most of friday asking if each subsequent airport was our new house hopefully .
boyle , a canadian , and coleman , an american were kidnapped while backpacking in afghanistan in 2012 by the taliban-allied haqqani network .
pakistani troops rescued the family this week in the northwest of the country , near the afghan border .
the united states has long accused pakistan of failing to fight the haqqani network .
the couple had three children while in captivity .
boyle opened his friday media statement by saying he was delayed due to a medical emergency involving one of his children .
ap , citing boyle s email , said his daughter had a cursory medical exam and hospital staff were enthusiastically insistent that her chances seemed miraculously high based on a quick physical .
boyle made a brief statement at toronto s pearson international airport late on friday , calling on the taliban to provide my family with the justice we are owed .
god willing , this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the haqqani network , he said .
