Donald Trump has just come up with a new way to make his failing administration even worse, and it s going to make most Americans sick to their stomachs.Trump is not only seeking to hire more horrible people to work for him, but what he wants these sought-after employees to do is even worse he wants them to solely focus on his social media promotion.
CNN s Jim Acosta reported this horrifying new addition to the Trump administration on Twitter:Seriously, the last thing this country needs is more people tweeting and posting from Trump s accounts; most of us have already had more than we can stand.
While Dan Scavino has been almost singlehandedly managing Trump s tweets as the narcissistic POTUS comes up with them, having staffers to help him out will certainly allow him to cover more ground.
Acosta reported even more staffing decisions up ahead: The White House is expected to make more high-profile hiring decisions soon as a search is under way for a new communications director.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer is currently handling both jobs, roles that are typically carried out by two staffers.
While more visibility and transparency isn t a bad thing under normal circumstances, most of us know that this is a horrible idea for Trump s administration.
Trump has already been extremely reckless in his social media use just take a look below at some of Trump s security gaffes from this weekend alone:Clearly, giving Trump more exposure is far from a good thing as he s sure to turn the highest office in the country into a circus.
If anything, having more hands in his social media operations is only going to allow him to destroy America s future faster than ever, making us all look incredibly stupid at the same time.Featured image via Matthew Cavanaugh / Getty Images
