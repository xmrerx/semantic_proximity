Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s first entrance to prominence in mainstream American politics was built on the same thing his entire horrific campaign has been built on: bigotry.
Specifically, bigotry against America s first black president, Barack Obama.
Trump led the racist charge that would come to be known as the birther movement, where he and his racist followers claimed that President Obama is not a Christian American who was born in Hawaii, but was instead a Muslim born in Kenya.Of course, these wild claims have been debunked over and over again during Obama s tenure as President, but that still has not convinced The Donald.
In fact, to this day, Trump refuses to admit that he was wrong, and that indeed President Obama was born right here in the United States of America.
On Monday, Trump was asked if his views had changed on President Obama s place of birth, and all he would say to reporters is, I don t talk about it.
Well, Mr. Trump, you spent months upon months publicly worrying over the President s birth certificate, ginning up racism from your fellow bigots who couldn t stand that there s a Black family living in the White House, and no matter what President Obama did including releasing his long form birth certificate as you requested nothing was good enough for you.There s a reason for this.
It s not about any sort of legitimate question regarding President Obama s origins, but about pure, unabashed racism.
And here you are, a few years later, as the standard bearer for one of America s major political parties, and you still are peddling this racist conspiracy theory in an effort to damage President Obama s legacy and deligitimize his time in the office of the presidency.Shame on you, Donald Trump.
And, more to the point, shame on the Republican Party for allowing this man to carry your banner, and then claim that you don t tolerate and endorse racism.
Clearly, you do.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
