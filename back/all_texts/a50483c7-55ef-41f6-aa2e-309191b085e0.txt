Earlier in the week, there were leaked draft executive orders circulating that would strike President Obama s executive order protections for LGBTQ federal workers.
There were also rumors that Donald Trump would sign a sweeping, broadly worded religious freedom bill into law that would effectively legalize discrimination nationwide.
However, Trump and his famously homophobic vice president, Mike Pence, ran into a road block: Trump s kids.
Specifically, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump.Jared and Ivanka have long been seen to be the reasonable, moderating influences that are needed to calm Trump s impulsive, erratic temperament.
It appears that this is what happened here.
Ivanka and Jared see all of the fear and the protests in the streets against Trump, and they feared that there would be even more national and international backlash against Trump s bigotry via executive order.
Therefore, there was a complete reversal on these orders.Of course, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer outright lied when asked about it.
He insisted that these orders were just a couple out of hundreds that were being considered.
Then, of course, a statement was hastily rushed out, saying that the Trump administration is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community.
Considering all of the virulently anti-LGBTQ people Trump has around him namely Mike Pence I don t believe that for so much as a second.
If Ivanka and Jared can keep Trump s hands away from the LGBTQ community for the time being, though, all the better.
Hopefully it will hold until 2018, and we manage to take Congress back, thus crippling the amount of damage Trump and Pence can do until they are out of office.While their reasons were political rather than noble, at this point, it s better than nothing.Featured image via Aaron P.
