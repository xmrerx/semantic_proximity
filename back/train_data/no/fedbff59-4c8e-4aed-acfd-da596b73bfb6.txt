with senate republicans poised to use the nuclear option to confirm supreme court nominee neil gorsuch , will the liberal media hypocritically accuse them of a power grab ?
in 2013 , when then-democratic senate majority leader harry reid did basically the same thing , he was cheered on in the studios of msnbc and cnn.back then msnbc s chris hayes hailed it as an affirmative win for democracy , while his colleague rachel maddow blurted this is a huge freaking deal .
this is like 3-inch headlines .
this is like people who don t even care about politics really ought to care about this .
over on cnn , political analyst paul begala hailed the nakedly partisan maneuver by reid as necessary , whining that republicans had so abused the filibuster that democrats can t take it anymore .
and begala s colleague ron brownstein approved of reid s decision as a forward-thinking move : the idea of requiring a super majority for the president to appoint his nominees just is anachronistic .
but the cable network news hosts and analysts weren t the only ones championing the nuclear option .
on the pages of the los angeles times , reid s move was celebrated in a november 22 editorial democrats bust the filibuster , and good for them .
the times editorial board crowed : we welcome this action not because it represents a comeuppance for arrogant republicans but because filibustering presidential nominees is undemocratic and violates the spirit if not the letter of the constitution , which says that the president shall appoint judges and other officials by and with the advice and consent of the senate not by and with a supermajority of the senate .
the times went on to call it a victory not just for the democrats but for good government .
