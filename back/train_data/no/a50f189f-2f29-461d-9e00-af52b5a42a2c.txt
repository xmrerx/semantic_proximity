thanks to the cato institute we know for sure that government workers are paid waaay too much !
an average of $ 84,153 for government pay is unbelievable !
no wonder the suburbs surrounding dc are some of the wealthiest in the country .
ridiculous ! employees for the federal government earn far more than their counterparts in the private sector , according to a new study by the cato institute.federal workers pay and benefits were 78 percent higher than private employees , who earned an average of $ 52,688 less than public sector workers last year.the study found that federal government workers earned an average of $ 84,153 in 2014 , compared to the private sector s average of $ 56,350 .
cato based its findings on figures from the u.s. bureau of economic analysis ( bea ) .but when adding in benefits pay for federal workers , the difference becomes more dramatic .
federal employees made $ 119,934 in total compensation last year , while private sector workers earned $ 67,246 , a difference of over $ 52,000 , or 78 percent.via : wfb
