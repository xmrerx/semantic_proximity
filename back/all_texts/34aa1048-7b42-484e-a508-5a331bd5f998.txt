You ve got to be kidding!
New York c mon!
We just don t see this lasting for long.
It s a perfect little mini home for one of the homeless people in NYC.
Looking so forward to the exit of Mayor DeBlasio On Tuesday, Hot Octopuss erected what it called a GuyFi booth on 28th Street and 5th Avenue in New York City, where men could, in theory, go to relieve stress.
The company simply put a cloth over a phone booth in what amounted to a marketing gimmick.
Inside was a chair and a laptop.Hot Octopuss was inspired by a Time Out survey, which concluded that 39% of the New York men it questioned admitted to masturbating while at work.

We may be insinuating that these booths could be used in whichever way anyone would like to self soothe, a representative tells Mashable, but the brand is not actively encouraging people to masturbate in public as that is an illegal offense.
The company claims approximately 100 men used the booth on its inaugural day.Read more: Gateway Pundit
