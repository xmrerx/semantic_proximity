As Twitter so perfectly demonstrated, Republican presidential nominee Donald trump has a problem with citing his sources.
One example of this is his recent claim that he met with a top cop in the Chicago Police Department who said that police officers need to have more freedom to be tougher with suspected criminals.
All I know is this, Trump said.
I went to a top police officer in Chicago, who is not the police chief, and I could see by the way he was dealing with his people, he was a rough, tough guy, they respected him greatly.
The claim appears to be a total fabrication by Trump, as the Chicago PD denies any knowledge of such a meeting occurring.The claim provided the Late Show all the material they needed for a hilarious lesson on the importance of being able to cite your sources when making claims on the campaign trail.Colbert says that the Late Show did some digging and found the police officer who Trump claims to have spoken to.
That s when Colbert introduces Officer Rod Johnson to the audience.
Officer Johnson, who is a rough tough cop that isn t afraid to get down and dirty says that he told Trump that, there are some naughty people out there who need to be in cuffs.
The segment concludes with the Officer Johnson tearing off his clothes and dancing to music.
Officer Johnson then says, Stephen, you have the right to remain sexy.
