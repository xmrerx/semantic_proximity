ljubljana ( reuters ) - a centre-left party that has no seats in slovenia s parliament and is led by a former comedian topped an opinion poll published by daily newspaper delo on monday , about six months ahead of an expected general election .
the lista marjana sarca ( lms ) under marjan sarec , mayor of the city of kamnik , drew the support of 15.7 percent with a junior governing coalition party , the social democrats , in second place with 12.6 percent and the leading opposition party , the centre-left slovenian democratic party , with 12.2 percent .
the party of modern centre led by prime minister miro cerar came in sixth with 5.5 percent .
last month , the social democrats led the same poll with 19.8 percent while the lms was not yet included in the survey .
sarec surprised many last month when he was narrowly beaten in a presidential run-off election , gathering about 47 percent to incumbent borut pahor s 53 percent .
analysts said sarec s party , which has so far been active only at local level , could win a parliamentary vote amid general dissatisfaction with the centre-left government , above all its inability to improve the inefficient national health system .
the government of the southeast european country is also under heavy pressure from various public sector unions demanding wage hikes at a time of strong economic growth , expected to be 4.4 percent this year , up from 3.1 percent in 2016 .
pahor will call a general election in the coming months and it is expected to be held in the first half of june .
