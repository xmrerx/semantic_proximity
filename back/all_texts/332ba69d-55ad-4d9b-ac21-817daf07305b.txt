Old Navy posted a completely innocent photo of an interracial family to Twitter over the weekend.
Despite the fact that is 2016, racists almost instantly began attacking Old Navy for helping to support white genocide.
This just proves once again that any type of inclusion in society terrifies racists.Here is the photo that ruined every racists day.
The photo simply shows an interracial family standing together, in the way almost every family seems to pose for an Old Navy advertisement.Oh, happy day!
Our #ThankYouEvent is finally here.

Those who believe in it think that racial equality is a covert attempt to exterminate the white race.
They view any display of racial diversity as a part of a giant brainwashing scheme cooked up by people who hate white people.
Of course, displays of racial diversity are really just showing the reality of the world.
Reality being something these racist trolls seem to have completely distanced themselves from.My family and I will never step into an @OldNavy store again.
This miscegenation junk is rammed down our throats from every direction.

A sick joke where the white guy doesn't realize it's not his kid?

Many people, angry at the racist attacks being launched at Old Navy, began to post photos of their multi-racial families in response.
The images speak volumes as to just how absolutely ridiculous and hate filled these racist trolls actually are.Hey @OldNavy, my family and I thank you for the diversity in this ad!

As Martin Luther King Jr. famously said Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.
Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
What could possibly be more beautiful than family?Thank you once again social media.
You re the only thing that can both destroy a person s faith in humanity and restore it in just a few minutes.Featured image from Twitter
