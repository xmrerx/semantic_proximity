BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has no evidence that Saad al-Hariri is being held against his will by Saudi Arabia and believes that the Lebanese prime minister who resigned last week enjoys freedom of movement, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said on Friday.
We have no evidence that Hariri is being detained in Riyadh and we assume that he chooses where he goes, the spokeswoman said during a regular government news conference.
A government spokesman said Germany shared Saudi Arabia s concerns about Iran s interference in Yemen and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Lebanese group Hezbollah.
