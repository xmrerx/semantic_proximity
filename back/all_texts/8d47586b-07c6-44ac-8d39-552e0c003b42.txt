Canadians are not pleased after White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer refused to rule out Sarah Palin as Donald Trump s choice as Ambassador to Canada.During yet another disastrous press briefing, Spicer suggested to reporters that Trump is considering America s village idiot as the United States Ambassador to Canada.
We have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front, Spicer said when asked about Palin s name being floated for the position.
I m sure at some point we will have soon.
He didn t say that Palin would be chosen, but he didn t deny that she was being considered either.
The thought that Sarah Palin could end up being sent to Canada horrified many Canadians, who proceeded to mock Trump and Palin.Sarah Palin as ambassador?
Well that would show how little Steve Bannon and his pal @realDonaldTrump think of Canada https://t.co/Js4B2Qseah Charlie Angus NDP (@CharlieAngusNDP) February 8, 2017This is entirely because Sarah Palin can see Canada from Alaska, isn t it?

@CharlieAngusNDP @realDonaldTrump Eminently unqualified.
There is no place in Alaska where she could see both Russia and Canada.

No no no.
Alison Smiley (@gwynskid) February 8, 2017Appointing Sarah Palin as the US ambassador to Canada is, like, ultimate trolling.
sara belgium (@sbelg) February 8, 2017Dear Mr. Trump: Rather than appoint Sarah Palin as ambassador to Canada, please bomb us.
Signed, all intelligent life in Canada.

(@brittca) February 9, 2017Sarah Palin is being considered for job as ambassador to Canada.
She s presently on a flight to Europe to meet with us.
#sarahpalin Rob Willcott (@advantagephysio) February 9, 2017Seriously, Sarah Palin is not ambassador material.
She would be a constant embarrassment to both the United States and Canada.
Trump has already made us a laughing stock.
The last thing we need is for Sarah Palin to make things worse.
And she already is by merely being mentioned for the job.If Trump is going to send Palin to another country he should send her to one far, far away so we don t have to hear from her for a long time.
At least he could then say he did one good thing for the nation.Read more:Featured image via screenshot
