lima ( reuters ) - peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski said on wednesday claims he had worked as a consultant for brazilian construction company odebrecht sa [ odbes.ul ] , which is embroiled in an international bribery scandal , were false .
kuczynski also said in a speech broadcast on television that he had never received any campaign donations from odebrecht , which has admitted to paying millions of dollars of bribes in the country .
the statements came a day after local newspaper el comercio reported that the scandal-plagued company hired kuczynski as a consultant a decade ago .
odebrecht sa acknowledged in a plea deal with u.s. and brazilian prosecutors a year ago that it paid $ 29 million in bribes to officials in peru over a decade spanning three presidencies as part of a massive graft scheme across much of latin america and parts of africa .
el comercio reported that marcelo odebrecht , the jailed former head of the company , told prosecutors in brazil that odebrecht had hired kuczynski after he served in the cabinet of former president alejandro toledo , and that the company might have funded his failed 2011 presidential bid .
reuters could not verify what odebrecht told peruvian prosecutors in a meeting last week in curitaba , brazil .
kuczynski had earlier denied both any professional links and receiving campaign donations from odebrecht on twitter .
i did not receive any support from that company in either of my two electoral campaigns , kuczynski said in his speech on wednesday .
it is fundamental that we all fight against corruption , and i am committed to that fight .
