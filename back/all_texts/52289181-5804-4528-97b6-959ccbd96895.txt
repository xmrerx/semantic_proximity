An unknown man saw some children playing on the side of a street with toy guns.
This normally would be no big deal.
It happens all across the nation more times than can be counted every day.
However, in this case, the kids and the person talking to them were people of color.
That really does change everything.The man approached the kids and pleaded with them to get off the streets and take their toy guns indoors to play with them.
He was so concerned that he even offered them money to do it.
The reason he was so worried is because he was afraid that the police would come by and shoot them.
The man didn t seem to be trying to frighten the children, but when they heard what could happen the look on their faces said it all.Watch the look on the kids faces when they hear what could happen to them below:// < !

These are two kids who have no malicious intent and were not doing anything wrong, and they could have ended up dead due to aggressive police.
White kids run around with toy guns constantly in America.
Yes, it is possible that a cop might arrest or shoot a white kid with a toy gun, but we know that a cop will arrest or shoot a black kid with a toy gun.
Tamir Rice is a perfect example of the kill first, ask questions later attitude that police have adopted towards people of color.
Tamir was only 12 years old, but police shot him dead in under 5 seconds of arriving on the scene where he was playing with a toy gun.
They didn t even pause to evaluate the situation.
It is so bad that just walking down the street is enough to be shot 16 times if you are not white, in the case of LaQuan McDonald.It s great if this adult s intervention helped these kids on this day to keep them safe, but this is not the state in which we should make them have to live.
Instead of them being required to lives in a way to be more compatible with raging, predator cops, how about we force our police to remember what protect and serve actually means.featured image via video screen capture
