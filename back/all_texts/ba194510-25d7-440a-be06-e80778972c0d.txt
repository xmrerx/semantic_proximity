Donald Trump has p*ssed off so many people, it s really hard to keep track (unless you re The Donald himself, in which case you ll never let it go).
One person he s irritated arguably more than others is Mexico s former president, Vicente Fox, who has being railing against Trump since the very day the disgraced presumptive GOP nominee made his horrifically offensive rapist and drug dealer comments about Mexican immigrants.Fox reminded everyone that he still hates Trump with a passion, and has even come up with some creative nicknames for the business mogul.
In an interview on the Kickass Politics podcast, Fox told host Ben Mathis: He is the ugly American.
He is the hated gringo because he s attacking all of us.
He s offending all of us.
Fox also reaffirmed the fact that Mexico would have nothing to do with Trump s idiotic proposed border wall.
Restating his opposition to Trump s wall just as strongly as he did the first time, Fox said: I m not going to pay for that f*cking wall.
And please don t take out the f*cking full word.
Here s the Facebook post with Fox and Mathis, sending a brilliant message to Trump for all of us:During the interview, Fox also had some other amazing choice words for Trump such as crazy and false prophet.
He also compared Trump to Latin American demagogues who destroy economies and warned that Trump s proposals could start another war.While many of Trump s opponents have eventually cozied up to the candidate (cough cough Ben Carson) and learned to be somewhat civil with him, Fox is making no apologies and wants to make sure that everyone knows where he stands when it comes to the reality TV star.It s clear that Trump has f*cked with the wrong guy and Fox wants to make sure that Trump knows it.
Fox warned: Don t play around with us.
We can jump walls.
We can swim rivers.
And we can defend ourselves.
