kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - a chinese submarine has docked in malaysia , the second such visit to the southeast asian country this year , as western powers fret over china s expanding reach in the south china sea .
china claims nearly all the south china sea , through which an estimated $ 3 trillion in international trade passes each year .
brunei , malaysia , the philippines and taiwan also have claims .
tensions between china and malaysia over their overlapping claims , however , appear to have eased after malaysia agreed in november to buy four chinese naval vessels and pledged with beijing to handle south china sea disputes bilaterally .
the royal malaysian navy confirmed the visit by the chinese submarine , which docked at the sepanggar naval base in the state of sabah in borneo between friday and monday .
rmn chief admiral ahmad kamarulzaman ahmad badaruddin said it was standard international procedure to welcome visits by foreign navy vessels , based on each nation s request and upon diplomatic clearance .
this is part of our efforts to enhance defense diplomacy and strengthening bilateral relations , he told reuters .
the submarine was escorted by a surface ship from the pla navy and was returning to china after conducting escort missions in the gulf of aden , according to defense magazine jane s 360 , which first reported the submarine s docking .
in january , a chinese submarine docked in sepanggar , only the second confirmed visit of a chinese submarine to a foreign port , according to state media .
chinese warships have also been calling at ports in pakistan , bangladesh and myanmar , unnerving regional rival india .
