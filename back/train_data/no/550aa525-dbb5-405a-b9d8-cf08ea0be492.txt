harare ( reuters ) - in the annals of missed stories , it ranks up there .
when wednesday s edition of the herald , zimbabwe s main state newspaper , hit the streets , zimbabweans were surprised to learn that talk of ructions between president robert mugabe s ruling zanu-pf party and military chief constantino chiwenga were unfounded .
zanu-pf unfazed by chiwenga , the herald declared on its front page , reporting on the party s denunciation of the military chief as a traitor the previous day .
most people in harare had spent the night glued to social media and the internet for updates on a coup slowly unfolding against 93-year-old mugabe , zimbabwe s leader of the last 37 years .
just after 4 a.m. , an army spokesman in camouflage fatigues appeared on state media to announce that the army had seized power .
the final line of his declaration : to the media , we urge you report fairly and responsibly .
