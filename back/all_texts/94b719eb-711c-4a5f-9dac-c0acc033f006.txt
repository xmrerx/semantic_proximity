Police in Portland just moved from watching a May Day demonstration to calling this a riot:Glass bottles and cans are being thrown at police officers and rioters are literally destroying Portland Antifa is officially out of control Arrests are being made and noise grenades were set off by Portland police Cop cars have been destroyed and firemen are all over the city putting out fires set by the Antifa thugs A @PortlandPolice car's window smashed by rioters pic.twitter.com/B5HMiRWCwn Andrew Dymburt (@DymburtNews) May 2, 2017Thanks to brave citizen journalists like Mike Bivins, we can see the reality of what s happening in Portand This was happening in Paris earlier today so this time it s America s reality check.
Don t think this won t eventually head your way.Law and order needs to rule the day Numerous people have been arrested so let s hope this simmers down now Riot Cops rush in and fire fighter paramedics put out the fire.
Can't tell if arrests made.
