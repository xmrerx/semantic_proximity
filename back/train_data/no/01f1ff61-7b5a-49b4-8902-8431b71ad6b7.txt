barcelona ( reuters ) - spanish authorities on sunday pursued efforts to block an independence vote in catalonia , seizing campaign materials as the chief prosecutor said jailing the region s top politician could not be ruled out .
the government in the northeastern region is intent on holding a referendum on october 1 that will ask voters whether they support secession from spain , a ballot madrid has declared illegal .
in a raid on a warehouse in the province of barcelona on sunday , police confiscated around 1.3 million leaflets and other campaign materials promoting the vote issued by the catalan government .
the haul was the largest in a series of similar raids , the interior ministry said in a statement .
spanish prosecutors , who have ordered police to investigate any efforts to promote the plebiscite , said last week that officials engaged in any preparations for it could be charged with civil disobedience , abuse of office and misuse of public funds .
more than 700 catalan mayors gathered in barcelona on saturday to affirm their support for it .
asked if arresting regional government head carles puigdemont was an option if preparations continued , spain s chief public prosecutor said in an interview : we could consider it because the principal objective is to stop the referendum going ahead .
i won t rule out completely the option of seeking jail terms ...
it could happen under certain circumstances , jose manuel maza was quoted as also telling sunday s edition of newspaper el mundo .
the catalan parliament passed a law enabling the referendum early last month , but spain s constitutional court suspended it the next day .
pro-independence activists have said they plan to distribute campaign leaflets promoting the referendum on sunday evening in barcelona .
although polls show less than half of catalonia s 5.5 million voters support independence , most in the wealthy northeastern region want the chance to vote on the issue .
