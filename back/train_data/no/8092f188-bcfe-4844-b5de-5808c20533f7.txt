guatemala city ( reuters ) - guatemalan president jimmy morales said on sunday he had given instructions to move the central american country s embassy in israel to jerusalem , a few days after his government backed the united states in a row over the city s status .
in a short post on his official facebook account , morales said he decided to move the embassy from tel aviv after talking to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on sunday .
this month u.s. president donald trump recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel , reversing decades of u.s. policy and upsetting the arab world and western allies .
the status of jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between israel and the palestinians , who want east jerusalem as their capital .
the international community does not recognize israeli sovereignty over the entire city , home to sites holy to the muslim , jewish and christian religions .
on thursday , 128 countries defied trump by backing a non-binding u.n. general assembly resolution calling for the united states to drop its recognition of jerusalem .
guatemala and neighboring honduras were two of only a handful of countries to join the united states and israel in voting against the resolution on jerusalem .
the united states is an important source of assistance to guatemala and honduras , and trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that supported the u.n. resolution .
morales , a former television comedian with an important base of conservative christian support , earlier this year became embroiled in a bitter spat with the united nations when a u.n.-backed anti-corruption body in guatemala tried to impeach him .
although morales avoided impeachment , he failed in an attempt to expel the head of the body , the international commission against impunity in guatemala , after criticism from the united nations , the united states and the european union .
