seoul ( reuters ) - south korean nuclear experts , checking for contamination after north korea s sixth and largest nuclear test , said on friday they have found minute traces of radioactive xenon gas but that it was too early to specify its source .
the nuclear safety and security commission ( nssc ) said it had been conducting tests on land , air and water samples since shortly after north korea s nuclear test on sunday .
the statement said the commission was analyzing how the xenon entered south korean territory and will make a decision at a later time whether the material is linked to north korea s nuclear test .
xenon is a naturally occurring , colorless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights .
but the nssc said it had detected xenon-133 , a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has in the past been linked to north korea s nuclear tests .
there was no chance the xenon will have an impact on south korea s territory or population , the statement said .
