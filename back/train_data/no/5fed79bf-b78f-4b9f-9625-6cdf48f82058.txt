london ( reuters ) - british police released a new image on wednesday in a fresh bid to trace a male jogger who appeared to push a woman into the path of an oncoming bus on a busy london street four months ago .
video footage of the apparently callous incident on putney bridge , southwest london , has been repeatedly screened on british television but the runner has yet to be found .
footage shows him jog past one man on the bridge on may 5 before knocking into the 33-year-old victim .
she tumbled head-first into the path of an oncoming bus , which managed to swerve out of her way , missing her by inches .
the new cctv still was taken from the bus , and shows a white man in a gray top and dark shorts .
police said he came back the other way across the bridge 15 minutes later but did not acknowledge the victim when she tried to speak to him .
images of this alarming incident have been circulated widely and we continue to work through the information received to identify the man responsible , said detective sergeant chris griffith .
two men arrested last month in connection with the incident have both been released without charge .
