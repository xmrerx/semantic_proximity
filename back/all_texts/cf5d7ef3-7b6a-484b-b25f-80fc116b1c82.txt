The Obama Administration has told states around the nation in no uncertain terms that they will not be able to continue to discriminate against transgender students in schools.
The language used by Attorney General Loretta Lynch regarding transgender rights was strong and left no room for debate.
Of course, bigoted lawmakers around the country are scrambling for a reason to continue enshrining their hate for LGBT people into law, no matter what it takes.
One such lawmaker is Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.Patrick appeared on Fox News The Kelly File and debated Megyn Kelly regarding the issue, and kept babbling on about supposed sexual predators dressing up like women to get access to little girls.
Host Megyn Kelly cut his idiocy off at the knees, though, when Patrick kept repeating this tired talking point of bigots everywhere.
Kelly said: A lot of sex offenders are men who molest men, little boys.
Why do they need to sneak into the girls room?
Patrick didn t address this point, but instead ranted on about men in a bathroom with his 8-year-old granddaughter.
Kelly cut him off with this one as well, saying: But what if a man looks like a woman and she would never notice him?
Patrick then went on to say, Megyn, you re missing the but Kelly cut him off completely and ended the interview, saying, No, I don t think I m missing anything.
Kudos to Megyn Kelly for owning this obvious anti-LGBT bigot.
