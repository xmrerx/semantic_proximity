this isn t just any church organization , this is a church organization that takes in $ 45 million in taxpayer funds every year !
why do we give them so much money ?
because they re bringing mostly muslim refugees into our country where they ll get housing , food , clothing , education and spending money with more of our tax dollars .
they ll also be fast-tracked to citizenship .
what s the end goal ?
the fundamental transformation of america ohio peace and justice groups getting ready to break the law and hide aliens from obama illegal alien raids , click here.the recent obama administration order to round up illegal aliens ( a tiny number ! )
and deport them is simply a ploy to fire up the no borders movement , the democrat base , in this all important election year.church world service will be hiding illegal aliens ! here is a story about the hard left church world service , a federal refugee resettlement contractor , which uses $ 45 million of your dollars every year to change america by changing the people , is setting up hiding places throughout america where illegal aliens can be placed out of the reach of federal ice agents.there should be a law , if you break federal immigration law , you lose your federal funding ( come on wimps in congress !
) .they want to resurrect the glory days ( as they saw them ) where churches broke the law and helped central americans get into america and then hid them until they could be spread out to towns across the us .
it was called the sanctuary movement .
* * * it is so apparent that this deportation order is part of a democrat strategy , most likely cooked up in the white house , because ( have you noticed ! )
no one blasts obama personally ( as they would if this were george bush or donald trump ) .religious groups and activists vowed wednesday to offer refuge to illegal immigrants who are the targets of ongoing federal raids meant to combat a new wave of border-crossing from central america.the announcement recalled the sanctuary movement of the 1980s that provided safe haven to several thousand people fleeing civil wars in el salvador and guatemala , with churches in los angeles , chicago and other cities sometimes filled with people seeking asylum in the united states.at the start of the year , the obama administration launched a large-scale effort targeting those who have already been ordered to leave the country .
about 120 adults and children have been apprehended in raids in several states.central american illegal aliens are not refugees .
they do not fit the long-understood definition that a refugee or asylum seeker must prove they would be persecuted if they returned to their home country.escaping poverty or run-of-the-mill crime is not persecution , but these no borders activists have been for years attempting to blur the definition .
and , that is mostly because when someone is defined as a refugee all welfare goodies flow their way and they can then bring in the family they left behind .
( of course the wapo isn t going to explain any of that to its readers !
) .the effort , which is expected to include several hundred more apprehensions , has drawn sharp criticism from those who advocate for undocumented immigrants .
they argue that central americans who are entering the country illegally should be offered the same protections extended to syrian refugees.via : refugee resettlement watchhere is the list of churches affiliated with the radical church world services group : member communionsafrican methodist episcopal church african methodist episcopal zion church alliance of baptists american baptist churches usa armenian church of america ( including diocese of california ) christian church ( disciples of christ ) christian methodist episcopal church church of the brethren community of christ the coptic orthodox church in north america ecumenical catholic communion the episcopal church evangelical lutheran church in america friends united meeting greek orthodox archdiocese of america hungarian reformed church in america international council of community churches korean presbyterian church in america malankara orthodox syrian church mar thoma church moravian church in america national baptist convention of america national baptist convention , u.s.a. , inc. national missionary baptist convention of america orthodox church in america patriarchal parishes of the russian orthodox church in the u.s.a. philadelphia yearly meeting of the religious society of friends polish national catholic church of america presbyterian church ( usa ) progressive national baptist convention , inc. reformed church in america serbian orthodox church in the u.s.a. and canada the swedenborgian church syrian orthodox church of antioch ukrainian orthodox church in america united church of christ the united methodist church
