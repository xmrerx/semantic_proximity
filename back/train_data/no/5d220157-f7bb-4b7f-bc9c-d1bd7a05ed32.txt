immediately after president trump s speech about the horrible manchester terror attack , the left decided to twist his words .
twitter and other social media be can saying what he said was unpresidential .
nice try by the left but you have to hear the entire context in which he spoke !
he called the terrorists evil losers in life : he s so right !
this tactic is an effort to change the narrative to make these guys evil losers in life .watch : trump speaks out about # manchesterbombing , calls terrorists evil losers https : //t.co/vvtrrekmgj pic.twitter.com/42un1h5q1j today ( @ todayshow ) may 23 , 2017woopi goldberg has the nerve to claim that president trump was not presidential enough in his comments about the evil loser in life who slaughtered children .
she goes on to claim that people complained because obama was too articulate for people .
this is laughable !
obama was a chameleon depending on what crowd he was talking to .
he would go from arrogant to slang with the switch of who was in attendance .
would you rather have a president who speaks from the heart or someone who s a complete phony ? https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kywekrwkdtcisn t it funny that these women are more concerned about the semantics of what we call terrorists than the horrible crime committed .
