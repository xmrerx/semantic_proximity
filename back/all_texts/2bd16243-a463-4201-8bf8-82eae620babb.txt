HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s incoming president Emmerson Mnangagwa has called on citizens to remain peaceful and desist from any form of vengeful retribution , days after Robert Mugabe resigned from power.
Mnangagwa s supporters were angered by his dismissal early this month, a move that triggered the military to intervene.
Some of the supporters have been calling for unspecified action against the G40 group that backed Mugabe and his wife.
