london ( reuters ) - saudi arabia supports u.s. president donald trump s stance on iran after he decided not to certify that tehran is complying with a nuclear accord , saudi foreign minister adel al-jubeir said on tuesday .
u.s. president donald trump broke ranks with other major powers this month by refusing to formally certify that tehran is complying with the deal , even though international inspectors say it is .
jubeir said the nuclear deal had shortcomings , and that he agreed with trump s assessment that iran was working to destabilise the region and was funding militant organisations .
sunni muslim saudi arabia , a u.s. ally , has been at loggerheads with iran , a shi ite muslim country , for decades , and the countries have fought a long-running proxy war in the middle east .
( iran s behaviour ) is not acceptable , and there will be consequences to the iranians .
this is what president trump has said , and we are very supportive of that , jubeir said at a conference in london .
following trump s decision , u.s. congress has until mid-december to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the pact .
jubeir said that new sanctions on iran would be welcome , and that a delay could mean that by the time sanctions had impact , iran could have already developed a dozen nuclear bombs .
the international community needs to support those ( sanctions ) in order to send a very strong message to iran that your behaviour , your nefarious activities , have consequences , jubeir said .
iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb .
