london ( reuters ) - iran will reopen all its border crossings with iraq s kurdistan region in the coming days , lifting restrictions imposed after last month s kurdish vote in favor of independence , its chief of staff said on monday .
the announcement comes a day after iraqi kurdish leader masoud barzani said he would give up his position as president on nov. 1 , after the independence referendum he championed backfired and triggered military action by the baghdad .
after the vote , iraqi troops were ordered by the country s prime minister haider al-abadi to take control of areas claimed by both baghdad and the kurdish government .
iran , which has its own kurdish minority , also opposes independence for iraqi kurds , and at the request of baghdad closed its borders with the kurdish region in northern iraq and halted all flights there and back .
border restrictions between iran and iraq s kurdish region will be lifted in coming days , iran s chief of staff major general mohammad baqeri was quoted as saying by isna tehran already re-opened the bashmagh crossing last week .
baqeri also said if kurdistan implemented its plan to break away from iraq , there would be bloodshed in iraq and neighboring countries would be affected .
abadi wants to take control of the border crossings between the kurdish region and turkey , iran and syria , including one through which an oil export pipeline crosses into turkey .
