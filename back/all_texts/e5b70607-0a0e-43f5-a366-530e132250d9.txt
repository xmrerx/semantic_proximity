Wow!
This couldn t have happened to a nicer guy (sarcasm!)
Democrats waisted no time in calling for an investigation into another groper amongst them.
The ladies are now turning the tables and coming out after al Franken for his history of groping.
Who knew?
Why now?
we hope the former comedian and currently nasty politician gets what s coming to him Senator Al Franken faced swift and bipartisan condemnation Thursday and multiple calls for an ethics investigation after a Los Angeles radio broadcaster and former model accused him of forcibly kissing and groping her in 2006.Franken first issued a brief apology and said he didn t recall the incident the way Leeann Tweeden did, but he later issued a longer apology: There s no excuse he said.
He welcomed the ethics investigation, saying he will gladly cooperate.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) said he hopes there soon will be an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee, which has the authority to recommend expelling a senator.
Sexual harassment is never acceptable and must not be tolerated, Schumer said in a statement.TO TOP IT ALL OFF, AN MSNBC ANCHOR DEFENDED HIS ACTIONS AS MOCK GROPING :MSNBC's Kasie Hunt claims Franken was "mock-groping," not "groping" not how Leeann Tweeden described it.
