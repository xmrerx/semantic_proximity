dakar ( reuters ) - the liberty party that placed third in the first round of liberia s presidential elections on monday submitted a complaint to the elections commission ( nec ) , calling for it to annul the result won by former soccer star george weah , the document showed .
if the contents of the liberty party ( lp ) complaint , which was seen by reuters , are deemed valid , it could force a re-run of what is expected to be the west african country s first democratic transfer of power since 1944 .
its candidate lawyer charles brumskine placed third after weah placed first and the ruling party s joseph boakai second .
the complaint was filed by the presidential and vice-presidential candidates as well as all representative candidates of the liberty party .
international observers , including the carter center and the national democratic institute , said they did not see any major problems with the vote .
in its complaint , the liberty party alleges various problems ranging from the late opening of polls to the absence of queue controllers but also included fraud allegations , including by nec officials .
nec officials were not immediately available outside of normal office hours .
in one case , the lp alleges that an nec officer had pre-marked ballots in his possession .
in another , the lp said an official misrepresented the number of ballots for the party s candidate .
these elections were characterized by gross irregularities and fraud , which undermined the integrity of the elections and deprived thousands of liberians of their constitutional right to vote , the document said .
the second round run-off is scheduled for next month .
