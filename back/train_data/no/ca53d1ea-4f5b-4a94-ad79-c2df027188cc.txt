kigali ( reuters ) - rwandan police have arrested supporters of jailed opposition figure victoire ingabire who they said were planning to join an armed group in a neighboring country .
ingabire was jailed for 15 years in 2012 for conspiring to form an armed group to undermine the government and for seeking to minimize the 1994 genocide .
among the seven people arrested was boniface twagirimana , the vice president of ingabire s party , and leonille gasengayire , a member of the party - fdu-inkingi - which has never been registered as an official political movement , the police said on wednesday .
both have in the past accused the government of killing or being behind the disappearance of party members , which the government denies .
ingabire returned from exile in the netherlands to contest a presidential election in january 2010 but was barred from standing after being accused of genocide denial .
more than 800,000 people were killed in rwanda when an ethnic hutu-led government and ethnic militias went on a 100-day massacre .
afterwards , president paul kagame , who won a third term last month , was lauded for bringing economic improvements but he has faced increasing accusations of widespread human rights abuses , suppression of the political opposition and muzzling the media .
