tokyo ( reuters ) - japan s coast guard on thursday boarded a north korean fishing boat near a japanese island where the crew said they had taken shelter from rough seas , the latest in a series of north korean vessels in distress drifting into japanese waters .
the wooden boat was towed nearer the northern island of hokkaido for inspection , a coast guard spokesman said .
authorities had yet to decide what to do with the vessel and the ten fishermen on board .
at this point , it is still too early to say what we will do , he said .
experts say food shortages may be driving fishermen to risk taking their small boats to more dangerous waters closer to japan .
the encounters have attracted greater attention amid tension in the region over north korea s weapons programs and its latest missile test on wednesday .
there has been no suggestion that the fishermen may be defectors from the impoverished , tightly controlled country which has fired two missiles over japan in recent tests and regularly threatens to destroy the united states .
on monday , eight bodies believed to be of north koreans , which had been partly reduced to skeletons , were found in a small wooden ship washed up on a beach on japan s northwest coast .
two other bodies were found at the weekend on the western shore of the sea of japan island of sado , with life jackets displaying korean lettering .
last week , police in northern japan found eight north korean men who said they landed after claiming their vessel had lost power and run into trouble .
on thursday , the coast guard issued an advisory to shipping about a half-sunken wooden boat floating in waters close to sado .
