Watch for it Why in the world is liberal journalist John Harwood moderating Wednesday s Republican debate?
And where the heck is his conservative media partner?
Wednesday night s debate will be hosted by CNBC at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.
It will be moderated by Harwood along with CNBC s Carl Quintanilla and Becky Quick and is supposed to focus on economic issues, though previous CNBC debates have strayed far from that topic.
