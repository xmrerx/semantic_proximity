Ivanka Trump s father, the man who calls himself President of the United States, obviously follows world events even if it seems like he follows them so he can exploit them.
His children, Ivanka included, tend to either follow him or walk in lockstep with him on virtually everything.
While there s absolutely nothing wrong with expressing grief over Syria s president, Bahsar al-Assad s decision to murder innocent people including children, there are times when the irony of such expression is just too much to handle.Ivanka tweeted the following anger and dismay over Assad s gas attack on his own people earlier this week:Heartbroken and outraged by the images coming out of Syria following the atrocious chemical attack yesterday.
Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 5, 2017One man had the wherewithal to point out the horrific irony in that outrage:Wait until you find out that your Dad signed an executive order banning those same people from entering the United States https://t.co/7JHPCmJ8NF Michael Cohen (@speechboy71) April 6, 2017We d be in a far better position to justify total outrage over this if we d been behaving in a humanitarian manner towards Syria in the first place.
We, or rather, Trump, haven t been.
At the same time Trump is lamenting children who died at the hands of a brutal dictator, he s prohibiting those same children from coming to the U.S. because of some misguided fear about a Trojan horse of terrorism.Others are less-than impressed with her tweet too, in light of her father s attitude towards refugees.
Considering we may have just made more refugees, the hypocrisy stands out in starker relief than ever:@speechboy71 @kimchi1380 She doesn t care.
Refugees can t afford to buy her clothes Virginia Bourne (@Southviabirth) April 6, 2017@speechboy71 @rohaniroop @IvankaTrump Ivanka had to say something she didn t want to look complicit.

Alt.
Sean Spicer (@AltUSPressSec) April 5, 2017@IvankaTrump You do realize it s YOUR policy that let this happen.
This kind of statement is the definition of complicit.

Chris Beasley (@logan48227) April 5, 2017@speechboy71 @MalcolmNance @IvankaTrump What the hell do you or ur father care about those poor refugee?
U ban refugees fleeing for their lives!
Your words are empty!
tula holmes (@tulaholmes) April 6, 2017@speechboy71 @JoyAnnReid How many of those women, children, and babies could have been saved if allowed refuge in the US and their allies?
Deborah Carmody (@smokerisesOH) April 6, 2017@speechboy71 @JoyAnnReid @IvankaTrump If you didn t fight against Daddy s refugee ban or Jr s poison skittles comment, you are #Complicit friedpearl (@friedpearl) April 6, 2017@speechboy71 @007kzman Oh, no.
She s just heartbroken enough as long as they re not here.
If they are here, she s less than enthused.
Imagine This (@HeyThatsMyPen) April 6, 2017@speechboy71 @IvankaTrump Hey, Ivanka, if you re so concerned, are you going to expedite refugee visas for these poor kids??
Betcha don t. V. Williams (@gecko46) April 6, 2017Unless she openly stands up to her father when he makes things harder for people like Syrian refugees everyone s right.
She has a chance to have some real influence for good and she s squandering it this way.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images
