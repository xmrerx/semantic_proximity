One of Florida s most infamous gun shop owners is yet again making headlines this time for selling targets that have the faces of President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on them.Last year, Florida Gun Supply owner Andy Hallinan raised eyebrows by banning Muslims from his store, when he made this announcement via a YouTube video: I have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety of all patriots in my community, and so effective immediately, I m declaring Florida Gun Supply as a Muslim-free zone.
I will not arm and train those who wish to do harm to my fellow patriots.
This of course, got the attention of the racist murderer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman.
Naturally, the two gun nuts joined forces to sell confederate flag paintings through Hallinan s store so that Zimmerman could pay his living expenses.
Apparently racism and hate speech works, because Zimmerman was able to make $100,000 on a painting so horrible a first grader could have done better.Now, Hallinan s latest stunt is an idea all of his own.
On his website, BernieTargets.com, he is selling the targets with the three Democrats faces on them for $4.99, marked down from $9.99.Bernietargets.com Hallinan has several other classy products for sale on the site, such as a Muslim-free zone vehicle sticker , an ISIS hunting permit , a Mohammed target , a Muslim-free yard sign , Liberal tears gun oil and a Hillary for prison 2016 yard sign .If this guy is a fan of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, that wouldn t be a surprise at all.
Hallinan clearly agrees with Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric, and is probably right on board with The Donald s horrific proposal to ban all Muslims from coming into the country which is pretty much what Hallinan tried to do on a smaller scale with his store last year.This type of xenophobia, and blatant hate toward those with different religious (and political views) is so dangerous.
Having targets with the faces of President Barack Obama (who Trump has repeatedly implied is Muslim) and this year s Democratic candidates is truly blurring the line between parody and inciting violence.Featured image is a screenshot
