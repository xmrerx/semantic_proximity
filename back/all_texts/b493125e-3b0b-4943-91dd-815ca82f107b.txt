Friday morning, after public outcry and unprecedented bipartisan urging from Congress, President Obama ordered an official review into election-related hacking over what involvement Russia had in influencing the presidential election in November.In the span of just about 24 hours, the CIA succeeded in confirming that the allegations of Russian interference with the presidential election are indeed fact.
Russia is guilty of election-related hacking, and Trump is scared out of his tiny little mind right now because as The Washington Post reports, Russia not only hacked the election, but they did so with the specific intent to help Trump win and didn t release information on Republicans they likely obtained.
It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected, said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators.
That s the consensus view.
Of course, like he always does, Trump calls foul and dismisses the CIA s findings: These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, the statement begins.
The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history, it continues (wrongly, I might add).
It s now time to move on and Make America Great Again!'
It sounds like what Trump meant to say was, It s now time to move on and Make America Russia Again!'
