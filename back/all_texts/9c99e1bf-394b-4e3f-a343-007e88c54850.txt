The Trump presidential campaign has already faced a rocky road to the nomination, including the now-defused threat of a contested convention, as well as widespread rejection of the nominee from the party elite (he has had the support of the rank-and-file).Now a stomach-turning criminal charge has surfaced.A Donald Trump delegate headed to the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland has instead been indicted on serious charges.A Donald Trump delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention has been indicted in Maryland on federal charges that include using a minor to make child pornography, illegal possession of a machine gun and illegal transport of explosives.Caleb Andrew Bailey, 30, from Waldorf, Maryland, was indicted late Wednesday, according to a release from the Department of Justice.Bailey was listed on the Maryland Secretary of State website as an elected Trump delegate to the party meeting.The Justice Department said he allegedly tried to send ammunition and weapons through the mail to someone in Wisconsin.
When they searched his home they found a machine gun.
In the indictment that came down, the Department said Bailey attempted to use and did use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct to produce child pornography.
Previously, the Trump campaign had enlisted the support of a white supremacist as a delegate in California.
William Johnson is the head of the white nationalist American Freedom Party and financed pro-Trump robocalls during the primaries.While the Trump campaign first claimed they had enlisted Johnson s support due to a database error, they had to rely on him to voluntarily step down since the deadline had already passed for him to be withdrawn.The Huffington Post reported that the Trump campaign had not responded to them about the allegations against Bailey in Maryland, and it was unclear what they would do about his status as a Trump representative at the convention.Featured image via Flickr
