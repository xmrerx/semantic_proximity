this is what happens when making abortion legal becomes more important than the threat of the elimination of your faith a new poll sponsored by the los angeles jewish journal reveals that a strong plurality of american jews support the iran nuclear deal , 49 % to 31 % .
that compares to much smaller support among americans in general , who split 28 % to 24 % for the deal .
when asked if congress should vote for the deal , most american jews say yes , 53 % to 35 % ( as compared to a 41 % to 38 % among americans in general ) .
the poll included 1,000 adults , split between jews and non-jews , and was conducted via telephone ( and cell phone ) from july 16 through july 20.the results among american jews contrast with polls among israeli jews , who are strongly against the iran deal .
a recent poll of israeli jews indicated that 78 % believe the iran deal endangers the country .
a strong plurality of israeli jews favored a military strike against iran , 47 % to 35 % .
the rift , says jewish journal columnist shmuel rosner , is the first damaging impact of a troubling agreement with iran .
one obvious reason for the split is that israeli jews are directly exposed to the threat of a nuclear iran .
american jews , for whom israel is an issue of diminishing importance , view the iran deal primarily through the prism of domestic politics .
aside from blacks , american jews are the most loyal supporters of president barack obama.rosner notes : jews like most other humans tend to understand the world in a way that is compatible with their beliefs.if they support obama , they believe obama .
if they believe obama , they also believe him when he says that the deal is good for israel s security .
rosner s conclusion is supported by one of the most interesting results of the poll : among those american jews who don t know whether the iran deal will make israel safer , 66 % favor the deal while only 8 % do not.via : breitbart news
