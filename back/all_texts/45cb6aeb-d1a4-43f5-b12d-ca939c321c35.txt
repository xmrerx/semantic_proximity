The seven-story complex was completely destroyed and the heat blew out windows at nearby office towers.At Wednesday s hearing, a witness testified that Abdulwali bragged at a party about burning the building and said he did it because he was angry about the police killing of an unarmed black man in Missouri.Via: Houston ChronicleThe witness, Popaul Tshimanga, said he and Abdulwali attended a party a week later.
Tshimanga said Abdulwali ranted about the August 2014 killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He was mad, Tshimanga said, adding that the defendant said he burned the building near a freeway and didn t like the way the cops were killing black people.
Abdulwali s former roommate, Edwyn Gomez, has told investigators that Abdulwali spoke passionately about the protests in Ferguson after Brown s shooting and about wanting vengeance.
Cops kill my people, Gomez recalled Abdulwali saying.
We should go do this, we should go burn some (expletive) down.
We should go break some windows.
