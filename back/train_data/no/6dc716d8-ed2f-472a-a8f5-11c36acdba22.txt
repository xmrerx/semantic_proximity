hillary clinton is a professional panderer .
there is no vote she won t attempt to secure , no matter the cost .
in reality , her desire to gain the vote of young women in america will only harm her , as her call to stop the sexual assaults against women on campuses across america only shines a light one of the ugliest aspects of the clinton crime syndicate .
bill s pattern of sexual abuse , and hillary s willingness to sit back and watch will undoubtedly to come back to haunt them .
anyone who thought hillary could get away with this phony compassion for women who are truly sexual victims , underestimates the disdain that women on both sides of the aisle have for her and her serial rapist husband.articles have now appeared in two left of center websites , vox and slate , noting that it s hard to dismiss ms. ( anita ) broderick ( claims of sexual assault by bill clinton ) given the new progressive consensus on believing victims .
well the injunction to believe victims gained currency among progressives because of a potent mix of gender theory and advocacy statistics.the theory came from the legal scholar catharine mackinnon , who taught that : feminism is built on believing women s accounts of sexual use and abuse and by men .
the statistics were supplied by activist researchers who claimed that women almost never lie about sexual assault .
now those activist statistics have been shredded , but among progressives , the doctrine of sexual victim infallibility , that lived on .
but if victims are infallible , then those they accuse , must be presumed guilty .
and that brings us to the clintons .
hillary clinton has signed on to that theory .
