u.s. rep. eddie bernice johnson ( d-dallas ) argued the beheading of two american journalists by isis does not justify u.s. airstrikes into syria thursday .
during an interview on capitol hill , johnson said the slayings of james foley and steven sotloff should not lead to bombing isis forces in syria .
we were on their ground .
it was not in the u.s .
i do think we need to protect americans wherever they are .
but americans also need to be careful where they are , said johnson .
the dallas democrat also said president obama does not need congressional authority to escalate the fight against isis .
but she feels he would be wise to seek approval from the u.s. house and senate .
