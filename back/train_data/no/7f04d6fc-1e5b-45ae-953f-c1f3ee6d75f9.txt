ankara ( reuters ) - turkish jets struck a target in northern iraq on wednesday , killing 13 suspected kurdish pkk fighters , the armed forces said in a statement .
in an air strike in northern iraq , 13 armed members of a separatist terrorist organization preparing for an attack were neutralized , the statement said , using a term which turkey uses to describe kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) militants .
the pkk has been waging an insurgency in turkey s mainly kurdish southeast since the 1980s , but also has bases across the border in northern iraq which turkey regularly targets .
turkish troops are also conducting a joint military exercise with iraqi soldiers near their border after monday s referendum for kurdish independence in northern iraq , which has angered both ankara and baghdad .
turkey fears the referendum , which was overwhelmingly approved , could fuel support for separatism in its southeastern region , and has threatened economic and military measures in response .
