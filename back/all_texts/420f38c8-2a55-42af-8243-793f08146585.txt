Larry Wilmore used the n-word on Saturday night to cap off his bit at the White House Correspondents Dinner to congratulate President Obama, and that made one Fox host incredibly jealous.
Yo Barry, you did it, my n***a, Wilmore declared in celebration of President Obama s eight year tenure as the nation s first African-American Commander-in-Chief.Here s Larry Wilmore s full performance.
His remarks above are at the end of the video:President Obama didn t have a problem with it, but Fox News host Todd Starnes sure did, and he let everyone know about it by throwing a temper tantrum on Twitter.He accused Wilmore, who is black, of being racist and whined about how shameful it is to use the N-word while talking about the president.Dear @larrywilmore race baiting isn t funny and using a racial epithet is incredibly despicable.
#NerdProm #shameful toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) May 1, 2016 What @larrywilmore called the President at the end of that disgusting speech was despicable incredibly shameful.
toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) May 1, 2016Of course, President Obama is also black and the n-word has become a term of endearment used among some members of the black community in an effort to reclaim the word from its racist past.And Twitter users were quick to roast Starnes:Sorry you got so butthurt, @toddstarnes.
I m pretty sure @larrywilmore doesn t give a shit.

chauncey devega (@chaunceydevega) May 1, 2016White conservatives are complaining that Larry Wilmore uttered nigga ?
And Republicans are about to nominate a dude endorsed by the Klan.
Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) May 1, 2016 White people only mad Wilmore called Obama a nigga because they ve been screaming it in their heads for 8 yrs now and can t say it nae (@neyshajasme) May 1, 2016Indeed, conservatives have disrespected President Obama and the office he occupies for eight years now and they have desperately wanted to call him the n-word because they are racists.
In fact, they are so racist that they are literally nominating a man who has the full support of white supremacist groups to be the Republican candidate for president in the 2016 Election.Now, THAT S shameful.Featured image via screenshot
