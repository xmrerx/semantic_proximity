united nations ( reuters ) - u.n secretary-general antonio guterres appealed to iranian president hassan rouhani for the release of u.s. citizen and former u.n. official baquer namazi , a u.n. spokesman said on thursday .
the pair met on monday on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly .
the secretary-general did raise the issue and again appealed for the release of baquer namazi on humanitarian grounds , u.n. spokesman stephane dujarric said .
last october , an iranian court sentenced namazi , 80 , and his son 46-year-old siamak namazi to 10 years in prison on charges of spying and cooperating with the united states .
