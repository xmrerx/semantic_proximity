Republicans in Congress are holding up a measure to provide relief to the citizens of Flint, Michigan whose water supply has been poisoned.Instead of acting to pass a provision which would remove the compromised pipes bringing water into the homes of the city s mostly black population, Republicans in the Senate are blocking progress.Sens.
Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats of Michigan, started pushing the issue last week as the Senate began debate on the energy bill.
Their provision would provide $600 million in emergency funding to Flint to replace and fix the city s water supply infrastructure and establish a center dedicated to helping people in Flint recover from lead poisoning.
Republicans scolded Democrats for using the crisis to play politics, and argued it is a state and local problem.Ahead of the procedural vote, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) delivered scathing remarks on the floor, accusing Republicans of abandoning the people of Flint.
One hundred thousand people in Flint, Michigan, have been poisoned, and Republicans do nothing, Reid said.
Nine thousand little children all under the age of 6 have been poisoned, their brains attack by the contaminated water.
Still, Senate Republicans refuse to help.
Republicans are insisting that the money to help Flint must be offset elsewhere in the budget.
Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) blasted this tactic from Republicans on the Senate floor, noting: This is of catastrophic, almost Armageddon proportion, that an American city has been poisoned.
Let s get real.
We are now bogged down in Washington wonky budgeteer talk: Where is the offsets?
What is this?
What is this?
Are we human beings?
There was also considerable hypocrisy on the behalf of Republicans opposed to helping Flint.
