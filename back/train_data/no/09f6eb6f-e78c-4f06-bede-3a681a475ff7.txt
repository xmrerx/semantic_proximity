lima ( reuters ) - teachers in peru started returning to classrooms on monday after union leaders announced they should suspend a strike that had sparked unrest and dragged on for more than two months in some places .
teachers at public schools in peru had sought a sharper salary hike than the government s 12 percent proposal for next year and opposed evaluation-based firings .
but union leader pedro castillo announced a temporary end to the strike during the weekend after the government threatened to dismiss teachers who did not return to class .
the strike threatened to force 3.5 million school children to repeat the academic year and had sunk president pedro pablo kuczynski s approval rating as teachers blocked roads and clashed with police .
the education ministry urged parents to work with teachers to set up schedules to make up for lost time .
the government offered to introduce its proposed salary increase to a minimum of 2,000 soles ( $ 618 ) per month in november instead of next year and said teachers 55 and older could retire early .
kuczynski s approval rating dropped 13 percentage points to 19 percent in august , according to a monthly opinion poll by gfk - a new low for the former wall street banker in his year-old government .
