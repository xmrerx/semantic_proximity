House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) confirmed Wednesday that members of President Donald Trump s transition team were surveilled by the Obama administration.Nunes told reporters that the surveillance appeared to be incidental and legal.
I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition, Nunes said.
Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or not apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.
Nunes also said none of the surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities.
Nunes added that the committee would continue to investigate the matter.Nunes told House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) what he had learned, and said he would be briefing Trump on Wednesday as well.It was not confirmed whether Trump s personal communications were surveilled.
