monrovia ( reuters ) - liberia s opposition liberty party will take its claims of election fraud to the supreme court this week after the electoral commission ruled on friday that the first-round oct. 10 vote was fair , it said on sunday .
the appeal will likely set the west african country s presidential election back well into december , and could result in the first round poll being re-run , which could delay the first democratic transfer of power in over 70 years by months .
ex football star george weah was meant to face vice-president joseph boakai in a run-off vote in early november to determine who will replace nobel peace prize laureate ellen johnson sirleaf .
but third placed candidate charles brumskine of the liberty party said the oct. 10 first round was marred by widespread fraud , and the supreme court ordered the national elections commission ( nec ) to investigate .
the nec ruled last week that voting irregularities did not alter the outcome of the first round which weah won with 38 percent versus boakai with 29 percent .
brumskine won nearly 10 percent .
international observers said the vote was largely free and fair .
we will take our case to the supreme court any time this week , brumskine told reuters .
we were not surprised by the ruling .
nec were the defendants and judge at the same time .
the delay has raised tensions in liberia where many say they are dissatisfied by johnson sirleaf s 12-year rule which cemented peace and brought much needed aid to the country after a civil war but which did little to alleviate dire poverty .
the liberty party complained of widespread irregularities in the vote , including polling stations not allowing his supporters to cast their ballot .
under the constitution , it has until friday to file its appeal , after which the supreme court has a further seven days to make a final ruling .
