Donald Trump s Education Department is pathetic now that Betsy DeVos is in control, and this proves it.DeVos first week as Secretary of Education has been terrible to say the least.First, she was blocked from entering a public school by protesters and ran away.
Then she posted a tweet jokingly asking where the pencils are, which drew a sharp rebuke from teachers, who did not find her joke funny because they usually have to buy their own school supplies for their classrooms.And so, the Department of Education under DeVos rule is off to a rough start, and it got downright embarrassing on Sunday as Americans watched in horror as the Education Department proceeded to post Twitter messages containing misspelled words.Seriously.
This is the f*cking Department of Education we are talking about.
Spelling should be in their wheelhouse.
But because of Trump and DeVos, that skill has apparently been lost.In celebration of Black History Month, the Department of Education decided to recognize and quote W.E.B.
Du Bois.
It did NOT go well.Education must not simply teach work it must teach life.
W.E.B.
DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA US Dept of Education (@usedgov) February 12, 2017That s right.
DeVos and her team actually misspelled Du Bois name.
And mockery and outrage rained down upon them for it.Welp, this is a foreshadowing of what #BetsyDeVos is going to usher in @usedgov.
FFS!
It s #BlackHistoryMonth too!??W.
E. B.
Du Bois??

Ryan Wyatt (@Fwiz) February 12, 2017@usedgov I am glad my public school teachers taught me how to properly spell the names of noted scholars!!
Maris Kreizman (@mariskreizman) February 12, 2017@usedgov OMG, it s DuBois.
Who is in charge over there?
oh, wait, I get it.

@usedgov First y all thought Frederick Douglass was alive, now you can t spell Du Bois.
This bodes well for an already faltering system.
Mehreen Kasana (@mehreenkasana) February 12, 2017Hilarious, @usedgov.
It s either a terrible mistake or a perverse foray into humor.
His name is W.E.B.
Du Bois.

Was she distracted by a grizzly?

@pc7 (@pjcc777) February 12, 2017@usedgov How the hell do you misspell his name?
If this isn t foreshadowing the shitstorm of #BetsyDeVos, then I don t know what is S vion (@SavionWright) February 12, 2017I see they left Ms. DuVos in charge of the @usedgov Twitter feed pic.twitter.com/SW0scGm49u Jason Tocci (@JasonT) February 12, 2017Protesters should ve let @BetsyDeVos into the school long enough to learn how to spell his name correctly @usedgovhttps://t.co/PDzsGU5Xev Carlton Banksy (@rtyson82) February 12, 2017And if that wasn t enough, the Department of Education posted a corrected version and then posted an apology tweet that was also misspelled.Again, seriously.
Education must not simply teach work it must teach life.

The Dept.
of Education misspelled DuBois #bydhttmwfi https://t.co/PT6I1Em8aN LeVar Burton (@levarburton) February 12, 2017Betsy DeVos hasn t even been in charge for a full week and she has already repeatedly proved that while money can buy a Cabinet seat, in her case it could not buy a decent education.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
