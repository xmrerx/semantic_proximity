beirut ( reuters ) - elections organized by the kurdish-led authorities of northern syria will be held on dec. 1 , part of a process leading to the creation of a local parliament by early 2018 , a spokesman said on saturday .
ibrahim ibrahim , a spokesman for the syrian kurdish party , said the elections would be for local town and city councils , with more than 30 parties and entities participating .
northern syrians held the first phase of elections in september , where voters picked leaders for some 3,700 communes spread across three regions of the north where kurdish groups have established autonomous rule since 2011 , when syria s civil war erupted .
elections will culminate in january with the election of an assembly that will act as a parliament for a federal system of government in northern syria .
the election points to the ambitions of kurdish groups and their allies that control close to a quarter of syria , whose stated aim is to secure autonomy as part of a decentralized syria .
the groups insist they do not want to follow the example of the kurds of northern iraq , whose vote on an independence referendum in september prompted western opposition and fierce resistance from baghdad , ankara and tehran .
syria s main kurdish groups hope for a new phase of negotiations that will shore up their autonomy in northern syria .
syrian president bashar al-assad s government , however , is asserting its claim to areas captured by the syrian defense forces ( sdf ) from the islamic state in more forceful terms .
earlier this month , a top adviser to assad said what happened in iraqi kurdistan should be a lesson to the sdf , adding that she does not think any government can discuss with any group when it comes to the topic of the country s unity .
