With the passing of the legendary music icon Prince, many have been going to their music libraries to binge listen to everything they own that was done by the musician.
It s a way for people to both grieve and celebrate the life of such an immense talent that was a gift to everyone he came in contact with, whether personally, or through his music.Yet, digging through the very large amount of music that Prince was a part of, it turns out that in the 90s Prince wrote a song called Donald Trump (Black Version) put out by the group The Time.
Upon listening to the lyrics, it seems it s a song that has a man trying to be everything to a woman by buying her affection.Here s a brief taste of the lyrics: Honey baby, you truly know it.
You truly know it.
You look good.
Tryin your best to show it.
If I were you, I would.
True love and affection.
These are nice, so nice but when a money man walks in the room, girl, you look more than twice.
You look once, you look twice.
Can I rap to you sugar tonight?
(chorus) Donald Trump (black version), maybe that s what you need.
A man that fulfills your every wish, your every dream.
Donald Trump (black version), come on take a chance.
A 1990 s love affair, the real romance.
Flash forward to 2016, and the real Donald Trump is trying to buy the nation s affection to win himself the White House, even though he has no diplomatic, policy, or political experience whatsoever.Hopefully, money can only buy the Donald Trump s of the world love and not the presidency.Listen to the entire song here:Featured Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images
