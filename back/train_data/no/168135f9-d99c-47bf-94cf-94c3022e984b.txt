make america work again !
white house counselor kellyanne conway says people on medicaid who will lose coverage under the republican plan to repeal obamacare could find jobs that provide health insurance.when the affordable care act expanded medicaid coverage , conway said , that opened it up to healthy people who could theoretically work , conway told abc s this week on sunday .
obamacare took medicaid , which was designed to help the poor , the needy , the sick , disabled , also children and pregnant women , it took it and went way above the poverty line to many able-bodied americans , she said .
they should probably find other at least see if there are other options for them .
conway went on : if they are able-bodied and they want to work , then they ll have employer-sponsored benefits like you and i do .
