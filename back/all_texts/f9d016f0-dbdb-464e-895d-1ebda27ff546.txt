BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels prosecutors will hold a news conference at 1300 GMT on sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, the subject of a European arrest warrant issued by Spain, a spokesman for the Belgian authority said on Sunday.
Warrants for rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to Catalonia s independence campaign concern Puigdemont and four of his associates who fled to Belgium after Madrid s central government imposed direct rule in the autonomous region.
We will give a press conference at 2 p.m. (local time).
I can t confirm the arrests of the five people, spokesman Gilles Dejemeppe said.
According to Belgian procedures, prosecutors must bring suspects to a judge, who has 24 hours to decide whether or not to approve the arrest warrant.
Appeals can stretch the process to as long as 45 days.
