we are blessed to be joined tonight by carryn owens , the widow of a u.s. navy special operator , senior chief william ryan owens .
ryan died as he lived : a warrior , and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation .
i just spoke to general mattis , who reconfirmed that , and i quote , ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies .
ryan s legacy is etched into eternity .
for as the bible teaches us , there is no greater act of love than to lay down one s life for one s friends .
ryan laid down his life for his friends , for his country and for our freedom we will never forget him .
