TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday that currency policy was not an issue that should be discussed between leaders of countries as doing so would make it a political issue.
Abe made the remark in parliament when asked by a lawmaker if he would discuss currencies in a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump next week.
“I’ll explain (our policy) if asked,” Abe said.
