alexandria , egypt ( reuters ) - a court in alexandria has ordered the detention of leading rights activist mahienour el-massry over charges of illegally protesting in june against the egyptian government s decision to transfer two red sea islands to saudi arabia .
el-massry was detained in egypt s second largest city along with activist moatasim medhat and both will be held pending their trial for illegal assembly on dec. 30 , the misdemeanour court said .
the pair s lawyer , taher abo nasser , said they denied the charges , adding that there was no evidence of a protest taking place .
the decision came as a shock for us but mahienour is remaining strong and accepting , abo nasser said .
the plan to cede the islands to saudi arabia was announced last year and has become mired in political protest and legal action .
opponents of the plan say egypt s sovereignty over the islands dates back to 1906 , before saudi arabia was founded .
saudi and egyptian officials say the islands belong to the kingdom and were only under egyptian control because riyadh had asked cairo in 1950 to protect them .
