WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he was not ready to support the policy agenda being advanced by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the nation’s top elected Republican, who said earlier he was not ready to endorse Trump.
“I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan’s agenda,” Trump said in a statement.
“Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people.”
