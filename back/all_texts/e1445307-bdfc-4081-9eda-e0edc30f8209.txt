Laura Loomer decided to make a trip to Brookfield, CT to see how customers at Costco were receiving Crooked Hillary at her book signing tour.
Loomer is the same awesome activist who bravely stormed the stage in Central Park and disrupted the Trump assassination play (click HERE for the video), this summer.
Last week, Loomer was forcibly removed from Hillary s book signing in New York.
When it was her turn to have her book signed, Loomer asked Hillary questions like, Where are your 33,000 emails?
and What happened to Seth Rich?
(Click HERE for Hillary ambush video).
Hillary s reaction was priceless.Here is Laura s video showing the reaction by customers to Hillary appearing at their local Costco for a book signing: Protesters at Hillary Clinton book signing in Brookfield, CT https://t.co/QYNtcVGlKJ Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 16, 2017Loomer was eventually blocked by secret service from getting too close to Hillary.
Hillary clearly didn t want any more nasty videos out there exposing the truth about the questions Americans really want to hear her answer:Just showed up to @Costco for @HillaryClinton book signing and when I arrived police said @SecretService told them not to let me in.
Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 16, 2017That moment when @HillaryClinton blocks Laura from going to Costco with secret service and she wanted to be president??
Haha.
Way to go loom https://t.co/kmModmdsJ8 Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) September 16, 2017Costco did allow Loomer inside the store, in spite of Hillary s request to keep her away:Thank you @Costco for respecting my first amendment right and allowing me inside despite @HillaryClinton telling @SecretService to ban me!
Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 16, 2017Loomer was told by Costco employees that they don t understand why Costco would allow her to come and that customers were canceling their memberships:A @Costco employee just told me "IDK why they even let her come.
They said a lot of people have canceled their memberships.
We hate her."

Yes, #WhatHappened is in the toilet paper aisle @Costco!

She's a criminal!"
Westchester.
