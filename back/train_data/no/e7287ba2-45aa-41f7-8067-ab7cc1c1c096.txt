amsterdam ( reuters ) - bosnian croat war crimes convict slobodan praljak used cyanide to kill himself in court after losing his appeal , according to preliminary autopsy findings , dutch prosecutors said on friday .
praljak , 72 , announced that he had taken poison immediately after his conviction and 20-year sentence were upheld by appeals judges at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on wednesday , and died shortly afterward .
in a statement , prosecutors said a toxicological test had found that praljak had a concentration of potassium cyanide in his blood .
this resulted in a failure of the heart , which is indicated as the suspected cause of death , they added .
earlier on friday , the tribunal said it had launched its own independent review into the death .
praljak committed suicide in the final minutes of the last verdict at the court before it closes later this month .
i just drank poison , the ex-general told the stunned court in a hearing that was being broadcast online .
i am not a war criminal .
i oppose this conviction .
prosecutors said they were focusing their investigation on how praljak had managed to obtain a banned substance in the high-security u.n. building .
