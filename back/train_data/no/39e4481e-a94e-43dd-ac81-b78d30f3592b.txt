beirut ( reuters ) - saad al-hariri returned to beirut on tuesday for the first time since he resigned as lebanon s prime minister in a broadcast from saudi arabia and plunged his country into political crisis .
hariri s sudden resignation on nov. 4 thrust lebanon to the forefront of regional tussle between the sunni monarchy of saudi arabia and shi ite islamist iran , whose powerful lebanese ally hezbollah is part of the government .
hariri was greeted by members of the security forces as he disembarked from a jet at beirut airport , live footage of his arrival showed .
hariri , a long-time ally of saudi arabia , cited fear of assassination and meddling by iran and hezbollah in the arab world in his resignation speech .
the move caught even his aides off guard , and politicians close to him say riyadh forced him to quit and held him in saudi arabia .
riyadh and hariri have denied this .
lebanese president michel aoun has refused to accept the resignation until hariri returns to present it in person .
earlier , hariri met egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi in cairo , saying after the meeting that he would announce his political position in lebanon .
in a nov. 12 interview from saudi arabia with future tv , a station affiliated with his political party , hariri said he would return to lebanon to confirm his resignation .
but he also held out the possibility of withdrawing it if hezbollah respected lebanon s policy of staying out of regional conflicts such as yemen .
