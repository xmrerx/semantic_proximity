If average voters turned on the TV for five minutes this week, chances are they know that Donald Trump made lewd remarks a decade ago and now stands accused of groping women.But even if average voters had the TV on 24/7, they still probably haven t heard the news about Hillary Clinton: That the nation now has proof of pretty much everything she has been accused of.It comes from hacked emails dumped by WikiLeaks, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, and accounts from FBI insiders.
The media has almost uniformly ignored the flurry of bombshells, preferring to devote its front pages to the Trump story.
So let s review what amounts to a devastating case against a Clinton presidency.Start with a June 2015 email to Clinton staffers from Erika Rottenberg, the former general counsel of LinkedIn.

She added: It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.
