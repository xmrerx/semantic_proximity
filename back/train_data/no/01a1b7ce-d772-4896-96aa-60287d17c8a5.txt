trump is not keeping his promises .
as far as his supporters were concerned , he started off okay , but over the last few weeks he s done a stunning array of flip-flops , and people apparently are not happy about it .
in february , gallup conducted a poll of people who believed trump would keep his promises , and at that time , a majority of american ( 62 percent ) believed he would .
now that has flip-flopped , and today , only 45 percent believe he ll keep his promises.so what all has he flipped on ? and there s probably a lot more .
in short , he s proven that he s not the open , honest , and trustworthy man he claimed to be on the campaign trail , and people are finally starting to wake up to that .
too little , too late , though , since he s already in office.but wait !
there s more .
only 52 percent of americans believe trump is a strong and decisive leader , down from 59 percent in february .
46 percent believe he can bring about the changes we need here , down from 53 percent .
36 percent see him as honest and trustworthy , down from 42 percent .
42 percent believe he cares about their needs , down from 46 percent , and 41 percent believe he can effectively manage the government , down from 44 percent.in other words , fewer people trust trump to pretty much do anything now than they did a mere two months ago .
as trump approaches his first 100-day mark , that s a humiliating picture.featured image by ron sachs-pool via getty images
