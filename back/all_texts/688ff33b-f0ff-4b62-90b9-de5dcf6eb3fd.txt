SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean fishing boat capsized off the country s western coast on Sunday after it collided with a refueling vessel, killing eight people, South Korea s coast guard said.
The boat was carrying two sailors and 20 passengers when the collision occurred in waters near Incheon west of Seoul, a coast guard official told a media briefing.
Two people remain missing and a search and rescue operation involving five helicopters and 19 vessels is underway.
