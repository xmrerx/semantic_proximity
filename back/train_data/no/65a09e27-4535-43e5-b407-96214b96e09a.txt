remember this ?
if they bring a knife to the fight , we bring a gun .
yep , that was obama speaking to an audience in philadelphia oh wait , we ve got more i want you to argue with them , get in their face yet obama had this to say about trump : in fact it s been interesting when you look at what s happening with mr. trump when he has made some of the remarks that , for example , challenge the heroism of mr. mccain , someone who endured torture and conducted himself with exemplary patriotism .
uh .
the republican party is shocked and yet that arises out of a culture where those kind of outrageous attacks have become far too commonplace and get circulated nonstop through the internet , and talk radio and news outlets .
and , i recognize that when outrageous statements are made about me , a lot of the same people who were outraged when they were made about mr. mccain were pretty quiet .
