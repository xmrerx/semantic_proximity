Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is over the moon with happiness after Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence refused to call him deplorable.
In a CNN interview on Monday afternoon, Pence told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer that he doesn t name call, and would not call avowed racist and anti-Semite David Duke deplorable, as Hillary Clinton has repeatedly done during the campaign.
Later asked to do so in a Fox News interview, Pence again refused.This has made Duke, currently running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, very happy.
It s good to see an individual like Pence and others start to reject this absolute controlled media, Duke told BuzzFeed News.
The truth is that the Republican Party in Louisiana I received the vast majority of Republican votes for United States senator before and for governor before that in my state.
The truth is the Republican Party is big tent.
I served in the Republican caucus.
I was in the Republican caucus in the legislature.
I had a perfect Republican voting record.
It s ridiculous that they attack me because of my involvement in that nonviolent Klan four decades ago.
Duke is a former Grand Wizard, part of the leadership of the Ku Klux Klan, a hate group with a very long history of terrorizing black families all across the country.
The Klan was very involved in the lynching deaths of blacks, other killings, and initiated the practice of burning crosses on the property of blacks in order to frighten them.In addition, Duke is also an anti-Semite who has promoted the concept of Holocaust denial and the conspiracy theorists who promote the fake history surrounding that idea.Duke has endorsed the Trump/Pence presidential ticket, and while Trump now says he rejects the move, Trump also refused on three occasions in one CNN interview to condemn Duke and his support.Featured image via YouTube
