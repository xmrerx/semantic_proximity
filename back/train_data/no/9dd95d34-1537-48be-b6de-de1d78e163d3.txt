we liberals have known exactly who donald trump really is all along .
we knew which campaign promises he intended to keep and which were just a steaming pile of bullsh * t aimed at wooing his poorly educated supporters .
and since election day , we have been eagerly awaiting the mournful cries of those that swallowed his lies hook , line and sinker when they finally realize who he truly is and how he s going to screw over the american people.the twitter page trump regrets has compiled the tweets of sorrowful trump supporters who have caught on that they ve been had by a con-man .
the page was created in november 2016 and has already amassed 105,000 followers .
and yes , it is everything you hoped it would be.some people are sick of his obsession with the media and the horrible grammar found in his numerous twitter rants .
other people are shocked that he did exactly what he said he was going to do by enacting his muslim ban , building his stupid wall , pushing the dakota access pipeline through and doing away with obamacare.damn @ realdonaldtrump keeps getting worse every day .
can i take my vote back ?

p d off amer.patriot ( @ drgnslr441 ) january 25 , 2017the list of tweets compiled by trump regrets goes on and on .
and there is no doubt that the number of trump voters who realize they were duped by this orange tinged madman will certainly continue to grow .
but you have to wonder , how did they not see this coming ?
trump is doing the very things he said he would do all along .
yet , somehow these morons just didn t manage to catch on and now they re in a state of shock .
the absurdity of it all boggles the mind.featured image via shawn thew-pool/getty images
