On Monday night s Daily Show, host Trevor Noah wrestled with the problem facing Americans in any election cycle: we want both a president and a drinking buddy.
Someone who can get the job done, but someone to whom we can relate.
But it s ok now, because Noah solved it.Noah s sensible and hilarious conclusion is that America must elect both a president and a mascot.
Think how much time and embarrassment candidates would save if they didn t have to run around pretending to be normal people?
Noah runs through the shambles of Hillary Clinton s subway ride, Bernie Sanders singing along to Hamilton, and John Kasich stuffing his face like an idiot (a focus group must have discovered gluttony is now an attractive trait in a candidate).
Voters need a brilliant policy mind..but at the same time, Americans want a leader who s just a fun best friend.And I get that.
But maybe, we shouldn t demand that these two be the same person?
Isn t it a stroke of genius?
Someone with capability, intellect and knowledge who can devise and execute smart and effective policy.
And someone to wave their arms about, shouts encouraging cheers, kisses babies and generally just pump everybody the hell up.But where, Noah wonders, would we find a brightly colored cartoon character with a giant head and weird-sized hands ?Then he lands on it.
We already found him.
He s the current GOP frontrunner.While Donald Trump may not be fit to be American President, he would make a damn fine American Mascot.Even better, we would never have to watch Hillary Clinton attempt to Whip or Nae Nae ever again.
There is literally no downside to this plan.
So come Election 2016: Vote Trump, for American Mascot.
Do your part to Make America Great Again.
