Penn Jillette doesn t want Donald Trump to run for president, and apparently, neither does Bloomberg News.
They asked Penn to create a new card trick representing Trump s campaign, and it apparently only took him a few seconds to do so, because that s how much of a disaster Trump s campaign is.He starts with a deck of cards and it seems like an ordinary, pick a card, stick it back in the deck and I ll find it card trick.
He then explains how all the shuffling cards while talking around is misdirection, and uses that as an analogy for many of Trump s outlandish statements.The video even shows Trump making some of his idiotic statements and lies, like his repeated attacks on the Khan family, his misogynistic blood coming out of her wherever slam of Megyn Kelly, and his claim that he wouldn t lose support even if he shot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue.But it s the trick itself, and the ending that are the real gems of the video.
Watch below:Trump s campaign isn t a train wreck waiting to happen, it s a flat-out train wreck, especially given the week he s had.
Come November, his campaign will end the same way this card trick does.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
