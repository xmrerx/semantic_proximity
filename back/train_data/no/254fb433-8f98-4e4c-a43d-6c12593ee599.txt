luxembourg ( reuters ) - european commission president jean claude juncker said on friday he did not want catalonia to become independent , because that would encourage other regions to do the same , making the european union ungovernable .
if we allow catalonia and it is not our business to separate , others will do the same .
i do not want that , jean claude juncker said in a speech at luxembourg university .
i wouldn t like a european union in 15 years that consists of some 98 states , he continued .
it s already relatively difficult with 28 and with 27 not easier , but with 98 it would simply be impossible .
the eu s statistics agency eurostat lists the bloc as consisting of 98 major regions .
juncker said he was very worried about separatist tendencies in europe and had encouraged spanish prime minister mariano rajoy to ensure the situation did not get out of control .
referring to catalan calls for eu mediation , he said the commission could not mediate if only one side asked it to do so .
the eu has said it has confidence in rajoy to resolve what it sees as an internal issue .
if the commission or european council president ( donald ) tusk were to get involved with only one party asking for mediation , this would lead to a great rejection of the european union , juncker said .
