Hillary Clinton may be favored in the polls to take the Democratic nomination and she may be considered the most likely candidate to be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States and even SHE doesn t want to see the Republicans succeed in obstructing President Obama s constitutional duty to nominate the next associate justice of the Supreme Court.In fact, she got so tired so quickly of all the talk, she decided to tweet an all-out assault on Republican stupidity with an eleven-point argument about why they re idiots, beginning with the obvious:1 Until Jan. 20, 2017, it's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices it's right there in the Constitution.

The president gets to nominate people regardless of what Mitch McConnell says.
Surely Hillary Clinton would love the honor of nominating the next justice herself given the opportunity, but she understands that there is too much at stake.
Her epic tweetfest continues:3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration.
-H Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016It s not as if the right cares one iota about the fate of immigrants, but the rest of us certainly do.
The president s actions are the only positive thing to come out of government on immigration since the snoozefest of Republican control began.5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some.
-H Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Should the rights of American voters and the decisions of American women be left to a 4-4 tie, these cases could very well revert down to the decisions of lower courts and in these cases, the conservative judges who have allowed such egregious violations of the constitution to move forward.6 These decisions could determine whether we as a nation uphold our principles of liberty and equality, or turn back the clock.
-H Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Well said.
Turning back the clock has been the Republican agenda for years, so nothing new there, but the ability to stave off the stupidity with a ruling by the highest court in the land is essential.8 I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn t righteous, it's disgraceful.
-H Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016And the truth shall set you free.
Republicans have been enjoying long vacations of obstruction for far too long.
Even with control of congress, they accomplish nothing but witch-hunt hearings and idiotic legislation they know has no chance of being signed by the president.10 As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0.
-H Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Some simple facts that Republicans will ignore.
And finally, in closing:11 So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy.
@POTUS will do his job.
Do yours.
-H Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016On behalf of the sane people of America Thank you, Secretary Clinton.Featured image from Twitter
