debbie dooley and a crowd of great patriots marched in front of the cnn headquarters in atlanta today in a show of support for president trump and in protest against cnn s fake news .
who isn t proud of these people literally walking the walk to voice their opposition to the constant drip , drip , drip of propaganda from cnn.debbie dooley of main street patriots told breitbart news why they were protesting cnn today : cnn threw objective journalism out the window once donald trump was elected president and have begun to report dnc talking points as news .
cnn can no longer claim to be a news organization that reports facts without bias , because they report innuendo with no facts as news with the intent on bringing down a democratically-elected president .
they have simply become an entertainment network not to be taken seriously.time for trump supporters to get active and show the democrats that we are very passionate about our support of president trump and we will fight hard to pass his agenda , the notice of the event states on main street patriots website .
bring your signs and let s show cnn that we support president trump and call them out for becoming an arm of the dnc intent on bringing down president trump with biased coverage and false innuendos , the invitation on main street patriots facebook page states.a trump supporter on why she s joining the protest : she is 100 % spot on trump supporter on why she 's joining protest against fake news cnn .
she is 100 % spot on .
