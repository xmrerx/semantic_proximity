OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian police said on Wednesday they had lowered the national threat assessment, but still regarded an attack by militants as a possibility.
The risk level was lowered to possible from likely , reversing an April decision to raise the threat assessment following an Oslo bomb scare and an attack in neighboring Sweden, where four people were killed.
