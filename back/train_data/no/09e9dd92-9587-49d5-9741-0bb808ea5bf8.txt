what in the world is wrong with these press people at the state department !
is the guy asking the question really serious when he asks the most idiotic question about the timing of the announcements over the release and then death of otto warmbier .
we wish we knew the name of the jackhole reporter who asked the question !
listen to this condescending jerk : the state department did release a statement when warmbier was released and when he passed away .
so the question is just the nasty press being nasty.upon his release press statement : press statement rex w. tillerson secretary of state washington , dc june 13 , 2017at the direction of the president , the department of state has secured the release of otto warmbier from north korea .
mr. warmbier is en route to the united states , where he will be reunited with his family .
the department of state continues to have discussions with the dprk regarding three other u.s. citizens reported detained.out of respect for the privacy of mr. warmbier and his family , we have no further comment on mr. warmbier.upon his passing press statement : press statement rex w. tillerson secretary of state washington , dc june 19 , 2017today we received with deep sadness the news that otto warmbier has passed away.on behalf of the entire state department and the united states government , i extend my condolences to the warmbier family , and offer my prayers as they enter a time of grief no parent should ever know.we hold north korea accountable for otto warmbier s unjust imprisonment , and demand the release of three other americans who have been illegally detained.wouldn y a better question have been why obama did nothing to help with the release of warmbier ?
