a liberal from massachusetts recently attended a trump rally in the city of lowell and decided to give us all an inside look into the circus that is the donald show by live tweeting the entire time he was there and it was brilliant.daniel danger wrote an article about his january 4 , trump experience on storify , adding commentary about the rally in his tweets .
he started out by explaining that he is a left-leaning , small business owner who pays a lot of taxes , paid his college loans off , and is pretty ok with guns .
he is literally the kind of guy that the republican party is always blithering on about and saying they support ( well , except the whole liberal thing ) .while at the rally , danger started out his tweet-fest by describing some of the people he d encountered:9/11 truthers spotted .

and then there was this guy .man wearing a trump plastic bag pic.twitter.com/nrsd7cpkzu daniel danger ( @ tinymediaempire ) january 4 , 2016as someone who has been to a trump event ( i stayed outside even though i had tickets because i hate stupid people ) , i can tell you that his descriptions of the fans are spot on .
i can not tell you how ashamed i was of our country when i saw them first hand .
it was the first time i d ever been surrounded by so many ignorant people .
for instance , this guy was at the event i went to : image via facebookdanger then took a photo of the arena that trump bragged about filling to capacity .
the venue was about half full and he explained later in the evening that seats did fill out , but there were tons of empty spots.make no mistake , this place is less than half full .
pic.twitter.com/oskdatutkg daniel danger ( @ tinymediaempire ) january 4 , 2016when trump started speaking , the writer explained that he constantly flipped back and forth between topics .
he said the candidate did it so often that he couldn t follow him : he is literally changing subjects every two sentences , its impossible to follow .
