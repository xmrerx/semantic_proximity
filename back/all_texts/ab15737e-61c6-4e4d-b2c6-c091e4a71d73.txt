Racism is still very prevalent in America.
And not just in the way we usually talk about it, either.
Perhaps one of the most pervasive forms of racism is in everyday beauty standards, and it was on full display in the comments section of an Instagram post by MAC Cosmetics.
The company was promoting a new shade of lipstick, and they used a black model with dark skin and very full lips to promote the lipstick.
Here is an embed of that post:Royal romance at @ohnetitelny #AW16.

Well, not to the racists in the comments section.
Not long after the post went up, the racist trolls were out in force, mocking the model s lips.
Here are just a few of the worst comments, before whoever runs MAC s Instagram account started removing the negativity, courtesy of Attn.com:And, as I said before, those are just a few.
The post went viral, with thousands of horrible comments, and Mic News Editor Ashley Alese Edwards screen capped and tweeted some of the more offensive ones:What happens when MAC posts a photo of a beautiful black woman's NATURAL lips on Instagram pic.twitter.com/4bGoT7xiN9 Ashley Alese Edwards (@AshleyAlese) February 18, 2016The funny thing is, plenty of white women get injections and all sorts of treatments to make their lips look like gasp!
a black woman s natural lips.
It s only ugly and repulsive to society when it s displayed on black women.
That is what is so sickening about all of this it s just sheer, unabashed hatred based upon race.Hopefully, one day, they see the irony behind what they are doing here.
Somehow, I doubt it, though.Featured image from screen capture via MAC Cosmetics Instagram
