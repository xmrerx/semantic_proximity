pic.twitter.com/kaiwqppz1t gay & deplorable ( @ purplemeatballs ) august 22 , 2017leading anti-trump activists backed by major democratic donors including george soros are mobilizing large numbers of protesters ahead of president trump s rally in phoenix on tuesday , with the intention of stealing the spotlight from the president s event.local leaders of indivisible , one of many resistance protest groups formed as a direct response to trump s election , are organizing thousands of protesters associated with a coalition of left-wing groups ahead of tuesday s event .
in addition to organizing mass protests outside the rally , indivisible is encouraging protesters to register for tickets for the rally itself , increasing the likelihood that protesters will disrupt trump s speech , as often happens at trump s rallies.although originally founded by activists not backed by donors , indivisible s website now states that the group is a project of the advocacy fund , a progressive advocacy group that receives money from the open society policy center , an arm of soros open society foundations .
that revelation follows usa today s reporting in may that leaders of indivisible and women s march met with democracy alliance , a soros-led network of left-wing donors , to discuss funding options.via : daily callervia : truthfeed
