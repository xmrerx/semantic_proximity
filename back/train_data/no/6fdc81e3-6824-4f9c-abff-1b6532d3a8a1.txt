cnn has once again set the stage for a democratic politician to attempt a smackdown of president trump .
in this case , rep. keith ellison ( d-mn ) felt the need to parrot what his brothers and sisters in arms have been trying to shove down america s throat ; that we need to impeach the president.during the democratic national committee leadership debate that aired on cnn , ellison was asked if he agreed with his fellow democratic party members rep. maxine waters ( d-ca ) and rep. joaquin castro ( d-tx ) who have said congress should draw up articles of impeachment against president trump.ellison : i think donald trump has already done a number of things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment .
( applause ) i mean on day one , he was in violation of emoluments clause of the constitution .
ellison is the first muslim member of congress and a longtime defender of nation of islam leader louis farrakhan .
the fact that he is being considered to be a leader in the democratic national committee should tell the american people just how out of touch and dangerous , if not downright ignorant , the entire party has become.not only are they putting in positions of power men and women who subscribe to a system of belief that requires it s devotees to commit atrocities against people of other religions , it is also letting the fantasy that just because a candidate that they disagree with won the election , they should be able to have him forcibly removed from office.there are a plethora of minor of even middling issues that republicans and democrats disagree with one another on , but this problem of we don t like the president so we want to get rid of him flies in the very face of democracy.many republicans don t agree with democratic policies , but you don t see us attempting to remove every legitimately elected government official who gets in the way of our agenda .
