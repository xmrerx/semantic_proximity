belfast ( reuters ) - northern ireland s main political parties are to continue talks aimed at restoring the british region s devolved government on wednesday , a british government official said , in an apparent extension of a deadline for a deal .
representatives of irish nationalists sinn fein and the pro-british democratic unionist party ( dup ) ended their second day of talks aimed at re-establishing a power-sharing government that collapsed in january , the official said .
the british government has indicated that if the parties fail to reach agreement in the coming days it will be forced to impose a budget directly for the first time in a decade to ensure essential services are funded .
a budget set by the british government would be a major step towards direct rule from london , which could destabilize a delicate political balance there .
on monday the british government s minister for northern ireland , james brokenshire , said if there was no progress by the end of talks on tuesday he would assess whether london needed to move impose a budget .
the spokesman declined to comment when asked when that decision would be made .
the dup and sinn fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence in the province .
sinn fein pulled out in january , complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner .
