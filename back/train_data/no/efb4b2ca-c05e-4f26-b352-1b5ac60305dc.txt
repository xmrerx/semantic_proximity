washington ( reuters ) - u.s. senate democrats defeated a republican effort to undercut the iran nuclear agreement on wednesday by blocking an amendment to a spending bill that would have stopped the obama administration from buying heavy water from tehran .
the amendment to an energy spending bill offered by republican senator tom cotton received 57 yes votes and 42 no votes .
it had needed 60 yes votes to advance in the 100-member senate .
cotton withdrew his amendment after the vote and the senate is expected to vote later on a version of the spending bill without it .
the measure would have barred the use of u.s. government funds to purchase heavy water , which is non-radioactive and used in nuclear reactors and for making nuclear weapons .
under last year ’ s nuclear deal between iran , the united states and five other world powers , tehran is responsible for reducing its stock of the substance , which it can sell , dilute or dispose of , under certain conditions .
president barack obama ’ s administration had warned congress that it strongly opposed any move to prevent the planned purchase of $ 8.6 million-worth of heavy water from iran .
senate democrats and a handful of republicans had also banded together in late april to block the cotton amendment , and hence the spending bill .
the dust-up had put a crimp in senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ’ s plans to pass bipartisan appropriations bills to keep the federal government functioning beyond sept. 30 , the end of the government ’ s fiscal year .
