No matter which candidate you are supporting, this is awesome!
CNN tried to get a gotcha moment with an interview between Carol Costello and Donald Trump s former butler: He s an incredibly generous person.
He s been generous to his employees.
He s generous to strangers.
He s an entirely a nice guy.
He s not the gruff person that people make him out to be.
Sure, you attack him, he s going to fight back.
But most of the time he s just a nice man.
I lasted with him for 20 years, he had to be pretty good.
