don t mess with texas a texas pig farmer found out that muslims trying to build a mosque had purchased the land next to his farm.what s more the new muslim landowner actually asked him to leave.that s because craig baker owns a pig farm , and the muslim community hates pigs it s in the koran .
so in an effort to cleanse the land , the muslim landowner asked baker to move out.baker instead decided to fight back.baker started holding pig races every friday at the same time muslims are supposed to be saying their afternoon prayer.now local muslims ( and their liberal stooges ) are calling him a racist .
( since when is islam a race ?
) what do you think ?
did he go too far ?
should he have embraced diversity instead ?
