Donald Trump and the people in his administration have precious little to brag about nowadays, but you can t manage to convince them of this fact.
The proof is in the pudding, so they say or in this case, in the tweets.Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who Trump decided to promote to United Nations ambassador, took to Twitter on Wednesday to boast about something that is downright shameful: stripping half a billion dollars from the U.N. s peacekeeping budget.
Just 5 months into our time here, we ve cut over half a billion $$$ from the UN peacekeeping budget & we re only getting started.

Only liberal snowflakes care about preventing genocides and atrocities and human rights violations.
