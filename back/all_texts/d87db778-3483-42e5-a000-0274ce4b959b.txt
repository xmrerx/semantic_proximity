While the media is still talking about the fact that Donald Trump refuses to release his tax returns, his campaign has revealed that his vice presidential pick will be much better vetted than the man wanting the top of the ticket.
His VP candidates will have to show their tax returns.Here s the video:Trump defenders will make the point that showing tax returns is not a legal requirement to run for president, but most do and there are good reasons for it, especially with a candidate like Trump.Trump s entire campaign, and his following, has been built upon the idea that he s a magician with money.
He s such a money maven he can force unwilling governments to build a wall against their own people.
Trump talks a lot, but without seeing his tax returns, we have no idea how much money he has and how he is spending that money.
This, while he s demanding complete transparency from Hillary Clinton, and now, from his VP candidates.The MSNBC report went on to say that Trump doesn t particularly care about his VP pick s views on any given issue that there won t be a litmus test on abortion, LGBT rights or any of the other hot-button issues, but based on all around views.It is pretty normal that Trump would require the tax returns of any candidate, but face it, the odds of his Vice President having the nuclear codes or the keys to the treasury are pretty slim.
It s Trump that people are being asked to support, not some, as of now, vague idea of a VP candidate.
This is a bit like the twice divorced candidate demanding that his VP pick be married to his or her (probably his) first spouse.
It s like Trump demanding that they have a great haircut or like him demanding decorum from his picks.
Trump is asking his VP picks to jump through more hoops than he will.
This is just more proof that Trump is running for dictator, not president.Featured image via Andrew Burton at Getty Images
