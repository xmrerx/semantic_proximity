istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish authorities on monday issued arrest warrants for 107 teachers for suspected ties to the u.s.-based cleric ankara blames for orchestrating last year s coup , the dogan news agency said .
fifty-one of the teachers were detained in ankara after the local prosecutor issued the warrants , dogan said , adding that operations continued to round-up the remaining teachers .
the teachers were previously suspended from their jobs as part of the ongoing crackdown that followed the attempted coup in july 2016 , it said .
turkey blames fethullah gulen , a cleric who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , for last year s failed coup .
gulen has denied any involvement and denounced the coup .
more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial in the crackdown , while 150,000 people , including military personnel , teachers and public servants , have been sacked or suspended from their jobs .
the government dismisses rights groups concerns about the crackdown , saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says infiltrated the judiciary , army , schools and other institutions .
