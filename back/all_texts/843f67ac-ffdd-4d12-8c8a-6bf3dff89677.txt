BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday her conservatives would sound out coalition possibilities with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens as well as with the so far reluctant center-left Social Democrats (SPD).
I think all parties ... have a responsibility to ensure that there will be a stable government, Merkel told reporters after her conservative CDU/CSU bloc won Sunday s election albeit with its weakest result since 1949.
Merkel added that sustainable budget policies and domestic security would be priorities for her conservatives in the upcoming coalition talks.
