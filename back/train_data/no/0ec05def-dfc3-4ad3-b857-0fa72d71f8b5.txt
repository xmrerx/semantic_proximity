he expresses his frustration with obama and the fact that nothing in the country is any better in the minority communities as democrats claim .
when president barack obama said he d find it a personal insult if the people , black people in particular , don t vote for hillary clinton .
i find it a personal insult that you ve only made one attempt to reach out to these people .
