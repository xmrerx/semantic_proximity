Put this one under Shit You Just Can t Make Up :A U.S. Air Force base in Georgia was forced to pull a flyer advertising a Martin Luther King Jr. Day fun shoot after public outcry, reports WMAZ.The flyer featuring the face of the civil rights icon promoted a noon gathering on Jan. 18 for the Robins Air Force Base Trap and Skeet Club, where participants would get two rounds of shooting and lunch for $20.
Air Force officials pulled this provocative MLK Day Fun Shoot flyer: https://t.co/F65HoNYfwu #gapol pic.twitter.com/trss95PIcJ Greg Bluestein (@bluestein) January 14, 2016 Officials at the base insist that the whole thing was just an honest mistake and, aw shucks, they didn t mean nothin by it!
They were just some good ol boys never meanin no harm.
The official apology cleared the whole thing up: We realized the inappropriateness of the advertisement several days ago and immediately began removing the flyer.
There was no malice of forethought in the flyer s creation and it was never the base s intention to portray Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in a negative light, It continued.
It was an honest mistake, to which we ve personally counseled the parties involved and will provide them with remedial training and appropriate oversight to prevent this sort of inattention from occurring in the future.
If it was a state less prone to overwhelming racism, the apology might be believable.
But this was Georgia.
And it was the Air Force, the branch of the military most heavily infested with Christian extremism.
If you weren t aware of it, the Christian Right has been trying to turn the United States military into a religious institution for decades.
They ve had the most success in the Air Force so far.Unsurprisingly, where there is Christian extremism, there s systemic racism as well.
So, keeping these facts in mind, the MLK Jr. Fun Shoot starts to take on a much more ominous tone.
