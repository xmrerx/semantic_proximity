21st century wire says ron paul told rt that the us shouldn t engage in death struggle over who controls aleppo.it s worth noting here that ron paul was correct back in aug. 2013 , when the us and britain were insisting the syrian government used chemical weapons against its own people in the damascus suburb of east ghouta .
at the time paul called it a false flag designed to suck us into arming jihadist rebels in syria .
where washington was demanding military strikes against syria , cooler and more intelligence heads determined that the event was in fact staged , most likely by western and gulf-backed rebels .
regarding the collapse of the ceasefire around aleppo , the former us congressman and presidential candidate said that washington should not be there [ syria ] at all , despite this being an unpopular opinion in political circles , because the intervention contributes to jihadists expanding even further .
so , i think we are doing the wrong thing , paul told rt .
i don t think it s good for our national defense .
i think it makes us more vulnerable , because it does create more enemies .
it s unpopular to suggest that maybe our presence over there contributes significantly to those who become radical jihadists and would like to do us harm .
watch paul s interview here : it s not a proper function we don t have the moral authority .
we haven t followed our own laws that said that we should not be involved in war and [ the ] overthrow of governments without a declaration of war , he said.source : rt newsread more syria news at : 21st century wire syria filessupport 21wire and its work by subscribing and becoming a member @ 21wire.tv
