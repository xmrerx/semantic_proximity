Bernie Sanders is not known to mince words and isn t shy about speaking his mind.
During the Democratic presidential debates, he couldn t have been any clearer when he summarized Republican front-runner Donald Trump.
He said: I think the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African Americans, and let s not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so-called Birther movement trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America.
Sanders makes it crystal clear why a Trump presidency has the potential to legitimize racism in the eyes of racists in America.
Since his statements against Muslims, scores of attacks on the Muslim community have occurred throughout the United States.
In addition, Trump s support of violence at his rallies with those who disagree with him have sent a message to his supporters that it s alright to use violence against those who refuse to accept the racism they support.Bernie Sanders eloquently rejected this racist ideology.
He said: You know, I find it very interesting.
My dad was born in Poland and I know a little bit about the immigrant experience.
Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate.
Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.We need someone like Bernie Sanders to unite all Americans, regardless of religion or color.Watch a video comparing these two VASTLY different canddiates below:Featured image via video screen capture
