bauchi , nigeria ( reuters ) - suspected members of islamist militant group boko haram took over a town in the restive state of borno in northeast nigeria on saturday , residents said .
the attack comes days after a suicide bomber killed at least 50 people at a mosque in neighbouring adamawa state in one of the deadliest attacks since president muhammadu buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end the eight-year insurgency .
residents said attackers entered magumeri , around 50 km ( 30 miles ) from borno state capital maiduguri , around 7:00 p.m. ( 1800 gmt ) .
they said the insurgents shot sporadically and threw explosive devices , prompting locals to flee to a forest .
we hurriedly took our families to the bushes before they could get us .
almost every resident is hiding here , said wakil bulama , one of two residents who spoke to reuters by telephone .
a military source who did not want to be identified said magumeri had been attacked but could not confirm whether it had been seized .
boko haram has waged an insurgency in northeastern nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an islamic state in the region .
the group has killed more than 20,000 and forced around 2 million people to flee their homes .
