rush limbaugh got it wrong earlier today but makes a great point about the washington elites : conservative radio great rush limbaugh announced to his audience tuesday that he s been told that george w. bush and laura bush voted for hillary clinton today , the washington examiner reports .
on one level , it s personal .
remember what trump said about jeb .
and trump has had some unkind things to say about george w. bush , limbaugh explained , referencing donald trump s habit during the republican primary of calling jeb bush low energy .
but aside from that , think about party loyalty , think about issues , think about the direction of the country , limbaugh added .
how does anybody vote for hillary clinton ?
limbaugh issued a stern warning to the elites in washington and new york , members of the club of powerful , self-interested political and media figures .
i submit to you that if you re in the club , and by the club i mean the establishment , if you are among the few elites in washington and new york that actually , for lack of a better term , run the country , you re going to hang together with other club members , limbaugh said .
that s how i think this happens .
hillary clinton s not seen as a democrat she may be , on one intramural level , an opponent , but she s certainly not an enemy when somebody outside the club happens to be running , limbaugh continued .
members of the club they re going to hang together to preserve the existence of the club and its exclusivity .
