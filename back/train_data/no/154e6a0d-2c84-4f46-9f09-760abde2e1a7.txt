juba ( reuters ) - a south sudanese army commander on trial for his role in an attack on aid workers has been found dead in military custody , an army spokesman said on friday .
the attack by soldiers at the terrain hotel in the capital juba was one of the worst on aid workers since south sudan plunged into civil war in 2013 .
the rape of five foreigners and murder of their local colleague occurred on july 11 , 2016 as president salva kiir s troops won a three-day battle in juba over opposition forces loyal to ex-vice president riek machar .
lt. col. luka akechak was found dead last weekend , army spokesman santo domic chol told reuters on friday .
chol said akechak had fallen sick some weeks ago and received medical treatment in juba but did not recover .
the military custody told us that the man was found dead in the morning .
akechak was the unit commander at the hotel on the day of the attack and is one of more than a dozen south sudanese soldiers standing trial in a military court .
the army spokesman said that in the last hearing , one of the rape survivors who testified said she witnessed akechak directing the soldiers to raid property at the hotel .
the next hearing in the trial is scheduled for wednesday .
lawyer philip manyang , who is representing survivors of the attack in court , told reuters that survivors would be testifying by video conference in a closed session .
