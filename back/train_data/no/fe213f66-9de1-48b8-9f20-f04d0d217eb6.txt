oh boy !
target customers are hot under the collar on this pc move to give toys gender neutrality .
angry customers are ditching target and have been very vocal about their displeasure on social media : @ thehill so now being pc is more important than helping customers .
no more target shopping for me target is bringing americans one step closer to a gender-neutral society .
the department store chain announced what it called something exciting friday .
after some customers complained about certain toys being designated as appropriate for girls , it is doing away with signs denoting gender classifications .
over the past year , guests have raised important questions about a handful of signs in our stores that offer product suggestions based on gender , according to target s online publication , a bullseye view .
toys no longer will be labeled according to sex and displayed on either pink or blue shelving .
gender-neutral signage also will appear in the children s bedding section .
the only place gender labels will remain is in the children s clothing department.the gender-labeling brouhaha began last june when target customer and ohio mother abi bechtel snapped a photo of target signage indicating building sets and girls building sets and tweeted it to the chain along with a stern message .
it stood out to me as a good example of the way our culture tends to view boys and men as the default , normal option , and girls and women as the specialized option , bechtel told cnn.maybe that particular sign was a bit ridiculous , but it certainly didn t require eliminating all gender classifications to correct it.oddly , target said that we use signs and displays specially designed to help guests get through the store efficiently , and signs that sort by brand , age or gender help them get ideas and find things faster .
so , the answer is to remove signs that help customers get through the store efficiently ? read more : biz pac review
