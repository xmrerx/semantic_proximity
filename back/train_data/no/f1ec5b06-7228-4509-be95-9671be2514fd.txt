as tiffany trump blew out the candles on her birthday cake , she had plenty of time to reflect in that moment on the fact that she probably made that cake herself because her family doesn t think she is important enough to acknowledge.donald trump tweeted a lot on friday ( her birthday ) and saturday , bragging about hurting the stock market , complaining about fake news and promoting candidates he likes .
though he normally ( eventually ) tweets birthday tidings to the three kids whose existence he acknowledges , he forgot all about poor tiffany ( though he did retweet promotions for his sons tv appearances ) .sadly , they and others are fake news , and the public is just beginning to figure it out !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 14 , 2017newsweek notes that melania and tiffany s siblings also completely ignored her birthday.trump has wished don jr. , melania , ivanka , eric , and even the coast guard , navy , air force , and army birthday tidings via twitter .
but not tiffany .
apparently , she isn t important enough for the donald to spend two seconds wishing her a happy birthday.in fact , he wished the navy a happy birthday instead of tiffany : i have no greater privilege than to serve as your commander-in-chief .
happy birthday to the incredible men and women @ usnavy ! # 242navybday pic.twitter.com/qcdb4u8cqa donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 13 , 2017poor tiffany .
it s unfortunate that she is forced to deal with being a member of the trump family .
