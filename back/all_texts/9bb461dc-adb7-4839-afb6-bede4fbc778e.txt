Once again, Republican front runner Donald Trump resorted to acting like a moody 5-year-old by threatening not to take part in CNN s Republican town hall scheduled for Tuesday night.
Having seen Trump engage in this childish behavior more than once before, rival candidate Ted Cruz trolled the business mogul relentlessly, explaining that Our friend Donald finds debates very, very stressful.
They make his hair stand on end.
It all started on Tuesday morning, when Trump tweeted out a whiny message to his followers that suggested he might skip the town hall because CNN had treated him unfairly by not given him enough airtime and supposedly favored his opponents by giving them more interviews:TwitterSure enough, this tweet only got the spotlight for two hours because soon word of Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski s arrest for assaulting a female reporter would make headlines and overshadow Trump s complaints.According to an analysis done by RealClearPolitics, both Cruz and Trump are tied in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the town hall is being held.
Cruz was clearly up for the challenge when he said that it s neck and neck.
Donald Trump and I are effectively tied in the state of Wisconsin.
That means any candidate running for president owes it to come in front of the state and actually debate.
Cruz insisted that Wisconsin residents deserved to see a debate between the two candidates but that he was unsure it would take place.
Still, the Texas senator continued to challenge Trump to a one-on-one standoff: We re in the same location.
They got the TV cameras; they got the moderators the one thing they re missing is The Donald.
Donald prefers to communicate in 140 characters or less.
Cruz s renewed vigor comes just after having received an endorsement from former presidential hopeful Gov.
Scott Walker (R), who said Cruz was a principled constitutional conservative who can win.
