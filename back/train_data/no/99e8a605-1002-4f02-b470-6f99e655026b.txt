podesta tells tanden the mole is eric braverman to which she replies , holy moses !
eric braverman was the ceo of the clinton foundation .
he abruptly resigned a short time later after being pushed out by long-time clinton loyalists who had apparently grown very comfortable with the status quo of accepting donations from questionable foreign donors.rumors are he fled the country we can not confirmmore on braverman : in december [ 2014 ] , the board of the bill , hillary and chelsea clinton foundation approved a salary of more than $ 395,000 , plus bonus , for its yale-educated ceo , eric braverman , while voting to extend his board term through 2017 , according to sources familiar with the arrangement .
braverman , who had worked with chelsea clinton at the prestigious mckinsey & company consultancy , had been brought in with the former first daughter s support to help impose mckinsey-like management rigor to a foundation that had grown into a $ 2 billion charitable powerhouse.but in january , only weeks after the board s show of support and just a year and a half after braverman arrived , he abruptly resigned , and sources tell politico his exit stemmed partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation .
some , including the president s old arkansas lawyer bruce lindsey , who preceded braverman as ceo , raised concerns directly to bill clinton about the reforms implemented by braverman , according to sources , and felt themselves marginalized by the growing influence of chelsea clinton and the new ceo she had helped recruit.the previously untold saga of braverman s brief , and occasionally fraught tenure trying to navigate the clintons insular world highlights the challenges the family has faced trying to impose rigorous oversight onto a vast global foundation that relies on some of the same loyal megadonors hillary clinton will need for the presidential run sources have said she is all but certain to launch later this year.already , a spate of recent news stories in politico and elsewhere have highlighted questions about the foundation s aggressive fundraising both before and during braverman s tenure , including the news that the foundation had been accepting contributions from foreign governments with lax oversight from the state department when hillary clinton was secretary of state .
the foundation has been clinton s main public platform since she left state in february 2013.the hiring a few months later of braverman , who had been a partner in mckinsey s washington office , was seen as validation of chelsea clinton s view that the foundation needed to address recommendations from a 2011 audit for tighter governance and budgeting , as well as more comprehensive policies to vet donors and avoid conflicts of interest.when braverman arrived to replace lindsey as ceo , he moved quickly to adopt the auditor s recommendations , and then some .
he diversified the foundation s board beyond the clintons and their longtime political allies and restructured its finance department .
he oversaw the creation of a $ 250 million endowment and implemented data-driven analytics to measure the effectiveness of foundation programs.no public explanation was offered for braverman s resignation .
