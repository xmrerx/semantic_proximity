Protesters were out in large numbers on Michigan Avenue today calling for the resignations of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the State s Attorney.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel spoke publicly earlier in the day and apologized for the handling of the Laquan McDonald investigation.
Protesters shut down Michigan Avenue to hurt the city in the pocketbook.
Idiotic!
They were chanting, No justice, No profit!
because they want to hurt the retail stores in the downtown area too.
They moved into the Division and State Street area but were being blocked from the Gold Coast area which is the upscale area of town.
When some of the protesters broke into an alley at North Ave. they were turned back.
Please listen to this video (if your ears can stand it) and see if you hear someone screaming, Allah Akbar!
