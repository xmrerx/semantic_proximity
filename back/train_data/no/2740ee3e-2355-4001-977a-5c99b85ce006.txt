cnn host don lemon continues to show his extreme bias when it comes to democrats vs republicans .
his most recent show of bias was his interview with a panel that included ben ferguson .
when ferguson brought up the hillary , huma , weiner scandal , lemon screamed no !
over and over again .
he thinks this is old news but it s a fact that the emails from weiner s laptop are coming out today .
we took a screenshot of lemon s smirk at the end of the video ( see below ) showing his irritation at the direction ferguson took during the interview.emails to be released today this isn t old news ! .
@ statedept will publish releasable portions of 2800 government docs that @ fbi found on anthony weiner laptop tomorrow ( dec. 29th ) .
again , thanks to @ judicialwatch lawsuits .
will @ realdonaldtrump doj finally take action on clinton/abedin misdeeds ?
