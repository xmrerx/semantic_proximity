istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish police arrested 15 senior military officers in an investigation into the network of a u.s.-based cleric who ankara accuses of orchestrating last year s attempted coup , state-run anadolu news agency said on friday .
it said police were seeking one more officer in the operation , focused on the capital ankara and spread across nine provinces , adding that 12 of the total 16 suspects were serving officers .
among the suspects were seven colonels and nine lieutenant colonels from turkey s gendarmerie force , which maintains security in rural areas , the hurriyet news website said .
more than 50,000 people , including security personnel and civil servants , have been jailed pending trial in the aftermath of the failed putsch , which the government blames on islamic preacher fethullah gulen .
he has denied involvement .
some 150,000 people have also been suspended or dismissed in a crackdown which rights groups say has been used as a pretext to muzzle dissent but which the government says has been necessary due to the security threats turkey faces .
police operations targeting alleged followers of gulen have been conducted on a near daily basis since the coup attempt in july 2016 , and authorities issued arrest warrants for 44 teachers on friday , anadolu said .
the suspects were former teachers at gulen-linked schools which were previously closed by state decree , anadolu said .
twenty-eight of the teachers were arrested so far .
schools linked to gulen s network have been established across asia , africa and the united states and since the putsch , turkey has asked countries including afghanistan and pakistan to close them down .
