The San Francisco 49ers weighed in on the national firearms debate Thursday, announcing their $500,000 donation to push for more gun control and a ban on bump stocks.The team is partnering with local and national law enforcement in an effort to create a safer America, by banning silencers and and armor piercing rounds, according to ESPN writer Nick Wagoner.A portion of the donation will also fund public service announcements geared towards police brutality and violence.Team owner Jed York was asked about his political views during an interview with reporters and said he was being painted as left-wing for pushing commonsense issues.
I m not the most left-wing person in the world.
I realize people are trying to sort of paint me as that.
That s not my background politically and how I grew up, he said.
A lot of these are commonsense issues.
When you actually sit down and talk to people and know where they re coming from, it s hard not to be sympathetic and empathetic.
The Niners have started the season 0-7 and are considered one of the worst teams in the league.
