Donald Trump s campaign has hit a new low as if it could get any worse.
According to a Politico report released on Tuesday, the current Republican front-runner has found a new way to ensure that protesters are mistreated during his rallies by using security officers in street clothes so they never see it coming.This new rally tactic was put into action during a Friday rally in New Orleans, where several plainclothes security officers were seen working.
Eddie Deck, one of these officers, said that he was told to do intelligence work researching possible protesters as well as assist any security officers in uniform.
According to the report, Black Lives Matter protesters were escorted out of the same rally by these security officers disguised in civilian s clothing.Hope Hicks, Trump s campaign spokeswoman, has not responded to Politico s request for comment.This new initiative by the campaign makes Trump s already violent rallies even more dangerous especially for minority groups, which have been routinely targeted.
Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrant groups show up at Trump s events often to oppose his offensive anti-minority stances, and are usually forcibly removed even in instances when they re being completely peaceful.
In many instances, an attack on a protester has been racially motivated.
There have also been times that Trump has actually encouraged violence or egged on his protesters, telling them that he will pay any legal fees or consequences that come of their attacks.// < !

!look at the way they treated this beautiful African American female these racist ### ######## turned the tables and you know what would happen this is what these people think about usPosted by Paul Bibbs on Tuesday, March 1, 2016But it s not just minorities that are in danger it s basically anyone that Trump feels threatened by, and you don t have to be a protester to make Trump feel insecure.
It turns out, the press makes the front runner really nervous, too.
Just last week, TIME magazine photojournalist Christopher Morris was brutally choke-slammed to the ground by one of Trump s secret service agents at a Virginia rally.New video shows Secret Service agent brutally choke slamming a photographer at Trump rally https://t.co/OkvQdWfH8r pic.twitter.com/G6dArHxoKE Mashable (@mashable) February 29, 2016And last night, Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was grabbed by the arm and thrown to the ground by Trump s own campaign manager during a press event.In most cases of horrific violence, the protesters and the press are either simply doing their jobs or being completely peaceful but they are still attacked, manhandled and thrown out.
Everyone that works with or around Trump is extremely dangerous and cannot be trusted and he keeps proving that again and again.
No one is safe at one of Trump s events, and now his concealed security officers will only make sure that people aren t able to see the danger before it s too late.Featured image via Gage Skidmore
