Donald Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that when you re a star, they let you do it, according to a video obtained by The Washington Post.The video captures Trump talking with Billy Bush, then of Access Hollywood, on a bus with the show s name written across the side.
They were arriving on the set of Days of Our Lives to tape a segment about Trump s cameo on the soap opera.The tape includes audio of Bush and Trump talking inside the bus, as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment.In that audio, Trump discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman, whose full name is not given in the video.
I moved on her, and I failed.
I ll admit it, Trump is heard saying.
It was unclear when the events he was describing took place.
The tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife, Melania.
Whoa, another voice said.
I did try and f her.
She was married, Trump says.Trump continues: And I moved on her very heavily.
In fact, I took her out furniture shopping.
She wanted to get some furniture.
I said, I ll show you where they have some nice furniture.
I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn t get there.
And she was married, Trump says.
Then all of a sudden I see her, she s now got the big phony tits and everything.
She s totally changed her look.
At that point in the audio, Trump and Bush appear to notice Arianne Zucker, the actress who is waiting to escort them into the soap-opera set.
Your girl s hot as s , in the purple, says Bush, who s now a co-host of NBC s Today show.
Whoa!
Trump says.
Whoa!
I ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her, Trump says.
You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them.
It s like a magnet.
Just kiss.
I don t even wait.
