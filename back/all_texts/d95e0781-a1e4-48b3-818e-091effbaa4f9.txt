The internet went giddy with anticipation earlier this week when a story came out of Variety Magazine claiming that Bill Nye had been invited to debate Sarah Palin on the subject of climate change after the debut of the climate-denier propaganda film Climate Hustle in early May.
Before Variety could update their article after being contacted by a Nye spokesperson with the truth, media outlets across the web had picked up and reported on the story.Before long it was trending all over social media.
Even with the story being updated with the information that Nye would only appear in pre-recorded clips, the excitement of Palin going down in flames in what would have been the butt-kicking of the century continued to spread far and wide.
Unfortunately, it isn t going to happen.
The clips of Nye will most likely be heavily edited to make it look like he s hiding something as if there s some kind of profit to be made on the hoax that the earth is getting warmer.According to Nye, the man behind the movie and the panel of experts, Marc Morano, is the guy who started the rumor in the first place.
Morano apparently used the idea of a debate between The Science Guy and the Queen of the Ditzes to promote his film.
Nye says he was never invited to any such panel to debate anything: Marc Morano did not invite me to his movie but he said I refused to come after he did invite me he was making that up.
It s disingenuous, at best.
The video is yet another beautiful and punishing blow by Bill Nye to yet another anti-science buffoon.
There s been no response from Morano, but rumor has it he s in Kentucky drinking biblical mead and licking his wounds with Ken Hamm.
