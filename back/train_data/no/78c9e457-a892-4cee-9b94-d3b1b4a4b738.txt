rome ( reuters ) - the bodies of seven migrants were discovered on wednesday in a boat adrift off libya while around 900 people were saved in operations in the southern mediterranean , italy s coastguard said .
it was one of the most intense days of rescues recorded in the area in recent months and follows a sharp fall-off in the number of migrants reaching italy .
a coastguard spokesman said the seven bodies were picked up by a boat under the command of a european union naval force operating in the mediterranean .
he had no further information about who they were or how they had died .
about 900 migrants were rescued in eight different missions , the spokesman said , adding that he expected they would be brought to italy later in the week .
migrant arrivals in italy fell 30 percent in the first eight months of the year , the interior ministry said this week , thanks mainly to a sharp decline since july when italy struck a deal with libya to block would-be asylum seekers from setting sail .
as part of the deal , the libyan coastguard has played a much more active role in preventing crossings .
earlier this week , it intercepted 299 migrants from sub-saharan african countries on two rubber boats east of tripoli , officials said .
libya s western shoreline is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach europe by boat , many of them fleeing conflict or poverty .
the interior ministry said on tuesday that between january and october , 111,397 migrants had reached italy by boat against 159,427 in the same period in 2016 .
the international organization for migration ( iom ) says that so far this year at least 2,630 people have died at sea trying to cross to italy .
