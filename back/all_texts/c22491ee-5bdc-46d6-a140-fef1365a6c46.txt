An assistant elementary school teacher from Baltimore is facing abuse charges after he threw a 7-year-old boy into a wall, breaking his jaw, all because the child was being disruptive.
Lateekqua Jackson and Trayvon Grayson Sr. say their son, Trayvon Grayson, was assaulted by an assistant teacher at City Springs Elementary/Middle School on Monday.
My son told me that [the teacher] threw my son into a wall, Jackson explained.
My son had dreams about it all last night.
He s still shaking in his sleep, saying that he keeps having visions of [the teacher] throwing him into a wall.
Jackson said that her son s jaw was broken and two of his teeth were knocked out in the violent assault.Timothy Randall Korr, who is employed by the Baltimore Curriculum Project charter operation, has been identified as the child s abuser.
Korr claims that the child was being disruptive and said he was taking the boy to the principal s office when the attack occurred, which he described as a mistake.
The teacher told me that he put him over his shoulder, and when he put him down he was bleeding, Jackson recalled.
That s it.
How can you tell somebody like that?
He said he made a mistake.
He said, I made a mistake.
It was a mistake.
That s what he said.
Child abuse detectives got a warrant for Korr s arrest after watching the disturbing footage of the appalling incident that had been caught by a security camera.
On Wednesday, the Baltimore Curriculum Project announced that Korr had been fired.
We are heartsick that this child suffered this injury, the group said in a statement.
We pray for his complete and quick recovery and for his family as well.
Korr has been charged with 1st and 2nd-degree child abuse, 1st and 2nd-degree assault, reckless endangerment and neglect of a minor.Watch more on this sickening story here: Featured image via video screen capture
