A GOP lawmaker in Oklahoma raised more than a few eyebrows when before speaking to a group of Muslim high school students, he presented them with a questionnaire that represented the worst about Islamophobia.
He even asked them, Do you beat your wife?
In Oklahoma, there s an annual Muslim Day at the Capitol, which is hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Students from Tulsa s private school for Muslims called the Peace Academy wanted to visit the office of Rep. John Bennett, but before he would meet with them, they were supposed to fill out a questionnaire from a hate group.That s according to Adam Soltani, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Oklahoma, who posted a video to Facebook shortly after the incident occurred Thursday.
I just have been informed by some of our community members that Rep. John Bennett who in my opinion, at this point, doesn t even deserve to be called a representative is refusing to meet with Muslims unless they answer questions from an Islamophobic hate group called Act For America, Soltani said in the video.Source: Huffington PostHere s some of the questionnaire:Here s the video by Adam Soltani:Bennett hasn t responded, but even beyond the fact that this is a bigoted questionnaire, this was directed at high school students!While it s tempting to blame this on Donald Trump, the hate enabler, Bennett has been on the hate train for quite a while.
In 2014, he denied that there were moderate Muslims and said that 90 percent of Islam is violent.Here s that video:Bennett, it seems, should be reminded that the vast majority of victims of terrorists are themselves Muslim.
In this country, Muslims are far more likely to be victims of terrorism (hate crimes) than to initiate terrorism, but we ll never hear that from the occupant of the White House.
Instead, Republicans will just spread the idea that high school students might beat their wives.Featured image via video screen capture
