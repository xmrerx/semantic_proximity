( reuters ) - british police said on tuesday they had released three men who were arrested in connection with the bomb attack on a london underground train earlier this month .
six people have now been released out of the seven arrested during the investigation into the sept. 15 attack at parsons green station in west london , london s metropolitan police said in a statement .
the one person who remains in custody is 18-year-old ahmed hassan , arrested in dover , kent , a day after the incident .
hassan appeared in court on friday charged with attempting to murder passengers on board the train heading to central london from the southwest suburb of wimbledon .
he was also charged with causing an explosion likely to endanger life using the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide ( tatp ) known as the mother of satan or another explosive substance .
the attack , using a home-made bomb that apparently failed to fully explode , was britain s fifth major security incident this year and injured 29 people on a packed rush-hour commuter train .
the islamic state militant group , which had said it was behind several attacks on western cities in recent years , including two attacks in london and one in manchester this year , claimed responsibility for the latest attack .
