21st Century Wire says Here is a perfect example of a story where the mainstream media will treat the surface narrative without identifying the real underlying scoop The Reuters report below reveals how a recent police raid of a phony back alley US Embassy in the African capital city of Accra, Ghana, netted seizures of a number of illicit travel documents, including authentic European Union Schengen Zone travel visas.
It turns out that this organized crime operation was being run by a Turkish crime syndicate This is distrurbing when considered in conjunction with recent demands by Turkey and its President Tayip Erdo an, to be given Schengen Zone free travel throughout the EU for all Turkish citizens (Image Source: California Courier)Last year, Turkey was effectively using the Syrian refugee crisis to blackmail the EU into paying Ankara 3 Billion Euros in cash as well as Schengen free movement for Turks in and out of the EU.

Terrorism and organized crime go hand in hand.
Can the Turkish government, who is already implicated in aiding and abetting terrorist fighters along its Jihadi Highway, really guarantee that there will not be mass document fraud including Turkish passports for various terrorists moving freely throughout its country?The Ghana syndicate shows just how deeply entrenched Turkish organized crime is in the business of forging visa travel documents.

Investigations also uncovered a fake Dutch embassy, the State Department said.Officials in the Netherlands were not immediately reachable for comment on Sunday.The crime ring issued fraudulently obtained but legitimate US visas and false identification documents, including birth certificates at a cost of $6,000 ( 4,700) each, the statement said.During raids that led to a number of arrests, authorities also seized authentic and counterfeit Indian, South African and Schengen zone visas and 150 passports from 10 different countries along with a laptop and smartphones Continue this article at The GuardianREAD MORE TURKEY NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Turkey Files
