Political cartoons are usually awesomely hilarious, and they also generally have more than a little truth to them.
Case in point a cartoon posted on the Washington Post s opinion blog today that needed no words when showing just what happened as House Speaker Paul Ryan finally lost what little spine he had and endorsed Donald Trump.You see, Speaker Ryan, for a very short time, actually strongly resisted Trump.
He rightly called Trump s plans to ban all Muslims from traveling to the United States Un-American, and he also called Trump out for not immediately disavowing the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon David Duke and other white supremacist organizations.
However, all of Paul Ryan s concerns about Trump have suddenly gone out the window, and the spineless Speaker of the House is now happily endorsing the brainless, bombastic, racist narcissist who is now the official 2016 GOP presidential nominee.The thing is, Ryan s infamous spinelessness is what is behind this endorsement.
From his previous statements, he clearly knows how absolutely dangerous Trump is, but he doesn t care.
He, like other GOPers who initially resisted Trump are content to put party before country and hell, even before the safety of the world and the human race as we know it and happily take it up the ass from Trump if it means keeping Democrats out of power.So, without further ado, here is just what happened as Paul Ryan jumped on the Trump Train:And there you have it.
Keep kissing the dirtiest asshole in America, Speaker Ryan.
