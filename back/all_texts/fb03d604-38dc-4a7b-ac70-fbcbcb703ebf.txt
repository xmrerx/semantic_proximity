NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Hurricane Maria totally obliterated the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico with its electrical grid destroyed.
Trump told reporters during a meeting with Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko that he would visit Puerto Rico at some point.
He did not specify a time.
He described Puerto Rico as in very, very, very perilous shape and said U.S. emergency authorities were starting to work on helping in the recovery.
