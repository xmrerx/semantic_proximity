A new ad from a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC hits Donald Trump for his dishonorable attacks on the family of Captain Humayun Khan, who died serving in the U.S. Army in Iraq.The ad from Priorities USA features Michelle DeFord, the mother of David Johnson, a National Guardsman who died while operating as a gunner on a Humvee in Iraq.Speaking about Trump s attacks on the Khan family in the ad, Deford says, When I saw Donald Trump attack another Gold Star mother, I felt such a sense of outrage.
I would like to tell Donald Trump, she continues, what it feels like.
The sense of emptiness that only losing a child can bring.
Those people should be honored and treated with kindness for the rest of their life.
Trump s attacks on the Khan family have been widely condemned by both Democrats and Republicans.
Recent polls have shown that the vast majority of Americans over 60 percent believe that Trump s smears, over multiple days, were far over the line of acceptable political behavior.The Washington Post recently reported that Trump suffers in the election from the perception that he lacks basic human decency about what should and should not be said in the course of a campaign.Several Gold Star families, who have lost their sons and daughters in war zones, have condemned Trump for his behavior and demanded an apology (he has not given one).On the other side, many of Trump s most ardent supporters not only support the attack on the Khan family but have furthered multiple conspiracy theories and rumors about them, while some have even attacked their dead son and called him either a traitor or a phony.Republicans have always enjoyed strong support among the military, it remains to be seen if the nominee attacking a Purple Heart winner and his family will do anything to erode that going forward.Featured image via YouTube
