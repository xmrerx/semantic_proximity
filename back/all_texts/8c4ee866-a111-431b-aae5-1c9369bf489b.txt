MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Moscow on Wednesday that it was important not to allow a repeat of U.S. strikes in Syria.
Lavrov said the strikes carried out by the United States on a Syrian airbase last week were unlawful.
He added that he expected to hold frank and honest discussions with Tillerson on forming a broad anti-terrorism coalition.
