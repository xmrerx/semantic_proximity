former secret service agent dan bongino has an explanation of the hometown identity of politicians and how it leads to an insider swamp creature like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell.bongino defended president trump and dismissed criticism by former director of national intelligence james clapper who questioned trump s fitness for office following a rally in phoenix , arizona .
they just don t understand trump .
he s a queens guy , bongino said on fox & friends thursday.our previous report on james clapper trying to slam trump s fitness for office : former director of national intelligence james clapper was way out of line and way too political last night when he showed his cards bigtime on president trump .
he followed the latest leftist line that trump isn t fit to serve yes , the loony left has a new play book that makes the false claim that somehow trump is unfit to be president.we ve reported on clapper before but his not wittingly comment before the senate is legend .
remember when he was asked if the nsa spies on americans and he replied not wittingly ?
yes , well , that was perjury.more recently clapper bashed president trump during a discussion on national security and the trump/russia fake scandal.it s clear that clapper is a political pawn who is out to try and make our president look bad .
this is serious deep state stuff.we re sure this isn t the end of james clapper s involvement in the opposition to president trump .
