If America is going to end the day Donald Trump takes the nomination at the GOP convention, Stephen Colbert was not going to miss out on mocking it.During the Late Show on Thursday night, Colbert relentlessly mocked the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for running his campaign like a reality show because he wants to wait until the convention in Cleveland to announce his vice presidential running mate.
It s an apt metaphor, because this year s Republican convention will be the series finale of America, Colbert quipped.
I can t wait to see the in memoriam reel for liberty.
With that said, Colbert and his team put together a hilarious ad fittingly describing the convention and how it might go down.
In short, just like a monster truck rally.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday July 18-21, a four-day television event that s going to rock what s left of America.
It s the Trump Republican National Convention.
There s going to be yelling, angry white men, hats with words on them.
Watch Donald Trump rope and brand a naked Ted Cruz but that s not all.
Touch real brains at Dr. Ben Carson s freakatorium, and don t miss the marital cage match three wives enter, one wife leaves.
And someone will be punched.
Plus, Donald will announce his running mate, Truckasaurus.
July 18-21, come one, come all unless you re a Muslim or a Mexican or a woman who s not a 10.
Here s the video:Yeah, that s definitely the perfect way to think about the Republican National Convention.
It s nothing more than a glorified monster truck rally for redneck racists who want to see America come to an embarrassing end.Hopefully, most Americans are watching the GOP s Trump circus in utter horror and will be highly motivated to vote in November against it.
If not, we all better get ready to kiss civilization goodbye.Featured image via screenshot
