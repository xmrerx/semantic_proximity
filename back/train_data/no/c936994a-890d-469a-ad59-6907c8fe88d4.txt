irish journalist and documentary filmmaker ann mcelhinney took down a clueless liberal student during a discussion on global warming ann is the quickest and smartest at debate .
this liberal picked on the wrong person the student insults ann with the following comment : i can t take anything you said seriously because you said that washing machines were more liberating than the birth control pill , the student yelled as a friend tried to calm her .
you don t know anything !
you are the least credible human being i ve like ever encountered in my life .
she then called ann a goddamn idiot .
ann proceeded to give this student a big reality check on the eu and then american exceptionalism .
bravo ann ! on a side note- if you ever have the chance to hear ann mcelhinney speak , do it !
she is one of the best speakers around ! we ve had the pleasure of hearing her speak and came away very impressed ! her latest project is on the gosnell abortion case :
