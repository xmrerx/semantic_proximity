Comedian Bill Maher is no fan of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
While, during the Democratic primary, Maher was a supporter of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, he has urged everyone to get in line behind Hillary Clinton, and has been singing her praises and slamming Trump ever since.We are all aware by now that Hillary, like any human being does at times, has gotten sick.
Her campaign announced that she has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and she left a 9/11 memorial service in New York City abruptly because she was dehydrated and overheated.
This stirred up the feverish hopes on the Right that she is somehow unfit to be president due to health concerns.
Of course, this is ridiculous; she ll be fine.
Her doctor has examined her and she is recovering nicely.That is where comedian Bill Maher comes in.
He tweeted that he would vote for Dead Hillary over Trump.Pneumonia?
I'd vote for Dead Hillary in this race.
She could be Patient Zero for Bubonic Plague, still better than #TangerineNightmare Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 13, 2016This will be seen as inappropriate by some, as joking about death isn t necessarily the best thing to do, but Maher s message is clear: Hillary in any condition is a much better choice than Trump on his best day, with his best behavior.
In short, sane people know that Donald Trump is in no way fit for the presidency, and he is, in fact, nothing more than a dangerous demagogue who should have never gotten this close to the White House.Do as Maher says, for the sake of the nation VOTE BLUE in November.Featured image via David Becker/WireImage
