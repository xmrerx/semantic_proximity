The woman in the video isn t Swedish, but her husband is.
She recalls a Sweden that used to be clean, safe and peaceful when she was a teenager.
Today she claims that when she walks the streets, all that she sees are, hijabs, burqas and looting foreign men who stand on corners and cat call her, and men who lifestream gang rapes while they throw rocks at cops.
Mr. Trump, please keep talking about Sweden.
Sweden calls upon our @POTUS for help !
Please share as much as possible!
Stop the madness!
