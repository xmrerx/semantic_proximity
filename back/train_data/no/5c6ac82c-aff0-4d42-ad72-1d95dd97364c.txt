bogota ( reuters ) - armed gunmen this week killed six former fighters from colombia s farc rebels , the now-demobilized group said , reiterating its fears about attacks targeting former guerrillas .
thousands of members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) rebels handed in their weapons under a peace deal signed with the government last year to end more than 53 years of war .
the group is now a political party .
sunday s killings took place in the restive southwestern province of narino , where criminal gangs , the smaller eln rebel group and farc dissidents who refused to demobilize are competing to control valuable territory for the cultivation of coca , the base ingredient in cocaine .
we stand in solidarity with the families of our six comrades who were cowardly murdered in cold blood , the farc said in a statement .
the armed groups trying to take over territory in the area have no ideological aims , the farc said on its website , but are stoking violence for economic gain .
former rebel leaders have repeatedly raised concerns that former guerrillas may be assassinated by right-wing paramilitary gangs or drug traffickers , in a replay of about 5,000 targeted killings during the 1980s , when the group first attempted to found a political party .
