CA now a Sanctuary State; Dreams may become Nightmares pic.twitter.com/8gKfHseZcL Eye On The Sparrow (@2Chron169) September 19, 2017Nancy Pelosi was left shaken and befuddled on Monday when open borders advocates crashed her press conference and refused to leave.
A group of about 30 so-called DREAMers surrounded her and shouted chants like You are a liar!
The press conference devolved into a shouting match between Pelosi and the ringleader of the group who busted into the meeting:Pelosi shouted: If you do not want to listen!
The group of about thirty shouted back: Where were you when we asked?
And now you have the audacity to tell us that you have been fighting deportation!
Pelosi protested with: Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, I am!
Yes, I am!
The illegals screamed: You are a liar!
They held up a sign saying Democrats are Deporters A LITTLE LONGER VERSION:This is when Pelosi lost it and fell apart.
She said, You don t know what you re talking about.
You can see she s clearly shaken during the exchange.
The left is getting what they deserve.
