tillerson , who held talks with iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi in baghdad this week , was asked by reporters in geneva about blunting iran s influence .
what we are saying to the iraqis is you must develop the capacity to stand on your own , he said .
the united states remained very concerned about the fighting that has erupted between iraqi security forces and the kurdish peshmerga militia over the kurdish independence referendum , tillerson said .
he said that the united states was disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution and that he had encouraged abadi to accept erbil s ( the kurdistan regional government s ) overtures for talks on the basis of the iraqi constitution .
