ivanka trump decided on tuesday evening to send out a tweet in honor of world refuge day , and once again , she apparently forgot who her father is .
on # worldrefugeeday we remember the plight & courage of the 22 million+ refugees globally .
we must work to restore peace & end this crisis , she wrote , seemingly oblivious to the cruel and bigoted stance her own father has taken against refugees.on # worldrefugeeday we remember the plight & courage of the 22 million+ refugees globally .
