Klayman Discusses Complaint Against Rep. Adam Schiff for Obstruction of Justice & Ethics Violations Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics.
Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committee s Russia investigation.
Remember when he came out and spoke to the press after speaking to the president?
Well, the Democrats raised heck after that and have done everything they can to stop Nunes.
Note that he has left his position only temporarily.
Trey Gowdy and others will take his place FLASHBACK ON NUNES:1.)
On numerous occasions the [Obama] intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.
2.)
Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration; details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.
3.)
Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition members were unmasked.
4.)
Fourth and finally, I want to be clear; none of this surveillance was related to Russia, or the investigation of Russian activities, or of the Trump team.
