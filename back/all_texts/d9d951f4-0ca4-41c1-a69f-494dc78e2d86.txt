GOP Presidential candidate and religious right poster boy Mike Huckabee was confronted over his relationship with the Duggar family and decided to browbeat an Iowa voter for pointing out his dysfunctional relationship.The voter asked Huckabee why he announced support for the Duggar family, pointing out he propped up child abuse and the subsequent cover up of that abuse while attaching himself to Josh Duggar, who molested five girls.
The Duggars have been influential with the religious right, a key constituency of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee s support base.In response Huckabee melted down, accusing the woman of making a scene and getting her facts about the case.Huckabee yelled at the woman and insisted that because he had known the Duggar children since they were babies she had no right to speak out about how the Duggar family patriarch, Jim Bob Duggar, had avoided reporting his son s abuse towards young children.But the voter was right.
Huckabee had backed the Duggars.When the revelations about Duggar came out, Huckabee announced he was still backing the Duggar clan.Janet and I want to affirm our support for the Duggar family.
Josh s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself, inexcusable, but that doesn t mean unforgivable.
He and his family dealt with it and were honest and open about it with the victims and the authorities.
No purpose whatsoever is served by those who are now trying to discredit Josh or his family by sensationalizing the story.
Good people make mistakes and do regrettable and even disgusting things.Yet as the campaign heated up and media scrutiny increased, Huckabee apparently felt the heat and scrubbed his campaign website of material showing the Duggar connection.So far Huckabee has been able to capture the magic of his 2008 campaign when he won the Iowa caucuses.
He has been unable to qualify for the top-tier debates and currently polls at an average of 2% among Republicans.
In all likelihood Huckabee will return to the lucrative world of being a Fox News pundit and cranking out history propaganda videos targeted at impressionable children.Featured image via YouTube
