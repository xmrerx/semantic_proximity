would think would enough selfawareness enough journalistic integrity enough concern image
keep come pile higher deeperone latest case point review new biography mikhail gorbachev new york time book review september 10
review say gorbachev hero people destroyer empire
new york time avoid say anything positive life soviet union socialism
would reader believe loss like czechoslovakia hungary et al
upset russian people loss gorbachev perestroika decent standard living loss affect people rent employment vacation medical care education many aspect soviet welfare stateaccompanying review quote 1996 time review gorbachev memoir say mystify westerner mikhail gorbachev loathe ridicule country
man pull world several step back nuclear brink lift crush fear countryman end bloody foreign adventure liberated eastern europe
