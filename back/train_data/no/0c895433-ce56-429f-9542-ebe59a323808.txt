we were on the plane about an hour , having dinner , and then something fell on my head , so i grabbed it .
i was hanging onto it , bell said in a skype interview .
it was lucky that it hit my nail more than my skin i think , so maybe my thumbnail saved me a little bit .

our crew immediately consulted with a medlink physician on the ground who provided guidance throughout the incident and assured our crew that it was not a life-threatening matter .
medical personnel met the aircraft after it arrived in calgary , united said in a statement .
cbs newssadly , this scary incident took place the same day that a passenger was filmed as he was being dragged off a united flight from chicago to louisville by the airport police .
