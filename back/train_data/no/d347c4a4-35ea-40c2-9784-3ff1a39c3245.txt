after 18 months of rampant speculation over trump and russian collusion and alleged russian hacking in the 2016 election , in a cloud of non-stop , 24/7 fake news being generated by cnn , abc , nbc , cbs , washington post , new york times , la times , as well as notorious msm fake news outsourcing agencies like the daily beast the never trump resistance has yet to present a single item of evidence to justify their year and a half-long political witch hunt.in this sea of delusion , there are still a number of desperate media persons who are willing to punt on a contrived plot or narrative hoping that theirs will be the one to finally nail the embattled president on grounds for impeachment beyond a reasonable doubt .
already a number of mainstream journalists , including three reporters from cnn , have been fired or let go as networks are now fear legal repercussions from their new normalized practice of lying and inventing plots about the white house and russian meddling .
this week saw another high-profile casualty , abc s chief investigative correspondent brian ross , as the resistance continues to launch blind media attacks on the president.on saturday , abc news executives announced that star anchor ross would be suspended for one month without pay over an alleged botched exclusive implicating former national security adviser michael flynn.clueless : abc s chief investigative correspondent brian ross.during ross s live special report , an invented story-line was fed to a clueless ross which claimed that flynn would testify that donald trump had ordered him to make contact with russians about foreign policy while trump was still a candidate in the general election.according to fox news , the fake news report raised the specter of trump s impeachment and sent the stock market plummeting .
later in the day , abc issued a clarification to ross s report , saying that trump s alleged directive came after he d been elected president .
ross himself appeared on world news tonight , several hours after the initial report , to clarify his error.afterwards , abc news tried to justify the fake news release , claiming that ross report had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process .
clearly , ross took one for the team ( the resistance ) here , as anyone who works in media will know .
he would have been fed the bogus report by news producers , before doing what mainstream media news anchors do everyday of their careers unwittingly reading whatever words are scrolling down his teleprompter.abc news statement went on to try and gloss over their fake news report saying , it is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience .
news officials then sounded even more ridiculous as they scrambled to pave-over their propaganda practices claiming that , these are our core principles .
we fell far short of that yesterday .
what s clear from this story is that when it comes to all things trump and russia , the us mainstream media feel they are within their right to dispense with all normal journalistic standards so long as the story falls in line with a specific political agenda.unfortunately , this is just one more reason to always be cautious when trusting watching mainstream media reporting of any any major news event.read more about mainstream fake news at : 21st century wire fake news filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @ 21wire.tv
