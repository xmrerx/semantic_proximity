brussels ( reuters ) - the european union s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier said on friday it was not possible to put a concrete figure on the amount of money britain will have to pay the eu upon exiting the bloc because numbers may change in the future .
i have never quoted any figures and will not start today ... because they can change , barnier told a news conference .
he said he was satisfied with the agreement between the eu and britain that no eu country , including britain , would have to pay more or receive less as a result of britain s decision to leave the bloc in 2019 .
