SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said on Monday North Korea is on a reckless path with its continued nuclear and missile provocations in defiance of international condemnation.
The price of its continued provocations in blatant disregard of the peace-loving members of the international community will be instability and economic hardship, Kang told a news conference.
Her comments come hours before the U.N. Security Council was to vote on fresh a U.S.-drafted resolution imposing new sanctions to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs.
