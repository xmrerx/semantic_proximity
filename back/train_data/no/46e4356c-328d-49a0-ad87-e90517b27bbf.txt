sydney ( reuters ) - a senior australian government minister on thursday called donald trump ’ s campaign for the u.s. presidency “ terrifying ” and warned it risked casting the republican party into the wilderness if he wins nomination .
australian government ministers rarely make critical comments about elections in other countries , especially stalwart allies like the united states , which australia relies on heavily for military backing in the asia-pacific .
australian industry minister christopher pyne , a cabinet member of the ruling conservative liberal-national coalition , criticized the violence at recent trump rallies and said that his rise was casting a pall over american democracy .
“ now , democracy should be robust but it certainly shouldn ’ t be violent , ” pyne said in an interview on australia ’ s channel seven television network .
“ and i think the donald trump phenomenon is a real problem for the united states , making their democracy look kind of weird , ” he said .
republican front-runner trump warned on wednesday of riots if he is denied the party ’ s presidential nomination , only days after trump supporters and protesters clashed at a rally for the republican in chicago that was later scrapped .
republican party leaders are appalled at trump ’ s incendiary rhetoric and reject policies such as his vow to deport 11 million illegal immigrants , temporarily ban muslims from the united states and build a wall along the mexican border .
the party tried to play down trump ’ s riot comments , which have raised the temperature even more in a heated white house race .
