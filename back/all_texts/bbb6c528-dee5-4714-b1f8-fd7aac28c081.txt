Daniel Pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on Eric Garner, killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes.
There was a lengthy investigation, but ultimately no indictment, despite public outrage and widespread protests.
Now, a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the NYPD was with Pantaleo and his deadly actions.Ever since Pantaleo killed Garner on that New York City street, he has consistently gotten raise after raise, even while being actively investigated for Garner s death, and is now making upwards of $120,000 a year.A report from Politico reads: Pantaleo earned $119,996 in fiscal year 2016, which includes earnings between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016.
His base pay was $78,026 and he earned $23,220 in overtime, according to a review of payroll records.
He received an additional $12,853 in unspecified pay, which could include retroactive pay or bonuses.Pantaleo s earnings in 2016 represent a 35 percent increase in overtime pay, and a 14 percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year, which began shortly before Garner s death on July 17, 2014.In that 12-month period, ending June 30, 2015, Pantaleo earned $105,061, with $76,488 base pay, $17,109 in overtime and $11,673 in additional earnings, records show.In fiscal year 2014, which was completed before Garner s death and Pantaleo s subsequent reassignment, he made $99,915, which included $17,189 in overtime.
An investigation into Garner s killing by the Department of Justice is ongoing and the NYPD has still not released the results of their investigation.
Mayor Bill DeBlasio insists that state law prevents Pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released.
This claim prompted Governor Andrew Cuomo to call bullshit and he told DeBlasio not to blame the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge.
So far, this is what we do know about Pantaleo s record as one of New York s finest, according to Latest.com: Pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a (black) citizen s civil rights.
He was disciplined for a bogus stop and frisk incident before the NYPD banned the practice.
In April he was named as a defendant with the NYPD for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver.
So in America, when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof, not only does he get a paid vacation, he also gets one hell of a pay raise.
