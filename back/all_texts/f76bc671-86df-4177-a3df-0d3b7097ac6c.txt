An interracial couple in Olympia, Washington, was stabbed by a man sporting white supremacist tattoos and markings.
The attacker appeared to have racist feelings and spoke out against Black Lives Matter, according to an account of his questioning by police.The accused, 32-year-old Daniel Rowe, had tattoos on his body reading skinhead, white power, and in the shape of the Confederate flag.
The man in the couple he went after sustained non-life threatening injuries while the woman was grazed by his knife in the attack.Upon his arrest, Rowe allegedly told police that he had gone downtown after hearing about anti-police graffiti that had been put up Sunday night, according to court documents.
He reportedly told police that if he were let go, he would head to a Donald Trump rally and stomp out more of the Black Lives Matter group.
This has all the hallmarks of a hate crime, said Deputy Prosecutor Joseph Wheeler.
This black-and-white couple was simply expressing their love for one another, he added.Black Lives Matter has been demonized both by conservative politicians and right-wing media like Fox News Channel, where host Bill O Reilly has compared the movement to the Ku Klux Klan.This is not the first apparent hate crime to be connected to Trump s campaign.
In addition to various non-criminal incidents around the country, a Latino man in Massachusetts was beaten up by Trump fans as they cited the candidate and discussed deporting him.Trump himself has directed his rally attendees to be violent towards protesters, including those there on behalf of Black Lives Matter.
Trump publicly offered to pay the legal bills for one man who punched a protester, and cheered on the idea of punching people who disrupt his events.By comparison, Hillary Clinton has said black lives matter, and has featured mothers who have lost a child as a result of police brutality as part of her campaign as the Mothers of the Movement.
