lashkar gah , afghanistan ( reuters ) - an airstrike by the afghan air force on a checkpoint in gereshk district in the southern province of helmand on sunday killed around 10 members of the security forces and wounded nine others , officials said .
the strike hit members of a special militia unit known as sangoryan , who wear local clothes to blend into areas where the taliban are active .
omar zwak , a spokesman for the provincial governor , confirmed the incident but gave no details .
the incident is the latest in a series of so-called friendly fire accidents in helmand , the most recent in july when a u.s. airstrike killed a number of local police members during an operation in gereshk district .
in another incident , in june , at least three members of the afghan border police were killed when a u.s. military aircraft opened fire on them during an operation in southern afghanistan .
large parts of helmand , afghanistan s major opium-producing province , are in the hands of the taliban .
u.s. and afghan commanders see air power as a vital weapon to prevent the area falling completely to the insurgents .
building up afghanistan s own air power is a central part of president ashraf ghani s four-year strategic plan and the afghan air force has steadily bolstered its capacity to provide logistical support to ground forces as well as air strikes .
but one consequence has been an increase in the number of unintended casualties caused by accidents .
according to u.n. figures published in july , there was a 43 percent increase in the number of civilian casualties caused by u.s. and afghan airstrikes in the first half of the year .
