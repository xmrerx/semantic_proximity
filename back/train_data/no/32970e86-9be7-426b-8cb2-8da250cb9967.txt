bangkok ( reuters ) - armed insurgents stopped and torched a bangkok-bound passenger bus on a highway in southern thailand on sunday , police said .
all 14 passengers , as well as the bus driver and his assistance , survived the attack , although their luggage were burned with the bus .
the attack occurred in yala , one of the predominantly ethnic malay muslim provinces in the south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for more than a decade .
more than 6,500 people have been killed since 2004 .
police said at least 10 gunmen were involved in the latest attack .
they all escaped , blocking the road with tree trunks and nails to thwart any pursuers .
an army spokesman was not available for comment .
as with most violence in thailand s deep south , there was no claim of responsibility .
the insurgents are fighting for secession from predominantly buddhist thailand .
thailand s military government has , since 2015 , held talks brokered by malaysia , aim at ending the violence .
the process , which aim to established a safety-zone as a confidence-building measure by early next year , has been stalled .
