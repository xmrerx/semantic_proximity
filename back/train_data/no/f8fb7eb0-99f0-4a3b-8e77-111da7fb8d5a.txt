wellington ( reuters ) - support for new zealand s opposition labour party was neck-and-neck with the national party , a poll showed , threatening the center-right government s decade-long grip on power .
backing for labour had surged 7 points to 39.5 percent , virtually even with national on 40 percent , a roy morgan poll showed on friday .
the result highlights the unusually tight race to the vote on sept. 23 , with surveys by separate pollsters this week showing both national and labour in the lead .
the narrow gap between the major parties means the final outcome of the election will be decided by the second string parties and it is here that labour has a decisive edge , gary morgan , the pollster s executive chair , said on its website .
labour s possible coalition partner , the green party , posted support of 9 percent , putting the pair in a strong position to form a government with the smaller m ori party , whose support was 2 percent .
the nationalist new zealand first party dropped 2.75 points to just 6 percent , making it less likely that labour would need the populist party to form a government .
