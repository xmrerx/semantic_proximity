If there is one reason to vote for Hillary Clinton, it will be because of one thing: Republicans will become obsolete.At least that s what Ann Coulter thinks.
The polemic, bigoted and hateful author, a firebrand in the conservative arena, gave us the best possible reason to choose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.
Should Clinton win, everyone on the Republican side from talk radio hosts, to Fox News, to future candidates, will be out of the game, and Democrats will reign supreme.Clinton contends that Clinton, if elected, will grant amnesty to 30, 40 million illegal immigrants (even though the number may be lower than 11 million), and will quadruple the number of Muslim refugees coming into the country.
Should that happen, there will be no hope for any Republican ever winning another election.
Not only that, but Coulter predicted her future if Clinton becomes president: There s no point to what I do, what talk radio hosts do, what Fox News does.
Nobody goes to the game when you can t win.
For once, Coulter and I agree on something.
There is no point to anything she or Fox News does.
So forget the Supreme Court, forget income inequality, forget our standing in the world there is now at least one reason why all Democrats, liberals, progressives and Independents alike should come together vote for Hillary Clinton come November: To put Ann Coulter out of business.The 10-time New York Times bestselling author has already gone on the record saying she will instead write cookbooks and crime novels if Trump loses.Some liberal writers and pundits would lose material with her gone, but for the greater good, the trade off isn t shabby.Coulter has been one of Trump s biggest supporters and surrogates, even going as far as writing a new book, completely dedicated to holding up the billionaire candidate as a god-like figure, called In Trump We Must.
