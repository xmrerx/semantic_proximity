strasbourg , france ( reuters ) - members of the european commission will have to wait two years before taking up new employment after they quit the eu executive under a new ethical code of conduct proposed by the president of the commission on wednesday .
seeking to bolster the public s trust in the eu institutions , jean-claude juncker called for more enforced ethical standards and greater transparency in the commission .
the code of conduct will be enforced from feb. 1 , 2018 , and will apply to all current members .
this comes after juncker s predecessor jose manuel barroso caused public uproar after joining u.s. investment bank goldman sachs to advise it on brexit , and former commissioner neelie kroes was reprimanded for not declaring income that would effectively have reduced her pension .
the cooling off period between a commission term and the start of new employment was extended from 18 months to two years for members and three years for the president .
the code also requires members to declare investments above 10,000 euro ( $ 11,900 ) and establishes an independent ethical committee to advise on all ethical issues .
