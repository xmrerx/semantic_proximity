Pointing to Donald Trump s recent comments on abortion and controversial appointment of an extremist right favorite to the White House, Mayor de Blasio on Monday urged all Americans to continue protesting the President-elect.De Blasio, speaking after days of roiling protests against the country s yet-to-be-sworn-in 45th president have sprung up in New York and other cities, said resistance is necessary, especially since Trump is likely to lose the popular vote and therefore doesn t have a mandate to rule.De Blasio said, We need to hold Trump accountable for anything he does that encourages hate and division The more extreme he is, the more people fight back, the more it takes away his power.
With Bill de Blasio making headlines for fanning the flames of racial tension between police and protesters it s worth recalling newsworthy information about the New York City mayor s dark past; that he was an active supporter of a brutal communist regime well known as one of the worst human rights abusers in Latin America.Judicial Watch uncovered and reported the scandalous details last year.
De Blasio was an active supporter of the communist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua in the 1980s.
He was so enamored with Soviet-backed revolutionaries that he traveled to the capital city of the war-torn country, Managua, to aid their cause by participating in a relief mission.
Upon de Blasio s return to the United States, he joined the Nicaragua Solidarity Network of Greater New York (NSN).-JWThe mayor also said that Trump s comments on the campaign trail about stepping up stop and frisk wouldn t happen in New York as long as he s mayor.
That s not going to happen on my watch, the mayor said.
