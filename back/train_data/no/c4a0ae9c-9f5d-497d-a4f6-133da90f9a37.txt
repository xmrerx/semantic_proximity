kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - malaysian authorities scrapped an annual beer festival on monday after an islamist party objected to the event that had been planned for the first weekend of october in the country s capital .
though there are plenty of beer drinkers among the sizable chinese and indian minorities , protests against events deemed to be western and unislamic - such as concerts and festivals involving alcohol - are common in muslim-majority malaysia and are usually led by the pan-malaysian islamic party ( pas ) .
kuala lumpur city hall ( dbkl ) said in a short statement on monday that it has rejected the application for a permit by the organizers of the better beer festival 2017 to host the event , which would have entered its sixth year .
if the organizers continue with the event without dbkl s approval , action will be taken in accordance to existing laws , city hall said .
mybeer ( m ) sdn bhd , the company organizing the event , said in a separate statement that they were informed by dbkl officials that the decision was made due to the political sensitivity surrounding the event .
a member of pas central committee , riduan mohd nor , said in a statement on sept. 10 that there is no guarantee that such events would not lead to criminal acts , rape and free sex .
opponents of the beer festival also launched a campaign on facebook to block the event .
around 6,000 people had been expected to attend the two-day festival , which would have featured craft beers from at least 11 countries , according to facebook posts by the organizers and local news reports .
