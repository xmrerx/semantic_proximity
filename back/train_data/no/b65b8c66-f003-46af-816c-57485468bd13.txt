manila ( reuters ) - more than a week after the philippines declared victory over pro-islamic state militants in marawi , security officials on friday expressed concern over lone wolf attacks , with australia issuing a high threat alert about travel to manila .
skirmishes continued between soldiers and holdouts from the islamist militant group that seized a lakeside town on the southern island of mindanao .
more than 1,100 people , including 165 troops , were killed in the five-month conflict .
one concern after marawi is the possibility of threats from lone wolves , defense department spokesman arsenio andolong told reporters , two days after an uzbek plowed into new york pedestrians and bikers in what u.s. officials called a terrorist act .
the army remained on high alert after president rodrigo duterte said five cities in mindanao were potential targets of islamist militants after their defeat in marawi , he added .
on friday , the australian embassy issued a travel advisory , warning of a high threat of terrorist attack in the philippines , including manila , the capital .
be alert to possible threats around locations that have a low level of protective security and places known to be possible terrorist targets , it said .
it told australians to reconsider travel plans to eastern mindanao and avoid its central and western regions .
the advisory was similar to one issued early this year , said military spokesman major-general restituto padilla .
it was only a reiteration , there is no credible threat , he added .
two days ago , army soldiers killed the righthand man of abu sayyaf leader isnilon hapilon , the emir of pro-islamic state militants in southeast asia , who was gunned down last month .
his death hastened the collapse of the marawi-based militant group , leading to its defeat .
