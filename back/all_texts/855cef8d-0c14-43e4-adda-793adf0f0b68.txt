The Army Corps of Engineers has denied an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline, a major oil pipeline that had been rerouted to go through a Sioux nation reservation, and under the Missouri River.
Protesters and police have been clashing repeatedly at Standing Rock in North Dakota over the possibility that the pipeline will contaminate water supplies for the Standing Rock Sioux.The Daily Beast is reporting that the Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement pending an environmental impact study.
NBC 4 Washington has just released a statement from Sioux chairman David Archambault II that says: I heard the army Corp [sic] of engineers will not grant the easement and they will reroute.
NBC 4 reports that Archambault also said: I am thankful there were some leaders in the feral [sic] government that realized something was not right even though its [sic] legal.
For the first time in hisopry [sic] native American, they heard our voices.
This is something that will go down in history and is a blessing for all indigenous people.
Protesters have been gathering at Standing Rock for months to support the Sioux in their fight against the pipeline, and within the last few days, military veterans began heading out in support of the protests and to form a shield around the camp.
Methods of trying to get the protesters to leave, including blasting them with freezing water in freezing temperatures and shooting them with rubber bullets, proved fruitless as the protesters refused to let their resolve waver.The reports of the victory over DAPL construction first began trickling in over Twitter via NBC News correspondents.Breaking: Army Corps of Engineers has told Standing Rock Sioux Chairman that the current route for the pipeline will be denied #nadpl Ayman Mohyeldin (@AymanM) December 4, 2016BREAKING: NBC News reports Army Corps denies DakotaAccessPipeline Permit near #StandingRock Sioux, camp cheers over #noDAPL Brian Thompson (@brian4NY) December 4, 2016The camp is celebrating their victory, as well they should.
