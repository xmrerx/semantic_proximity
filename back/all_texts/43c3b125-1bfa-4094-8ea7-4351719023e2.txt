Ted Nugent isn t having it!
He s being compared to Kathy Griffin by the left and he s had enough of it!We will never forget the night before the election at the very last rally for candidate Trump TED NUGENT WAS THERE AND PLAYED HIS HEART OUT!Conservative rocker Ted Nugent, who once told a concert crowd that Barack Obama should suck on [his] machine gun, says its unfair to compare him to embattled comedian Kathy Griffin.
There s no comparison whatsoever, Mr. Nugent said during a radio interview Wednesday on The Ben Ferguson Show, The Washington Examiner reported.
We re talking apples and grenades here, he said.
What Kathy Griffin did was downright vulgar, obscene, and a genuine variation of a death threat.
I ve never threatened anybody.
Ms. Griffin is facing a wave of backlash for doing a graphic photo shoot holding a realistic mock severed head of President Trump.
She has since apologized for the photos and had them removed, but lost her long-running New Year s Eve gig at CNN as a result.
Despite his history of off-color comments, Mr. Nugent was invited to the White House in April for a dinner with Mr. Trump.
Liberals in the media immediately compared Ms. Griffin s controversial stunt to Mr. Nugent s past comments, claiming there is a double standard.Mr.
Nugent, who serves on the NRA s Board of Directors, reportedly told a concert crowd in 2007: Obama, he s a piece of s .
I told him to suck on my machine gun.
Speaking in 2012 at an NRA convention in St. Louis, he said, We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November.
And in January of last year, he called for both Mr. Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be tried for treason & hung.
