According to the New York Post:President Obama is very particular about his shower head.
One thing that we were very aware of is the new president wanted a special shower head, Stephen Rochon, the White House chief usher told CNN on Sunday, recalling when the Obamas moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. And so we had to scramble to make sure we had the perfect rain shower head for President Obama.
President-elect Trump has said he won t be giving the famous address a makeover.Trump will move into the White House Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.We re so lucky to have Trump in the Oval Office to clean up the mess from the past 8 years!
He s going to slash and burn in his first 100 days in office.
Honestly, who else is counting the minutes until Trump is inaugurated?
We re ready!
