berlin ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel s christian democrats ( cdu ) and the rival social democrats ( spd ) are neck-and-neck ahead of a crucial regional election in the state of lower saxony , an infratest dimap poll showed on thursday .
the oct. 15 snap election is being followed unusually closely because it follows just three weeks after national elections and will delay federal coalition negotiations , since parties are reluctant to alienate core voters by making compromises ahead of a key regional vote .
the poll placed the cdu on 35 percent , just ahead of the spd on 34 percent .
the greens were in third place on 9 percent , followed by the pro-business free democrats on 8 percent .
the radical left party was on 5 percent and the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) party was on 6 percent .
