clearly the type of person who should be placed in a position of governmental power.from the hill : lois lerner , the central figure in the irs targeting controversy , called abraham lincoln the country s worst president in an email disclosed in a bipartisan senate report , according to usa today .
look my view is that lincoln was our worst president not our best , lerner wrote in an email dated march 6 , 2014.lerner , the former irs director of exempted organizations , joked in one email that the 16th president should have just let the south secede , rather than fighting the civil war .
he should [ have ] let the south go , lerner wrote in response to a friend who disparaged texas as a pathetic state .
we really do seem to have [ two ] different mind sets .
