london ( reuters ) - britain s upper parliamentary chamber , the house of lords , has appointed a woman to the role of black rod for the first time in the office s 650-year history .
sarah clarke , currently responsible for the organization of the annual wimbledon tennis championships , will be known as the lady usher of the black rod .
in charge of the major ceremonial events in the palace of westminster , black rod is best known for having the door to the house of commons slammed in the official s face at the state opening of parliament to symbolize the independence of the lower house .
black rod traditionally reacts to the historic insult by banging three times on the door with his symbol of office , an ebony staff topped with a golden lion .
the door is then opened and all members of parliament follow black rod back to the lords chamber to hear the queen s speech .
the earliest known reference to the role is in letters patent from 1361 which refer to one walter whitehorse performing the role .
there are thought to have been 60 holders of the position since then , while there are also black rods in the parliaments and legislative assemblies of canada , australia and new zealand .
in a statement , clarke , who will start early next year , said she was honored to be invited to take up the role .
the house of lords is a place where the smallest detail is as important as the big picture and the depth of heritage and tradition is second to none , she said .
lord fowler , speaker of the house of lords said it was a historic moment for the house .
people are most familiar with black rod for the part they play at state opening , but the job is much more than that , he said .
