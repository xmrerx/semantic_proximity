ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has blocked access into the country from northern Iraq at the Habur border gate in its southeast, but it was still possible to enter Iraq through the crossing, broadcaster NTV said on Monday.
The move came as voting started in an independence referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.
