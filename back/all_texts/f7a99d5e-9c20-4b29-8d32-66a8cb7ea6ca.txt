Joshua James, a 24-year-old resident of Jupiter, Florida, is facing charges of assault with a deadly weapon, illegal transportation of an alligator, and theft.The charges were filed after James threw a three-and-a-half foot long, living American alligator through a Wendy s drive-thru window.According to investigators at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Division, James and a friend were driving on Southern Blvd.
near Loxahatchee, in Palm Beach County, when he noticed the alligator at the side of the road.He pulled his four-door pickup truck to the side of the road and then wrangled the reptile into the backseat.After capturing the animal, James drove to a gas station, where he proceeded to fill up his gas tank, with the live alligator in the backseat.He then headed off to the Wendy s drive-thru, where he ordered a large drink.After the server handed him his beverage, he reached into the back of the truck, grabbed the alligator, and threw it through the drive-up window, into the restaurant.Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation officers were called to the scene to remove the alligator from the restaurant.Conservation officials took this picture.Image credit: screen capture from NBC 5, via youtubeOn February 9, Judge Joseph Marx released James on $6,000 bail.As part of the terms of his release, James is barred from visiting any Wendy s restaurants.
He is also barred from coming into contact with any animals, except for his mother s dog.Under Florida law, it is a third-degree felony to kill, attempt to kill, possess or capture an alligator or its eggs without a license.
James faces up to five years in prison on that charge alone.Conservation officials managed to capture the gator.
It was released into a nearby canal, where it can hopefully live out the rest of its life without further contact with idiotic humans.According to James, throwing the alligator was just a funny prank.
The people working inside the restaurant didn t find it so funny.
Thankfully, neither the employees nor the alligator were injured during this stupid stunt, although things could have ended much differently.Here s more on this story from NBC 5, via YouTube.
