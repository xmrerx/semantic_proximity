algiers ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said on wednesday he did not support u.s. president donald trump s unilateral decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and called for calm across the region .
this decision is a regrettable decision that france does not approve of and goes against international law and all the resolutions of the u.n. security council , macron told reporters at a news conference in algiers .
trump reversed decades of u.s. policy on wednesday and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and said he would move the embassy to the city , despite warnings from around the world that the gesture further drives a wedge between israel and the palestinians .
the status of jerusalem is a question of international security that concerns the entire international community .
the status of jerusalem must be determined by israelis and palestinians in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the united nations , he said .
macron , who has developed a good working relationship with trump since taking office in may , spoke to the u.s. leader earlier this week to try to convince him to change his mind .
france and europe are attached to a two-state solution - israel and palestine - leaving side by side in peace and security within recognized international borders with jerusalem the capital of both states , he said , adding that paris was ready to work with partners to find a solution .
he called for calm .
for now , i urge for calm and for everyone to be responsible .
we must avoid at all costs avoid violence and foster dialogue , he said .
