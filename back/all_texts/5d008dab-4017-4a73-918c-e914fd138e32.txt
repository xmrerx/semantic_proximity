It s time for Sean Hannity to join Bill O Reilly in the unemployment line.On Saturday, the New York Times published an article reporting that Donald Trump gets policy advise from Sean Hannity among many others outside the White House.
Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial Presidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers.
Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Indeed, Hannity served as Trump s chief propagandist during the 2016 campaign and often did interviews with Hannity in order to get the kid gloves treatment.Of course, Hannity had a complete meltdown on Twitter over the article and proceeded to accuse the New York Times of colluding with Hillary Clinton and referred to them as fake news, which is something Trump would do.
@nytimes You colluded with HRC in 2016.
It s none of your business who i do or do not talk too.
Total fake news speculation about me/@POTUS Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017Hannity even accused the Times of spying on his private conversations.
@nytimes Any conversation I have with ANYONE is supposed to be PRIVATE.
I have NEVER talked to you.
Was I surveilled and unmasked by u/NSA?
Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017That s when several New York Times writers jumped in to defend their publication.Maggie Haberman fired back by informing Hannity that sourced cited him as a person Trump talks to for advise and further informed Hannity that Fox News did not object to the story when the New York Times reached out to the network.W all due respect, we were interested in who POTUS talks to, not you, and several ppl close to him cited you https://t.co/sb9y4nDJYt Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 22, 2017Also reached out to Fox News pr, who took no issue w it.
And it was hardly critical of you.
Not sure why the reax https://t.co/sb9y4nDJYt Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 22, 2017Hannity then claimed that he doesn t talk to the New York Times and said that he doubts Trump does either.The @nytimes has no clue who I talk to as I refuse to EVER TALK TO THEM!
@POTUS knows you are FAKE NEWS and I doubt he talks to u either.
Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017But he s wrong.
It turns out Trump has done two in-depth interviews with the New York Times in the last month.Then Glenn Thrush chimed in.I was once sitting with a Republican elected official preparing for an interview when he got an email from u giving him political advice https://t.co/lhn4UFQn7I Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) April 22, 2017Apparently, Hannity forgot about that.
He also forgot that he has, indeed, spoken with the New York Times and Nick Corasaniti was kind enough to provide a link to the interview.Here s an interview I did with Sean last year: https://t.co/uUMU1yGcoe https://t.co/QzNFgNxSMi Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) April 22, 2017Yeah, that has to be embarrassing.Anyway, the night passed and Hannity was apparently still pissed off so he imploded on Sunday morning in a series of tweets directed at the trio of writers.Maggie have you ever publicly commented on how @wikileaks revealed the @nytimes colluded with HRC?
And then hired @GlennThrush also exposed https://t.co/xPLZpLLzy6 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Maggie, why should people ever accept several people close to him as a source, especially when you never contacted me.
Did you ask @POTUS https://t.co/xPLZpLLzy6 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017 Several people close to him Everyone knows people at every WH and every corp. have agendas and leak.
Maybe a new standard.
On the record https://t.co/xPLZpLLzy6 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Not critical of me, but @nytimes has a Biased Anti Trump agenda, and by suggesting @POTUS takes advice from me, is meant to diminish him!
https://t.co/vxoNrCkZuX Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017During the campaign I can CONFIRM I and & others suggested he stop tweeting.
He never did.
He is his own man.
In retrospect I now agree.
https://t.co/vxoNrCkZuX Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Yes Nick, I did talk you.
Frankly one of the few times the @nytimes was fair to me At some point I decided the @nytimes is Fake News-gave up https://t.co/YiD2nB3OPB Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Maggie that s called Humor .
I don t believe the @nytimes surveilled me.
But I am happy people at the @nytimes believe in the Lord!
Amen!
https://t.co/OcrvOXvsVz Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Yes KRM is brilliant and successful, but he also runs FNC (hated by @nytimes )and according to @nytimes yesterday he is old school on Issues https://t.co/nGFns5H6ai Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017So anonymous sources should be taken with a grain of salt.
People might manipulate say the @nytimes by offering such quotes?
We agree!!
https://t.co/hghQjfATGk Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017The highlight of your career!!
Best Sean https://t.co/jWMcY9ffEj Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Seriously, Fox News should ditch Sean Hannity as well.
He has far too many embarrassing meltdowns in public.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images
