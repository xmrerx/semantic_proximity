Bernie Sanders visited the United States-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona to witness one area that will be most affected by U.S. immigration policy.
Sanders then spoke to a large crowd about his time listening to the stories of immigrants and the need to create a reality-based immigration policy that puts compassion first.
As I have traveled around this country and talked to immigrant families, and particularly Latino immigrant families, I am struck by the fear and sadness that grips so many of them, Sanders said following the visit.
Fathers or mothers or both sent out of the country having to leave their minor children with relatives or guardians here in the United States.
A U.S. service member whose spouse was deported.
A 12-year-old boy who longs to be reunited with his mother.
This human suffering has got to end.
That is why I am here today.
During the event, Sanders delivered blistering remarks aimed towards Donald Trump and the Republican presidential candidate s incredulous plan to build a giant border wall.
The most bizarre part of Trump s plan is to have the construction of this wall be paid for by the Mexican government.
Sanders calls out Trump s bigoted remarks against Mexicans, including the time Trump implied that immigrants from Mexico are rapists.
I would hope that all of us are rightly appalled by the divisive bigoted and xenophobic comments of people like Donald Trump.
Trump s labeling of Mexicans as rapists and criminals repulses all Americans of good will.
Mexico is our neighbor, which we have extremely important relations with.
To insult an entire nation is not befitting of anybody, let alone a candidate for president of the United States.
Citing Pope Francis, Sanders said that Pope Francis has said we should be building more bridges, not more walls.
Pope Francis is right.
