For the first time, we have a woman of color featured on coins here.
She portrays Lady Liberty on a $100 225th Anniversary Gold Coin, which commemorates the founding of the U.S. Mint.
It s a reflection of the cultural and ethnic diversity of the United States, and honestly, it s about damn time.
She is absolutely gorgeous on the new coin:Treasury & Mint officials unveiled the 2017 American Liberty High Relief Gold Coin!

@NBCNews @NBCBLK .Great more social justice revisionist history and institution shaming.

Good times.
Admiral Theranthrope (@Theranthrope) January 13, 2017Lady Liberty is based on Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom.
The Statue of Liberty, modeled after the French sculptor s mother, is likewise based on her, as are most of our depictions of Lady Liberty.
To conservatives, this means that she must remain white, because obviously.Except Lady Liberty is an idea, not an actual person.
This isn t the same as depicting George Washington as a black man on the $1 bill.
Washington was a real person who was white.
The American ideal of liberty encompasses and represents the diversity of America.
Lady Liberty is a symbol.This coin is the first of a series from the U.S. Mint, which will include an Asian woman, a Native American woman, and a Hispanic woman, as Lady Liberty as well.
Cue more crocodile tears from whiny, racist conservatives.Featured image via embedded tweet from United States Mint
