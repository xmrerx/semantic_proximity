geneva ( reuters ) - the humanitarian situation in the besieged eastern suburbs of damascus is an outrage and parties to the conflict must allow food and medicine to reach at least 350,000 trapped syrians , u.n. human rights chief zeid ra ad al-hussein said on friday .
the shocking images of what appear to be severely malnourished children that have emerged in recent days are a frightening indication of the plight of people in eastern ghouta , who are now facing a humanitarian emergency , zeid said in a statement .
the tightening siege has pushed people to the verge of famine in the rebel enclave , residents and aid workers have told reuters .
i remind all parties that the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law , and may amount to a crime against humanity and/or a war crime , zeid said .
zeid s office had a list of several hundred people who needed medical evacuation , but the government had reportedly imposed severe restrictions on such evacuations , leading to the deaths of several civilians , the u.n. statement said .
a u.n. convoy last reached the besieged area on sept 23 , with aid for 25,000 people .
food prices have rocketed since forces loyal to president bashar al-assad took control of several neighborhoods in may and destroyed tunnels that had been used to smuggle goods into the siege .
this month they closed eastern ghouta s main access checkpoint and imposed a big rise in taxes imposed on traders .
last week two food warehouses were looted in a possible sign of growing desperation , the u.n. statement said .
