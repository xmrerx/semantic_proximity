abidjan ( reuters ) - close to 100 prisoners escaped from prison in central ivory coast on sunday in one of many security breaches in the west african economic powerhouse this year , state radio said .
ninety-six prisoners escaped from the katiola facility at dawn while the gate was open temporarily to allow them to do chores in the vicinity , the radio station said .
about 10 have since been recaptured .
the jail break follows a similar escape this month in the commercial capital abidjan when 20 people fled after assaulting police officers in a court house .
in other incidents , weapons were stolen and in one case an officer was killed .
it was not immediately clear if there had been any violence at katiola , located about 400 km inland from the atlantic coast .
government officials were not immediately available for comment .
a series of military mutinies this year has threatened to derail a fragile peace in ivory coast , the world s leading cocoa producer , which emerged from a decade of turmoil and a 2011 civil war as one of the world s fastest-growing economies .
