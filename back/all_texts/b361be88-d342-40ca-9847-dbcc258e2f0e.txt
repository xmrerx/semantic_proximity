MOSCOW (Reuters) - The anti-missile shield being built by Washington on foreign soil is a key problem for Russia and China, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday.
Addressing an international non-proliferation conference in Moscow, Lavrov also said the U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in Europe should be returned to U.S. territory.
