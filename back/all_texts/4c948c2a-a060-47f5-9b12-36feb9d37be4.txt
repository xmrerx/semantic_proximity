The GOP implosion continues, and this time Meg Whitman, failed California gubernatorial candidate, is adding the fuel to the fire.Meeting with Republican leaders at a retreat in Utah, set up by Mitt Romney, Whitman called out House Speaker Paul Ryan over his endorsement of Donald Trump, going as far as to compare the candidate s rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.According to sources who spoke with Politico:At one point, according to two sources, during a question and answer session, Whitman, the billionaire chief executive officer of Hewlett Packard, challenged Ryan over his decision to support Trump.
In framing the question, according to the sources, she compared Trump to past historical demagogues including Hitler and Mussolini.In responding to the question, Ryan pointed out that he s criticized Trump in the past.
But, as the House Republican leader, he stressed that he had a complex job and had to lead an entire conference.So, in other words, Ryan has no principles and has to act as a sheep for the rest of the tea partiers that have invaded the House of Representatives.
It s good to see one Republican expose this truth.
Meanwhile, progressives have been saying this for a month now.At the same retreat, Romney told reporters that Trump would usher in trickle-down racism should he be elected, echoing Whitman s criticisms that his rhetoric has become over the top.For anyone who might remember, Whitman ran unsuccessfully for governor of California against incumbent Jerry Brown, spending over $140 million of her own money (the most personal money any candidate has used in American history), and lost by 13 percent.
In that same election, Carly Fiorina, who would go on to challenge Trump for the GOP presidential nominee, ran and lost to Senator Barbara Boxer.So far, not one Republican has compared Trump to someone like Hitler until now.
And these comments were made in a closed door meeting with high power Republicans.
Only God knows what they really say behind closed doors about their precious nominee.Leave it to Meg Whitman to say what the rest of us are thinking, and leave it to Paul Ryan to brush it off and continue being a sheep.Hey, Republicans, how s that unity coming along?Featured image via Andrew Burton
