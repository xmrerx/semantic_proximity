geneva ( reuters ) - the new president of the world s largest humanitarian network , the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ( ifrc ) , promised on tuesday to crack down on corruption after a scandal over ebola funds in west africa .
francesco rocca , who headed the italian red cross and oversaw its role in the mediterranean refugee crisis , was elected on monday to lead the ifrc .
he said the organization should have zero tolerance for any grey area or black hole and its 190 national societies should adopt very strict policies .
what has happened could jeopardize our credibility , rocca told reuters .
last month the ifrc said it had uncovered fraud committed during its operations to combat the deadly ebola virus outbreak in guinea , liberia and sierra leone in 2014-2016 .
the estimated losses totaled 6 million swiss francs , including suspected collusion between ifrc staff and bank employees in sierra leone , fake billing in guinea and inflated prices and payments in liberia .
it s a huge offense to our volunteers , who spend their lives and sacrifice their time ( away from ) their family , their friends , their free time , sometimes their job , to spend for humanity , rocca said .
then someone is creating profit on their shoulders .
it is something that is really unacceptable .
rocca said other priorities for the organization included recruiting more volunteers to help cope with bigger and more frequent natural disasters , and persuading politicians to take the right decisions .
politicians were too concerned about the present and needed to think longer-term to solve big problems , rocca said .
one such issue was the flow of migrants and refugees from africa to europe , thousands of whom die every year as they try to cross the sahara and the mediterranean .
if after 30 years people are still escaping for the same reason , perhaps we need to rethink how we have worked so far in that area of the world , he said .
