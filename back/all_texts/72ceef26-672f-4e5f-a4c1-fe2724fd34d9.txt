As time goes on, it becomes ever clearer that Trump is Russia s puppet.
There s every possibility he owes them money, and he s repeatedly blasted our intelligence community for daring to say that Russia did, indeed, engage in a concerted campaign to influence our election in Trump s favor.
But did he always feel this way?
Was he always Russia s puppet?It seems not, and it s by his own words that we know this.
As recently as 2014, he said, in a series of interviews, that Mitt Romney was right to say that Russia was our greatest geopolitical foe: [Mitt] said [Russia is] a hell of a problem, and everybody laughed at him, including certain media, by the way.
They laughed.
It turned out that he s absolutely right.
You look at what Russia s doing with Iran, how they controlled the situation, and Syria, and virtually every other place.
He also insinuated that Obama was Putin s puppet because he felt we being meek and cowardly in the face of such a threat.
We should definitely be strong, we should definitely do sanctions, and we have to show some strength.
I mean, Putin has eaten Obama s lunch, therefore our lunch, for a long period of time.
Now he says he s open to lifting our sanctions on Russia if we can all just get along, which is never going to happen because Russia is ruled by an autocrat.
If we lift the sanctions, Russia will pull Trump s puppet strings even more.
He also seems to like to kiss Putin s ass, mouth, and dick he doesn t criticize Russia at all, and staunchly defends them against other criticisms and revelations.Here s his stance back in 2014:In other words, this is another position on which he s flip-flopped.
He just says whatever his strongest manhandlers want him to say.
Whether they re his supporters, or foreign powers hoping to use him for their own gain, he says whatever he thinks will win him the most points.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images
