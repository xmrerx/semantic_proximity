Don t bite the hands that feed you people !Posted by Saad Kooza Salman on Saturday, June 6, 2015 You cannot handle their freedom, thats why you re full of hate Where do you think those 2 -3 million soldiers who fought your f ass s in Fallujah and Ramadi and Baghdad and up-north went?
They are here they did not forget how to kill, they did not forget how to fight.
The same ones who fought you in Fallujah, they will f - you up here too.
They got guns, but they don t want to choose that path.
Don t call it your country if you don t fight for it, you coward!
And you, as Americans, sympathizing with those mother f s , trying to off police officers and killing American people here!
Shame on you!
Stand up!
Grow some balls!
I m not an advocate for war, but the time has come to let them know.
We will die for this nation, we will fight for this country.
Whites, blacks, Chinese, I don t care what color you are!
You are Muslims living here and benefiting from this country!
Stand up for this America!
I don t see no religion, I don t see no color.
I see you are an American with us or you are against us!
That s my message to you!
Deal with that!
I m an American by choice my friend, I love this flag and I will stand by it and I will die for it.
That s my message to you.
