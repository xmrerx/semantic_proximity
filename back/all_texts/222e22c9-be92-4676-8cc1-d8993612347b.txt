Trump transition team member Devin Nunes, who inexplicably is leading the congressional investigation into Trump s ties with Russia, recently got himself in a spot of trouble when he met with a source he will not reveal on the White House grounds in the middle of the night on Wednesday to obtain sketchy intel that seems intended to back Trump s claim that President Obama tapped his wires.
Nunes claims that he was shown U.S. surveillance documents that indicate numerous members of the Trump team were indirectly surveilled when they contacted some shady foreign people who were being investigated.
Instead of taking this information, which may or may not be true as the alleged Trump investigator refuses to show his work, to his fellow investigators Nunes admits he ran straight to the main subject of the investigation.By Thursday, Nunes was scrambling to apologize for corrupting the investigation by leaking details to the guy he s supposed to be investigating amid calls for him to recuse himself.
But Nunes refuses to do so despite a clear conflict of interest.On Wednesday, CNN caught up to Nunes to ask if he will recuse himself and he decided the appropriate response was that of a third-grader:This is the mentality of the people with whom we are dealing they are like children who have been handed too much power and are f*cking evil.
But really, what did we expect given that Nunes boss regularly employs the I know you are but what am I?
and But teacher, he hit me too defenses.Watch it below:Instead of recusing himself from the #TrumpRussia investigation, @DevinNunes insults and denies just like @realDonaldTrump.
