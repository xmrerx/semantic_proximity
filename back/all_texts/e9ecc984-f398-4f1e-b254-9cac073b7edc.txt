Trump continued to claim credit for things with which he had little to do when February s jobs report came out earlier today, and Sean Spicer even defended him to a press that wanted to know why jobs reports are suddenly authentic, when they were all fake under Obama.
But the hypocrisy doesn t end there, apparently.
Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, issued his own statement on the jobs report, and in doing so, he brought Republican hypocrisy to a whole new level.The February 2016 jobs report, which, of course, came out under Obama, showed 242,000 new jobs.
Brady said: While it s good news that more Americans have joined the labor force, it s disappointing to see so little growth in full time work and wages.
One year later, we have a jobs report that says 238,000 new jobs were created in February.
Brady said: This is a great report.
The fact that hundreds of thousands more people found new jobs last month is a good sign that our economy is moving in the right direction.
Isn t 238,000 less than 242,000?
Or is there some kind of new math of which we aren t yet aware?
Really, partisan games and fuzzy math are the only explanation for Brady s saying he s very pleased about last month s jobs report it s obviously because there s a Republican in the White House and Brady wants to kiss his ass.It also showcases Republicans insistence on opposing everything that Obama ever did.Brady should have thought this out a little better.
There s no way to spin the difference between the two statements as anything other than sheer GOP hypocrisy.Take a look at both full statements below:Kevin Brady on the February 2016 job report v. Kevin Brady on February 2017 job report.
What could have changed?
