london ( reuters ) - manfred weber , a leading lawmaker in the european parliament , said on wednesday he was more confident about britain and the european union ironing out difficulties in the brexit talks .
weber , an ally of german chancellor angela merkel in the parliament , spoke after meeting theresa may in london but would not say whether the british prime minister had signalled she was ready to move on a financial settlement with the eu .
negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union have stalled over the divorce bill , with eu officials increasingly frustrated that britain has not detailed its approach to settling what it owes the bloc when it leaves in march 2019 .
after my meetings here in london my main message is i am more optimistic , there is progress ... that is the most important thing because the perspective from a european point of view towards london was in the last weeks not so clear , weber told a news conference .
asked whether there was any movement on the financial settlement , he declined to comment on what he described as private discussions with may .
a spokesman for may said in a statement that she and weber had discussed an implementation period to smooth britain s departure from the bloc , and that weber had asked what this would look like in practice .
the secretary of state for exiting the eu ( brexit minister david davis , who was also present ) outlined the need to avoid a cliff-edge ( exit ) - including for the stability of the financial sector across europe , the spokesman said .
