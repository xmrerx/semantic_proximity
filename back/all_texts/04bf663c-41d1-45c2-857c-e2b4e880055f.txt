George Soros funded, Obama approved domestic terrorism.
It s all the rage with the progressive left Black Lives Matter activists tried to disrupt the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday and marched down the street, shouting a chant that called for the deaths of police officers: Pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!
The phrase pigs in a blanket refers to police officers in body bags and has been used overtly by a Black Lives Matter-influenced activist who murdered two police officers.Video shows that, as the group happily chanted about murdering police officers, they had a police escort protecting their safety and First Amendment rights.

As the Daily Mail reported at the time, the chant was used by Ferguson protestors following the excecution of two police officers by a killer who used the exact phrase pigs in a blanket :Shocking video taken at a protest in St. Louis shows several demonstrators taunting police just hours after two NYPD officers were killed in an apparent retribution killing following the Michael Brown and Eric Garner grand jury decisions.Bassem Masri has made headlines before for his protest tactics and Saturday he appeared to stay true to form in a video in which he chants at police, Pigs in a blanket smell like bacon.
Hours before, Ismaaiyl Brinsley shot and killed NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos after posting he d soon be putting pigs in a blanket.
