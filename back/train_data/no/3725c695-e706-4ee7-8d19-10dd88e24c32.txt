evelyn farkas : .. dark campaign of fake news you know that s still ongoing .
we see um even someone like myself get swept up in all of this you know when people like me are speaking on behalf of process , people spin it to uh suit their needs and i think maybe the russians may be behind such fake news today .
there s a total distortion about what i said i was outside of government .
i had no access to intelligence on this whatsoever , but i was concerned because i knew how the russians operate and i was reading these reports about them hacking into the elections then giving the information to wikipedia .
evelyn farkas now blames russia for saying what she said & for giving surveilance intel to wikipedia !
