The Walt Disney Company the same group that s so woke, they once apologized for drawing a fat cartoon that made race-baiters mad has taken it upon themselves to teach your kids about LGBT rights by featuring their first on-screen gay character.According to this, Disney plans to have one of the main characters on their popular tween show Andi Mack come out as gay in this week s episode.
Oh and it s a 13-year-old boy who s got feelings for the main character s crush.Of course, the character s coming out as gay doesn t to do with moving the plotline forward so much as it pushes the pro-LBGT agenda the media are determined to cram down your throat or, if that fails, your kid s. Andi Mack is a story about tweens figuring out who they are, said Disney Channel in a statement.
(Creator) Terri Minsky, the cast and everyone involved in the show takes great care in ensuring that it s appropriate for all audiences and sends a powerful message about inclusion and respect for humanity.
Producers say the coming out scene will have the barely-a-teenager telling a friend about his feelings for a boy at school.
His friend will tell him it s A-O.K.
and perfectly natural for guys to like guys, because Disney s all about creating a brainwashing supportive atmosphere.
The company added they consulted with several outside advocacy groups to make sure the scene was age-appropriate and sufficiently inclusive, including gay activist groups GLAAD and PFLAG, along with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and Common Sense Media.Groups that would ve likely had a different opinion about teaching pre-pubescent elementary school kids the importance of being gay didn t make the list.According to ratings data, the median age of Andi Mack s viewers is 10.
In fact, the show is the Disney channel s No.
1-rated program among kids six-14.
Because nothing says inclusivity like teaching six-year-olds about being gay, whether their parents like it or not.
