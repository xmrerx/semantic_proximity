NJ Governor Chris Christie was being heckled during a baseball game at Miller Park.
He lost it and got in the face of a Chicago Cubs fan and said Yeah, you re a big shot .

The Cubs fan was asked by one of the people around him what did Christie say and the fan replied: You want to act like a big shot?
Christie s son works for the Brewers.
Christie was recently booed at a New York Mets game after catching a foul ball in the stands.
He has also filled in for New York City sports radio host Mike Francesa in what may have been an audition to possibly succeed Francesa, when he retires at the end of the year.THIS ISN T CHRISTIE S FIRST RUN-IN WITH A MAN ON THE STREET:Via: Gateway Pundit
