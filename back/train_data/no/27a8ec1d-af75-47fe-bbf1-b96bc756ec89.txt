paris ( reuters ) - a court on friday sentenced a radicalized french woman to 10 years in prison after traveling to syria where her son was fighting alongside islamic state militants .
christine riviere , 51 , dubbed by investigators as jihadi gran , was arrested in 2014 after three trips to syria , which she said were aimed at spending time with her son in case he was killed .
announcing the decision , the judge said riviere had demonstrated a firm commitment to islamic state and had contributed to strengthening the group logistically .
france , like other european nations , is wrestling with how to deal with those returning from the syrian conflict .
a presidency official said last week that half of the 500 children were born there , and in total about 2,000 french nationals or residents had gone to the two countries , instead of trying to disengage your son , it seems on the contrary that you encouraged him , the judge said .
investigators believe that riviere s son , tyler vilus , climbed the islamic state hierarchy to lead a francophile group .
arrested in july 2015 in turkey and now imprisoned in france , vilus is suspected of having known members of the network that planned and carried out the november 2015 attacks in paris in which 130 people were killed .
the sentencing comes a week after a mother-of-three was found guilty of financing terrorism after she sent money abroad to her radicalized son who later traveled to fight in syria .
she was sentenced to two years in jail .
