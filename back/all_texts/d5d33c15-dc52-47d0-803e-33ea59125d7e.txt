The numbers are in, and over 3 million men and women of all backgrounds took to the streets all across the nation to protest Donald Trump and his incoming disastrous presidency.In 670 cities throughout the north, south, east and west in some of the most conservative enclaves like Lubbock, Texas protestors partook in peaceful demonstrations, and their decorum shined bright.Not one person was arrested, and not incident of violence surfaced.In Washington D.C, over 500,000 men and women gathered on the National Mall, and not one violent act sullied the day, and no arrests made for any reason.In Los Angeles, 750,000 convened (even though police only prepared for 80,000), and like Washington, not one arrest was made and not one incident of violence occurred.In New York City, 400,000 people convened, and not one was arrested.Not only were the demonstrations peaceful and orderly, police officers were deeply involved with the community, expressing solidarity with men and women:DC cops posted across from White House are wearing pink pussyhats and posing for photos with marchers.
Big cheers from crowd.

How amazing it is to see women, people of color, police and partisans alike come together for one common mission.
With the next four years hanging over our heads, more instances like this will be crucial to taking back power in Washington and the state legislatures.To think that a demonstration organized by POC yielded the most peaceful of marches really puts a dent in the media (and the Trump Administration s) perception of minorities and those who protest.To paraphrase one attendee, it was a sea of humanism.The Women s March was, arguably, the largest and most peaceful demonstration in American history.
The women of America (once again) showed their strength, and they should be so proud.While punches were thrown at Trump s rallies, hugs and high fives were given at the Women s March.
