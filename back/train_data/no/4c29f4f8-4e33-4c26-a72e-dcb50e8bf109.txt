tokyo ( reuters ) - japanese prime minister shinzo abe on monday said his decision to call a snap election would not distract his government from responding to north korean threats , pledging to increase pressure if pyongyang failed to halt its missile and nuclear weapons development .
north korea has launched two ballistic missiles and tested what was likely a hydrogen bomb in the past several weeks raising tension in east asia .
abe spoke at a press conference to announce his plan to dissolve parliament on thursday and call a snap election .
