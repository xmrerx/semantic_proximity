UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia s U.N.
Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Monday military solutions cannot settle the Korean Peninsula issues and warned there was an urgent need to maintain a cool head and refrain from any action that can escalate tensions.
A comprehensive settlement to the nuclear and other issues plaguing the Korean peninsula can be arrived at solely through political diplomatic channels, including by leveraging the mediation efforts of the United Nations secretary-general, Nebenzia told the U.N. Security Council.
