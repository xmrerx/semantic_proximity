Full Frontal host Samantha Bee is NOT one to mince words.
She took the GOP to the woodshed in the latest episode of her show because of their refusal to even consider President Obama s nominee to replace deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.
The worst part of it is that it is a blatant ploy to keep the highest court in the land tipped in favor of conservatives, because, by all definitions, the nominee, Merrick Garland, isn t even a liberal.
He s a centrist.
Granted, he d rule with common sense and he isn t a flaming bigot, so, by GOP standards, that makes him further left than Bernie Sanders.Bee railed them, saying: Why are you c*ckblocking this gentle law Hobbit?
She then went on to take half-melted Reagan dummy from Madame Tussaud s wax museum Ted Cruz, as well as other GOPers to task for referring to President Obama as a lame duck.
Bee said: Jesus Christ, he s not a lame duck.
He s three trimesters away from lame duckery.
A president s term is four years; you can t say three of them are legitimate and the fourth is garbage.
They re not Indiana Jones movies.
Finally, the hilarious host pointed out the huge gamble here: they can either go with Garland, or they can wait for Hillary Clinton to nominate a transgender Black Panther abortion doctor or for Donald Trump to go with a pile of Maxim magazines.
Either way, they lose BIG.Bee is beyond right here, of course.
This is just the GOP playing politics, trying to take President Obama s right and duty to do his job in his last year in office away.
