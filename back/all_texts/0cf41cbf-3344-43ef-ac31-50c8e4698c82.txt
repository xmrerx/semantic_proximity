Is Van Jones on Trump s payroll yet or is he just tired of being on the party of losers?
Van Jones appeared on CNN s Anderson Cooper show last night and mocked the ridiculous attempt by rabid leftist MSNBC host Rachel Maddow to embarrass President Trump as part of her jihad on the President.After laughing about all the hype, Jones told the panel: If all we get tonight is that Trump paid $38M to America s government, that s a good night for Trump.
I m sorry.
I was hoping and praying that it would show not only did he not pay no taxes, he actually charged the government that he actually got something back..@VanJones68: If all we get tonight is that Trump paid $38M to America s government, that s a good night for Trump https://t.co/kvYlq8udPf Anderson Cooper 360 (@AC360) March 15, 2017If you have the stomach for it, we included the full clip of MSNBC s Rachel Maddow s lame attempt at jihad on President Trump:
