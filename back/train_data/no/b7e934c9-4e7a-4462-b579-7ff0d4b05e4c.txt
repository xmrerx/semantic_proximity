just think how many youth centers could have been built in inner cities or how many broken-down classrooms in america could have been repaired with the $ 3.5 million being wasted on jill stein and hillary s futile recount effort ?
aren t the democrats all about the poor , the downtrodden and the disenfranchised ?
or are they really just all about staying in power ?
the next time one of your progressive friends tries to argue with you about how the democrats are all about compassion , remind them of the money that was wasted on this recount that could ve been used to help the very people they proclaim to be helping.shameful day 5 of the wisconsin recount continued the pattern on previous days , as donald trump extended his election day lead over hillary clinton by a couple dozen votes.trump leads wisconsin by about 22,000 votes .
so far , data from the wisconsin recount as of december 5 shows that little is changing .
the major candidates have each gained a smattering of votes in municipalities around the state as a variety of errors are found , but nothing has changed in significant enough numbers to upend the election .
not even close .
trump and clinton have also each lost votes in communities throughout the state , basically making any gains and losses a wash.here are the specific totals : trump has lost 302 votes .
trump has gained 386 votes .

clinton has gained 351 votes .
