This is how Brussels deals with right-wing extremists.The March Against Fear in Brussels, Belgium kicked off on Sunday despite threats from right-wingers and a suggestion on Saturday that it be postponed due to security concerns.The march was planned in the aftermath of terrorist attacks by ISIS that left over 30 dead and hundreds injured as a way to fight back against right-wing efforts to demonize all Muslims and as a way to to stand up to terrorists and say that their attacks will not disrupt our society.But as thousands gathered in Place de la Bourse to pay tribute to those who lost their lives, right-wing protesters arrived in an effort to derail the march.The hateful protesters harassed Muslims with Nazi salutes and offensive language until the police had finally had enough.At that point, they turned water cannons on the right-wingers and chased them up the street as the marchers cheered.Here s the video via Twitter.JUST IN: Police fire water cannon after tensions rose between protesters near #Brussels square.

They demanded Obama drop everything to return home in a panic and lock himself in the Situation Room of the White House or travel to Belgium, either of which would have only made the situation worse Instead, President Obama remained calm and offered his condolences and support to Belgium s Prime Minister and continued his trip.
As right-wingers in the United States panicked and let ISIS control them with fear, Obama refused to let the terrorists win.Perhaps we should think about using water cannons on right-wingers.
Maybe that will cool them off next time they try to use a terrorist attack to spread hate and fear.
