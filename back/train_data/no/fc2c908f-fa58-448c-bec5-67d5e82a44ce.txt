obama s narcacism was in full swing on saturday night at the 46th annual legislative conference phoenix awards dinner of the congressional black caucus .
he spoke for almost a half an hour about how good he has been for the country , and then he manages to tell the room that they need to vote for hillary to keep from insulting his legacy !
oh , how the mighty have fallen .
my name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot .
tolerance is on the ballot .
democracy is on the ballot .
justice is on the ballot .
good schools are on the ballot .
ending mass incarceration , that s on the ballot right now .
and there is one candidate who will advance those things .
and there is another candidate whose defining principle , the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done .
there s no such thing as a vote that doesn t matter .
it all matters , and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012 , especially in the african-american community , i will consider it a personal insult , an insult to my legacy , if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election .
you want to give me a good sendoff ?
go vote !
