A Democratic Senator tried to compare Trump nominee Kathleen Hartnett White to a horse during testimony before members of the Environment and Public Works Committee .Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse tried to relate a story of Caligula s horse to the nominee but it went over like a lead balloon.
We could start off by saying as a rule of thumb that a woman should never be compared to a horse Not a good idea.
This arrogant and insensitive Senator thought he would get away with demeaning Ms. White .Watch what happens when Senator Barrasso gets his two cents worth in The committee voted to confirm White s nomination to lead the White House s Council on Environmental Quality, Wednesday.Washington Free Beacon reports:During a business meeting prior to the party-line vote, Whitehouse likened White to the ancient Roman emperor Caligula s horse: There is a popular legend of the Emperor Caligula appointing his horse to the Roman Senate, Whitehouse said.
Had he done that, it would have raised important questions, but the real questions would not have been about the horse.
The horse was just a horse.
The real questions would have been about the power of the Emperor Caligula and the spine of the Roman Senate.
Discussing the merits of the horse would be pointless.
Approving this nominee for CEQ would be so preposterous that it would be like appointing Caligula s horse, in that the real question becomes about the power of our fossil fuel emperors and the spine of the Senate, he said.
This is a moment in which the Senate takes its own measure.
I guess we re about to see the answer.
Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.)
quickly condemned Whitehouse s remarks: Let me just say that comparing Ms. White to a horse, as one of our Democrat colleagues just did, to me is a new low, Barrasso said.
It s disturbing, it s demeaning, and it s dehumanizing.
