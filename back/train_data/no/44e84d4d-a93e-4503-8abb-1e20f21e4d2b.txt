washington ( reuters ) - any u.s. response to north korea s latest nuclear weapons test is unlikely to include new sanctions legislation from the u.s. congress , at least in the short term , an influential lawmaker said on tuesday .
senator bob corker , the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , said the tensions with pyongyang were so heightened that he thought it would be more appropriate for lawmakers to wait .
i don t think rushing out right now legislatively is probably the place we need to be , corker told reporters at the u.s. capitol .
as part of an agreement on a broad sanctions bill that passed in july , members of congress had agreed to consider additional , more stringent , sanctions on north korea after returning to washington after their august recess .
for example , some lawmakers have been pushing for legislation to impose secondary sanctions targeting banks that do business with north korea .
a top north korean diplomat warned on tuesday that his country was ready to send more gift packages to the united states as world powers struggled for a response to sunday s weapons test , the latest in a series .
senior officials from president donald trump s administrations , including secretary of state rex tillerson and secretary of defense jim mattis , are due to hold classified briefings on wednesday for the house of representatives and senate to discuss north korea and afghanistan .
