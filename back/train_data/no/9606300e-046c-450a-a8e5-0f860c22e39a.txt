beijing ( reuters ) - china is testing a new dredger ship that will greatly enhance its land reclamation capabilities , a state media report said on sunday , as the country continues to develop facilities in the south china sea in a bid to strengthen its claims in the waters .
state-run beijing news newspaper said the tian kun began water tests on friday .
a cutter suction dredger is a type of a ship used for large-scale projects to create or reclaim land .
for example , there are many hard coral reefs on the sea floor of the south china sea , the paper quoted zhang xiaofeng , chief engineer for the vessel , as saying , adding the ship will be put into service sometime in the first half of 2018 .
recent satellite images show that china has quietly undertaken more construction and reclamation in the south china sea , through which about $ 5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year , in a bid to strengthen its grip despite objections from brunei , malaysia , the philippines , taiwan and vietnam as well as the united states .
some experts say china will land its first deployments of jet fighters onto its runways in the spratly islands in coming months .
the united states is concerned china s construction of islands and military buildup in the waters could be used to restrict free nautical movement .
its ships have carried out freedom of navigation patrols in the area , angering china .
the subject could come up when trump visits beijing next week as part of his 12-day asia trip and meets with chinese president xi jinping , though north korea s recent nuclear and missile tests are expected to feature more prominently in talks .
the south china sea issue isn t an issue between china and the united states , china vice foreign minister zheng zeguang told reporters on friday , adding there is no issue with freedom of navigation in the region and that china has indisputable sovereignty over islands and surrounding waters .
