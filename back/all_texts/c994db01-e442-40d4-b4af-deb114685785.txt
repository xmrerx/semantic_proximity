The speech he gave to a sold out crowd on Saturday is epic.
We often listen to it to get fired up about bringing down the commies currently trying to destroy America.
It s truly epic!
THE SPEECH THAT BREITBART IS BEST KNOWN FOR IS HIS CPAC SPEECH:The complaint, filed Friday in federal court in California, says that Leopold filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI for all records related to Andrew Breitbart on Aug. 7, 2012, a few months after Breitbart died at age 43.According to the suit, the FBI responded to the request on Sept. 4, but said that the bureau only searched it main file records, claiming that no records were located.The complaint says that Leopold appealed the FBI s response but was denied by the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Information in 2013.
In its appeal decision, OIP claimed that the FBI is not required to perform cross-reference searches unless the requester provides information sufficient to enable the FBI to determine with certainty that any cross-references it locates are identifiable to the subject of [the] request, including, for example, the dates and locations of contacts between the subject of the request and the FBI, the subject s social security number, or other such information, the suit reads.However, BuzzFeed and Leopold contend in the complaint, Nothing in the FOIA statute requires a requester to provide this information before a cross-reference search must be conducted.
As FBI and OIP are certainly aware, Andrew Breitbart was a well-known public figure and is easily identifiable by the FBI in conducting a cross-reference search, the suit reads.
As the FBI and OIP are also aware, cross-reference searches frequently turn up records not located in main file searches.
