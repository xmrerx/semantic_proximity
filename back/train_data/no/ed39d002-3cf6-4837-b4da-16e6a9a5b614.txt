nbc news third post-leaked audio , post-second debate poll shows something quite shocking ( but not really ) : hillary clinton is gaining an insurmountable lead over donald trump , with just three weeks left to go until election day.the new poll , conducted october 10 through the 13th , with 1,000 respondents , shows clinton with an 11-point lead , 48 to 37 percent over trump .
gary johnson , the libertarian candidate , has seven percent in support and green party candidate jill stein has 2 percent.in a head-to-head matchup , clinton maintains a 10 point lead , 51-41 , with 10 percent undecided.as nbc news put it : to put clinton s current 11-point lead into perspective , barack obama beat john mccain by seven points nationally in 2008 .
and obama s margin of victory over mitt romney in 2012 was four points.both pollsters who coordinated with nbc news , democrat fred yang and republican bill mcinturff , both came to the conclusion that trump does not have a chance of winning the presidency.one of the biggest contributing factors to clinton s lead in her 20 point advantage with women ( 55-35 percent ) , her 60 point advantage with non-white voters ( 76-16 percent ) , and her gain among men in which she s behind by just three points , 48-45 percent.the poll als0 shows president obama s approval rating at 53 percent , a positive for clinton heading into the final stretch of the election.now that the polls have shown a consistent lead for clinton , trump has no other way to legitimize his failing , pathetic campaign than to claim it s going to be rigged against them thanks to minority communities , dead people , a globalist conspiracy.now that infowars has overtaken his campaign , the public has been turned off and are showing that they are ready for hillary.nate silver s fivethirtyeight currently gives clinton an 86 percent chance of winning the election and trump a 14 percent chance .
this marks the 10th day that clinton has been in the high 80s , the same place she was at after the democratic national convention.trump has a lot of ground came to catch up on .
can he do it in three weeks ?
who knows , but it s not looking good for him.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images
