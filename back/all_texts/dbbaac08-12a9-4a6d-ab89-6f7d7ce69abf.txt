This is insane!WATCH: Protests erupted in Chicago Tuesday night in the wake of first-degree murder charges being brought against a police officer who shot and killed a 17-year-old black man in October 2014.Watch this young punk staring down a cop who is just standing in place defending the protesters.
This tough guy has been emboldened by the Barack Obama-Eric Holder race and cop war that was started when Trayvon Martin was killed by White Hispanic George Zimmerman.
Thug Michael Brown s death just gave these hate organizer a reason to pass the baton to a whole new group of rioters in another geographic area.Now, one year after a shooting incident that left a young black man dead and a police officer facing first degree murder charges, we see it happening all over again in Obama s hometown of Chicago.Things get pretty heated in this exchange during the Megan Kelly show.
This is Obama s legacy.
This is how he ll be remembered:// <!
