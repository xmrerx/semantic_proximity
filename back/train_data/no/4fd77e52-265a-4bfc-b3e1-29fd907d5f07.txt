this is in such poor judgement by the teachers of this school .
you have to wonder what they were thinking ! a number of teachers in a texas school district are being disciplined after naming a student most likely to become a terrorist .
lizeth villanueva , a seventh grader , received a certificate during a mock awards ceremony tuesday at anthony aguirre junior high in channelview , texas , near houston .
lizeth said the teacher who signed it handed out certificates to a number of students while other teachers watched and laughed .
they just found it as a joke , said lizeth , 13.the awards were given out a day after the suicide bombing at the end of the ariana grande concert in manchester , england .
she said that some people might get offended , but she doesn t really care about our feelings , lizeth said .
she was laughing about it .
it s no laughing matter to lizeth s mom .
i read it twice .
i m like , what is this ? !
