it turns out the hypocrite , liberal , golden state warriors coach steve kerr doesn t just whine about calls , he also cried about trump s win during a recent press conference .
besides the totally unfounded racism accusations he makes about trump , it s interesting how offended kerr is over trump s private conversation he had with another single guy , that was secretly recorded .
he must have forgotten his public defense of one of his players , draymond green after he was caught sending a picture of his penis to everyone on his snapchat list.steve kerr `` this is my rant '' for 2+ minutes on the presidential election : `` maybe we should 've seen this coming '' pic.twitter.com/mjocsdxxhh anthony slater ( @ anthonyvslater ) november 10 , 2016draymond green got in trouble for hitting lebron in the nuts when the golden state warriors played the cavaliers during the nba finals .
in july , green was exposed for posting a dick pic on his public snapchat story.the nsfw photo , which was quickly deleted , was , of course , captured by the internet for posterity .
green initially tried to play it off as a hacking a tactic that worked really well for disgraced former congressman anthony weiner.golden state warriors head coach steve kerr has been fined $ 25,000 for public criticism of officiating , it was announced today by kiki vandeweghe , executive vice president , basketball operations .
how is it that everybody on earth can see these traveling violations except for the three people that we pay to do the job ?
i don t get it .
it s bizarre , kerr said on knbr 680 .
it s ( traveling ) a point of emphasis on one particular play and that s when you catch and go it s just the one that the officials are taught to see .
kerr made his comments during a radio interview thursday , nov. 17 .
