seoul ( reuters ) - south korea s coast guard said it fired 249 warning shots over a group of chinese fishing boats swarming around one of its patrol ships in south korean waters , prompting a call for restraint from beijing .
south korean coast guard vessels regularly chase chinese boats suspected of fishing illegally in south korean waters , at times sparking violent confrontations , complicating a relationship which is key to efforts to try to rein in north korea s nuclear and missile programs .
a fleet of 44 chinese fishing boats fortified with iron bars and steel mesh on tuesday began to rush the patrol boat which broadcast warnings to steer clear , the coast guard said .
the coast guard vessel fired 249 shots over the boats until they retreated .
the chinese fishing boats sought to swarm around and collide with our patrol ship , ignoring the broadcast warnings , the coast guard said in a statement .
china , which has in the past lodged diplomatic protests with south korea over the use of force by its coast guard , expressed serious concern about the reports .
we hope that south korea appropriately handles the relevant issue and in the course of law enforcement takes no extreme actions that endanger people s safety , foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told reporters in beijing .
seoul s foreign ministry said the coast guard followed domestic law in its use of weapons in a legitimate step against the boats which made a mass violation of the country s waters for illegal fishing .
in september last year , three chinese fishermen were killed in a fire on their boat when a south korean coast guard crew trying to apprehend them for illegal fishing threw flash grenades into a room where they were hiding , according to the south korean coast guard .
a month later , two chinese fishing boats illegally fishing in south korean waters crashed into and sank a coast guard vessel , the coast guard officials said .
