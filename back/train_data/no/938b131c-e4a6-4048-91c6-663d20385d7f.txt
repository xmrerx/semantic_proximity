district judge william orrick issued the temporary ruling tuesday in a lawsuit over the executive order targeting so-called sanctuary cities .
the decision will stay in place while the lawsuit moves through court.the republican president s administration and two california governments that sued over the order disagreed about its scope.san francisco and santa clara county argued that it threatened billions of dollars in federal funding.but an attorney for the justice department , chad readler , said at a recent court hearing that it applied to a limited set of grants.some of judge orrick s comments are shocking : judge orrick said trump s order by its plain language , attempts to reach all federal grants , not merely the three mentioned at the hearing .
the rest of the order is broader still , addressing all federal funding .
and if there was doubt about the scope of the order , the president and attorney general have erased it with their public comments .
federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement can not be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves .
note that once again activist judges use public comments just like they did in the prior block to an executive order .
