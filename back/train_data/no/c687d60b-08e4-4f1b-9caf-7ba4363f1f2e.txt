what if 20 million illegal aliens vacated america ? it s a good question it deserves an honest answer .
over 80 % of americans demand secured borders and illegal migration stopped .
but what would happen if all 20 million or more vacated america ?
the answers i found may surprise you ! in california , if 3.5 million illegal aliens moved back to mexico , it would leave an extra $ 10.2 billion to spend on overloaded school systems , bankrupt hospitals and overrun prisons .
it would leave highways cleaner , safer and less congested .
everyone could understand one another as english became the dominant language again.in colorado , 500,000 illegal migrants , plus their 300,000 kids and grandchilds would move back home , mostly to mexico .
that would save colorado an estimated $ 2 billion ( other experts say $ 7 billion ) annually in taxes that pay for schooling , medical , social-services and incarceration costs .
it means 12,000 gang members would vanish out of denver alone.colorado would save more than $ 20 million in prison costs , and the terror that those 7,300 alien criminals set upon local citizens .
denver officer don young and hundreds of colorado victims would not have suffered death , accidents , rapes and other crimes by illegals.denver public schools would not suffer a 67 % dropout/flunk rate because of thousands of illegal alien students speaking 41 different languages .
at least 200,000 vehicles would vanish from our gridlocked cities in colorado .
denver s 4 % unem ployment rate would vanish as our working poor would gain jobs at a living wage.in florida , 1.5 million illegals would return the sunshine state back to america , the rule of law , and english.in chicago , illinois , 2.1 million illegals would free up hospitals , schools , prisons and highways for a safer , cleaner and more crime-free experience.if 20 million illegal aliens returned home , the u.s. economy would return to the rule of law .
employers would hire legal american citizens at a living wage .
everyone would pay their fair share of taxes because they wouldn t be working off the books .
that would result in an additional $ 401 billion in irs income taxes collected annually , and an equal amount for local , state and city coffers.no more push 1 for spanish or 2 for english .
no more confusion in american schools that now must contend with over 100 languages that degrade the educational system for american kids .
our overcrowded schools would lose more than two million illegal alien kids at a cost of billions in esl and free breakfasts and lunches.we would lose 500,000 illegal criminal alien inmates at a cost of more than $ 1.6 billion annually .
that includes 15,000 ms-13 gang members who distribute $ 130 billion in drugs annually would vacate our country.in cities like l.a. , 20,000 members of the 18th street gang would vanish from our nation .
no more mexican forgery gangs for id theft from americans !
no more foreign rapists and child molesters ! losing more than 20 million people would clear up our crowded highways and gridlock .
cleaner air and less drinking and driving american deaths by illegal aliens !

illegal alien crimes committed in u.s.a. statistics : cis ice continued to release deportable criminal aliens from its custody at an alarming rate in 2015 , according to figures the agency provided to members of congress this week in advance of a hearing taking place thursday , april 28 .
in 2015 , ice freed 19,723 criminal aliens , who had a total of 64,197 convictions among them .
these included 8,234 violent convictions and 208 homicide convictions .
while the total number of releases is lower than the past two years , since the number of arrests has declined quite dramatically , the rate of releases is approximately the same meaning that this is no progress at all , and certainly will be no consolation for the victims of these criminal aliens.the table below enumerates the criminal convictions associated with the released aliens .
the largest number of convictions was for driving under the influence ; there were 12,307 alcohol dui convictions and 354 drug dui convictions , for a total of 12,661.convictions for alien criminals released convictions number of convictions traffic offense : driving under the influence , liquor 12,307 traffic offense 9,811 dangerous drugs 7,986 larceny 3,535 immigration 3,064 obstructing judiciary/congress/legislature , etc .
