Conservative radio show host Alex Jones recently proclaimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton are really demons, sent by Lucifer himself no doubt.
No, he did not mean metaphorically.
He meant literally.
As proof of their evil origins, Jones claimed that they both smell like sulphur and hell.
Apparently, somebody mentioned to this to the president.
So, while speaking at an event on the campaign trail for Clinton, Obama decided to give himself a sniff test on Tuesday night, just to check for any suspicious demonic odors.
we demonize each other.
And I mean that literally, by the way.
I was reading the other day, there s a guy on the radio who apparently, Trump s on his show frequently, he said me and Hillary are demons.
Said we smell like sulphur.
Ain t that somethin ?
President Obama then performed his sniff test, smelling his hand as the crowd laughed at the absurdity of Jones bullsh*t. Now, the president began before he burst into laughter along with the crowd.
I mean, come on, people!
This is what the right wing nut jobs have reduced us to.
Our president has to sniff himself to make sure he isn t actually a f*cking demon.This happened.
Obama responds to Alex Jones saying he and Hillary are literal demons who smell like sulfur.
