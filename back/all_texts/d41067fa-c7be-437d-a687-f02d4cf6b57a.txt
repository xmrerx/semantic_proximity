WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A man who jumped over the White House fence last week was on the grounds for 16 minutes before he was apprehended, the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement on Friday.
“The Secret Service can confirm that at no time did the individual gain entry into the White House,” the statement said.
