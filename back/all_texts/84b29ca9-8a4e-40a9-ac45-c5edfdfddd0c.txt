Donald Trump was on a phone interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo and let him have it!
Cuomo started out with a question about Trump attacking Hillary and Trump was livid.
It s damn refreshing to see the left wing media get a shove.
Bravo Trump!
First of all you should congratulate me for having won the race.
I thought, you know, at least there would be a small congratulations, but I m not surprised with CNN, because that s the way they treat Trump.
It s the, you know, they call it the Clinton Network and I believe that.
