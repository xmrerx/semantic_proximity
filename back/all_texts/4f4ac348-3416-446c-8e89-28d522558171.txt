HARARE (Reuters) - A Zimbabwean court has postponed to Jan. 4 the trial of a U.S. citizen accused of attempting to undermine the authority of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe s government.
Martha O Donovan, 25, who is currently free on bail, denies the charges which center on a Twitter post the state says she wrote in October calling 93-year-old Mugabe a selfish and sick man .
Mugabe resigned a few weeks later in the wake of a de facto military coup and was succeeded by Emmerson Mnangagwa, who Mugabe had sacked as his deputy only a week before.
The state said it needed more time to complete its investigations into the allegations against O Donovan, who works for Magamba TV, which describes itself as Zimbabwe s leading producer of political satire.
When he released her on bail last month, High Court Judge Clement Phiri said there was patent absence of facts in the state s case against her.
