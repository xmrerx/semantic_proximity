just another tolerant violent liberal , shooting a man who defended his nation because he didn t agree with his opinion who gave the left the green light to use violence to shut up an opposing view ? a political discussion at a bar in cleveland ended with a vietnam vet being shot in the leg because of his support for donald trump.60-year-old paul jones , jr. was having a conversation with a friend at winston s place near e. 131st street and miles avenue on monday evening.a man sitting nearby overheard the chat and immediately became aggressive .
he butted in the conversation , jones told wews from his hospital bed .
the conversation wasn t directed at him or to him .
the man continued to get more irate , going to his car to retrieve a gun before he returned and shot jones in the thigh.the shooter fled the scene and detectives are still searching for him .
i m quite sure you have a lot of people having their own opinions .
but that doesn t mean you should hurt somebody because you have your own opinion , said jones mother latosca.via : infowarsh/t gateway pundit
