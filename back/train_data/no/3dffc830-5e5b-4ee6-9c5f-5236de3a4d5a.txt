washington ( reuters ) - democratic u.s. senators tried to force a vote on a bill to rescind president donald trump ’ s order banning travel from seven muslim-majority nations on monday , but were blocked by a republican lawmaker .
democratic senator dianne feinstein said she had 27 co-sponsors of a bill to rescind the order trump signed on friday , but under senate rules it takes only one member to prevent a vote .
republican senator tom cotton blocked consideration of the measure .
it would have faced a difficult fight for passage in the senate , where trump ’ s fellow republicans hold a 52-48 seat majority .
trump ’ s directive on friday put a 120-day hold on allowing refugees into the country , an indefinite ban on refugees from syria and a 90-day bar on citizens from iran , iraq , libya , somalia , sudan , syria and yemen .
the president argues that his action will protect americans , but critics say it illegally singles out muslims , violating u.s. law , and defiles america ’ s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants .
more than 160 democrats in the u.s. house of representatives introduced legislation in that chamber to defund and rescind trump ’ s order .
but that measure is unlikely to advance in the house , where republicans hold a 240-193 seat advantage , larger than their advantage in the senate .
