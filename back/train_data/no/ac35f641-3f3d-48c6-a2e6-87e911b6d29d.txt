a disturbing video published by the washington post on june 29 shows a group of brainwashed students singing twitter posts by president donald trump attempting to mock him .
a group of about twelve children , entitled washington post kids chorus , are shown in a classroom banging on drums and waving american flags .
the video is called the washington post s kids chorus singing president trump s tweets .
following their mockery of president donald trump , the class sings the post s new motto : democracy dies in darkness .the post does not state the name of the school or location where the mockery took place .
the video , which was published on june 29 to the post s verified youtube account was also mentioned in the june 30 column , the daily 202 , titled the daily 202 presents the world debut of the washington post kids chorus .
their first musical assignment had a political twist : the president s tweets .
from our video team : .viewers who were disgusted in the washington post video made some of the following comments : how about we leave 5-year-olds out of politics ?
anything else is borderline brainwashing .
let the kids decide for themselves what their political beliefs are .
no one else believes you so you have to trick children to push your narrative .
this is just beyond wrong and twisted .
the left have always used children as political props .
they control the schools so they have ready access .
this is like north korean propaganda .
let s use our children .
washington post was once great , but no more .
