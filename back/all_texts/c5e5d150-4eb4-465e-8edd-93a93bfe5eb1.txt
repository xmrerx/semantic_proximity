GOP Congressman Darrell Issa offered the most disgusting defense of Trump s Muslim ban one could imagine.
During an appearance on FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS CNN Monday, Issa was asked if white supremacist piece of shit Steve Bannon wrote the executive order that caused thousands and thousands of people to rise up in opposition to Trump.Issa explained that he isn t sure Bannon wrote the order (it has since been blamed on a close friend of influential Nazi Richard Spencer, who recently got punched in the face in a video that went viral), but explained that The president is trying to react to a crisis that has been ongoing for a period of time.
According to Issa, Democrats are to blame for not confirming Trump s pro-Putin, Muslim ban-supporting Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson quickly enough.
That s deflection, CNN s Carol Costello replied.
Should he have waited, then, for the secretary of state to be confirmed (so) he could have consulted with Rex Tillerson?
Issa pointed out that Barack Obama took a parting shot at ISIS< bombing militants as he exited the White House because that is totally the same as banning people because they come from a country that Trump thinks has too many Muslims.
Your are the president every day you re the president, Issa says.
According to the Hillary Clinton witch hunter, the Muslim ban is fine because this sort of bigoted discrimination happens every day with to people of this color.
Issa pointed to his own face in an effort to make the point that white people sometimes are asked to step aside for additional screening (something that is normal for Muslims with darker complexions).There you have it, folks.
White people sometimes have to deal with a small amount of additional bother at airports, so it s perfectly fine to detain people because of their religion.
