(Reuters) - A Virginia federal judge on Monday issued a preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump’s travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations, the latest legal setback for the administration.
The ruling from U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema came in response to a request from the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Brinkema said the Justice Department had responded to Virginia’s injunction request with “no evidence.”
