Joe Scarborough is not having the best morning.
On Morning Joe earlier today, the conversation turned to the number of Trump family members who are serving in the White House and the rampant nepotism there.
This led Scarborough to compare President Donald Trump s daughter, Ivanka, to a Robert F. Kennedy.Scarborough said that having Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, working for him in the West Wing created the same kind of situation that upset so many Republicans during the Kennedy administration.
When Host Mika Brzezinski questioned that logic, Scarborough did not take it well.Scarborough s rant went like this, You don t have to be so snotty.
I was about to say, you didn t let me get it out.
You don t have to be so rude.
The fact of the matter is that they are not Bobby Kennedy as I was about to say but you wanted to get your cheap shot in so you got your cheap shot in.
No I am not saying Jared and Ivanka are Bobby Kennedy.
Maybe it s time for the host to switch to decaf.Here s the video:Featured image via Carolyn Cole/Getty Images.
