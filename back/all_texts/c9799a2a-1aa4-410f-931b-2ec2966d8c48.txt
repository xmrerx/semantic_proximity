Sebastian Gorka defended the Trump administration s use of the phrase radical Islamic terrorism in an appearance on MSNBC Tuesday.
We will call it radical Islamic terrorism.
We will target the ideology, and we will call them out for being evil, Gorka stated.
MSNBC s Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle then tried to criticize Gorka s use of the phrase.Velshi asked Gorka how it would help stop terror attacks if the White House called the problem radical Islamic terrorism.
Gorka then engaged a clever metaphor to help them understand.

Ruhle responded, smugly, that there s still no cure for cancer and that it doesn t matter what you call it if it will still kill you.Velshi then accused Gorka of not having a good answer.
Gorka fired back by saying that if you misdiagnose anything, whether it s a serious disease or a serious international geopolitical threat, you will never solve it.
