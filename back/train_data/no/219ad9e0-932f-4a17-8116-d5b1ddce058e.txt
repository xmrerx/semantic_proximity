once again , the comedic geniuses at saturday night live proved their prowess when they lambasted the embarrassing quagmire of bullsh * t , hysteria , and jingoistic , nonsensical willful ignorance that was the first gop debate of 2016 .
as always , republicans failed to present a single workable idea at bettering our nation , but they did provide some downright hilarious soundbytes like ted cruz and donald trump s hilarious attempts to out- birther one another , or carson s paranoid claims that isis hackers will down our electrical grid ( even though squirrels are actually a bigger threat than any hacker ) .the snl cast poked fun at lindsey graham s departure from the race ( yes , we assure you he was running for president ) , chris christie s almost unredeemable unpopularity and terrible temper , ted cruz s supposed ineligibility for office ( let s face it he s eligible , just awful ) , christie s nonsensical desire to kick obama out of the white house ( which he will be leaving of his own accord next january no matter what ) , jebrah bush s stupid clinton joke , and other hits from the real embarrassment to america that was the debate .
they even translated ted cruz s new york values remark for us.sure , we can laugh , but when you think about it one of the men who mainstaged the debate has an almost barely perceptible yet present chance of becoming the next president if democrats don t get out and vote .
look what the gop accomplished in 2014 , after all.as you watch this , consider that the snl cast didn t have to reach very far for their jokes most of them were almost directly written by the republicans extensive cast of bigots , hatemongers , and monumental imbeciles from the 2016 field.for now , of course , we ll just laugh and hope the joke doesn t become too real.watch the hilarious video below : [ youtube https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=nzysfuve9xm & w=420 & h=315 ] featured image via screengrab
