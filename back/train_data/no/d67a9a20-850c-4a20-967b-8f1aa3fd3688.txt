panama city ( reuters ) - panama recalled its ambassador to the eu from brussels for consultations after the central american country was included on a european union blacklist of countries deemed as tax havens , the government said on wednesday .
european union finance ministers adopted a blacklist of 17 jurisdictions deemed tax havens on tuesday , in an unprecedented step to counter worldwide tax avoidance , although they did not agree on financial levies for the listed countries .
given the unfortunate incorporation of the country in this discriminatory list , the republic of panama has decided to call its ambassador to the european union , dario chiru , to assess the steps to be followed moving forward , the government said in a statement .
the list also included american samoa , bahrain , barbados , grenada , guam , south korea , macau , marshall islands , mongolia , namibia , palau , saint lucia , samoa , trinidad and tobago , tunisia and united arab emirates ( uae ) .
the government of the caribbean islands of trinidad and tobago said on wednesday that it soon would take two bills to parliament to reform its tax codes .
passage of those bills could help it get removed from the eu blacklist , the government said .
the government of trinidad and tobago shares the goals of the eu with respect to fighting tax abuse and reassures that we will act with alacrity on this matter , the country s attorney general said in a statement
