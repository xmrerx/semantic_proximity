Politico reports that Barack and Michelle Obama will not be attending the funeral for racist, hate-mongering, recently deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
While it is unlikely that Scalia, who opposed marriage and gender equality, voting protections for African-Americans, affordable healthcare, and everything else the President stands for, would have wanted Obama to be in attendance at his funeral (if nothing else, because of the President s skin color), conservatives are downright furious that the socialist, Communist, anti-Christian, Muslim, atheist, Kenyan dictator will not be in attendance.
The president and the First :ady on Friday will travel to the Supreme Court to pay their respects to Justice Scalia as he lies in repose there at the Supreme Court, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced Wednesday, adding that Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will attend Justice Scalia s funeral at the Basilica on Saturday.
Currently, Scalia s body lies in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court where the public, including President Obama, is invited to pay their respects something the President and First Lady will certainly do.
Unfortunately, this was not enough for the inbred, meth-fueled informed readers at right-wing blog Twitchy.
Even the liberal media got in some jabs.
NBC reports:When asked whether Obama s Saturday plans include golfing, Earnest stressed instead that the president believes it is important to honor Scalia s life and service.President Obama is paying his respects to Scalia in the court.
The Vice President and his spouse will be in attendance.
No one did anything wrong.
But this is yet another example of the right-wing hate machine finding every reason possible to disparage the President.Featured image from Philly.com/screengrab
