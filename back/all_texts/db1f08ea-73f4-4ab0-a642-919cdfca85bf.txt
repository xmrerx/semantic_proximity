WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A House of Representatives committee said on Tuesday it will consider this week a resolution asking President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to provide documents related to Trumpâ€™s firing of James Comey as FBI director.
The House Judiciary Committee said it would consider the resolution of inquiry asking Trump to provide the documents to the House and directing Sessions to do so on Thursday.
Trump fired Comey, who was overseeing the investigation of ties between his campaign and Russia, on May 9.
Moscow has denied any effort to influence the 2016 U.S. election, and Trump has disputed any allegations of collusion between his associates and Russia.
