donald trump once said that he loves the poorly educated , and he skips his intelligence briefings regularly , so it is reasonable to assume that he is not a fan of intelligence in any form .
but on thursday , the donald took to twitter to assure everyone that this isn t true and to backtrack on his agreements with julian assange so fast that one is forced to wonder what information he learned about russia s hack of the election in the past 24 hours .
the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong .
i simply state what he states , it is for the people , trump tweeted , apparently forgetting that his vapid , meth-addled nazi followers prefer him to use the word l genpresse , to make up their own minds as to the truth .
the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan ! the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong .
i simply state what he states , it is for the people .

the media lies to make it look like i am against `` intelligence '' when in fact i am a big fan !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 5 , 2017the hacked emails were not just distributed by assange , who is currently hiding out from rape charges in an embassy , but by guccifer 2.0 and dc leaks as well two web sites run by actual , bona fide , russian agents .
nevertheless , though he admits he doesn t look into who gives him information , assange claims that he didn t receive the emails from russia .
on wednesday , trump mindlessly parroted the claim because it supports his nonsensical decision to spend every waking moment doing the twitter equivalent of dropping to his knees in front of putin and , well , you get the idea.in his nonsensical morning tweet , wednesday edition , trump informed the world that his intelligence ( yes , he put the word in quotes again ) had been delayed by a few days and attacked intelligence agencies ( he could have meant any of the more than a bakers dozen who say that russia absolutely hacked us , and putin led the operation , but he seems to mean the cia ) .
this was a lie.he followed that up by spreading assange s nonsensical claim that their friend vladdy poot didn t give him the information and by attacking the dnc for getting hacked.but even though the donald regularly tweets out agreements with assange including the false claim that russia had nothing to do with the hack ( something he would know if he actually attended intelligence briefings ) he says his tweets should not be construed as agreement with the sexual predator behind the release of some of the hacked documents russian hackers stole .
naturally , twitter stepped in and did the online equivalent of beating trump with a broom handle : @ realdonaldtrump only you would use `` intelligence '' in quotes as if it 's always theoretical .

i do n't think you know what you want to say .
for the people billy spillwater ( @ billyspillwater ) january 5 , 2017interestingly , in 2010 , trump didn t agree with assange so much as he wanted to have him murdered .
you see , before russia and wikileaks teamed up to hack and release information about his opponent in what the intelligence community agrees was an effort to install him in office , the donald said that assange is disgraceful and that there should be like death penalty or something for his new rapist friend.putin , on the other hand , trump has just always loved .
a few years back , the donald tweeted that he hopes the brutal russian dictator becomes his new best friend .
it s nice that we re all friends now , and that assange and trump are bonding over the dishonest press , but if trump is getting his intelligence from russia and some rapist , it s time we talk about peacefully removing him from the white house and what was that thing he wanted to do to his opponent , who had legitimately not committed a crime ?
oh , yes , locking him up .
