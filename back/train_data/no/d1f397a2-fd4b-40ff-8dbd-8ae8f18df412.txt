beirut ( reuters ) - a top aide to president bashar al-assad said on friday the syrian government would fight any force , including u.s.-backed forces also battling islamic state militants , in its drive to recapture the whole of the country .
assad has previously vowed to recapture the whole of syria .
the government controls the main urban centres in the west of the country and has taken back much of the eastern desert from islamic state in recent months .
whether it s the syrian democratic forces , or daesh ( islamic state ) or any illegitimate foreign force in the country ... we will fight and work against them so our land is freed completely from any aggressor , bouthaina shaaban said in an interview with hezbollah s al manar tv .
shaaban said the u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) had captured areas from islamic state without any fighting , apparently accusing them of collusion with the jihadists .
the sdf are trying to get areas ( where there is ) oil ... but they will not get what they want , she said .
shaaban also said plans to divide syria had failed , without elaborating .
the kurdish ypg militia , which dominates the sdf , has for years controlled large parts of northeastern syria .
advances against islamic state in its raqqa stronghold and a new offensive in deir al-zor are bringing more territory under the control of the sdf .
