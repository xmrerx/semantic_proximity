Donald Trump has no idea WTF he is doing.
None.
I know, shocking, right?
Thankfully, President Obama has decided to take pity on him (or maybe he s really taking pity on us) and is planning to help Trump figure out just how this president gig actually works.After winning the election on Tuesday, Trump visited the White House to meet with Obama and formally begin the process of transition.
Sources familiar with the meeting told the Wall Street Journal that it quickly became abundantly clear that Trump was completely clueless.
Trump and his team didn t even know that they were responsible for staffing the West Wing.
The president has concluded that, for the good of the entire country, he is going to have to help his successor try to learn a thing or two.The WSJ reports: During their private White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country, and Mr. Trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting.
Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama s term.
After meeting with Mr. Trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, Mr. Obama realized the Republican needs more guidance.
He plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do, people familiar with the matter said.
To say that Trump is inexperienced is a grave understatement.
He and all the people that he has working for him, who are the best people if you remember, couldn t manage to google this shit?
But President Obama, being the true leader that he is, has decided that he will take one for the team and spend his last days in office mentoring the buffoon who will take his place.
Thanks, Obama.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
