Hey Al you do realize that Obama was more than happy to give jobs that should have gone to the black communities to refugees, don t you?
Before you head to church today, remember to thank God for his son, Jesus a refugee who fled to Egypt.
Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) January 29, 2017Here are a few responses to Sharpton s lie on Twitter:@Wargs77 @jccolange @StephenKing umm, his parents weren't refugees.
They traveled to pay their taxes.
Please Al MC (@mcolange) January 29, 2017This one is our favorites:He paid his taxes unlike you.
Different times, no comparison.
He also returned to his home.
Bryan K. Davis (@BryanDavis2014) January 29, 2017This guy REALLY owned Sharpton with this response:You are no Reverend.
You're a viper who spews poison.
An angel of the Lord commanded Joseph to flee to Egypt.
Repent, Al.

Jesus never fled to Egypt, His mother and father did but only for a short time, then they went back #Butch52 Davaughn Wistrom (@Butch452) January 29, 2017And finally the fake news slam!
