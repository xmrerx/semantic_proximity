The women in this video are serious minded voters.
They are moms who fear for the safety of their children and grandchildren.
They speak for so many of us who are sick and tired of living under a government who puts the safety and security of our nation after political correctness.We are living in perilous times, and it s comforting to know that there are so many female voters who believe our nation s security should take priority over the genitalia of our next President.
There s more to choosing a leader of the greatest nation on earth than the abortion issue.
It won t matter if you can take the life of an innocent child in your womb up to the moment of conception if you re living under an oppressive Sharia Law or under Communist rule.Here s a newsflash for our media and the Femi-Nazi s who would go into a polling place and vote for Hillary simply because she s a woman: Russia, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and China don t care if our next President is pro-abortion or if she has a vagina
