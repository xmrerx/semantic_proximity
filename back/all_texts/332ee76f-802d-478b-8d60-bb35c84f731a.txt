White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders revealed she says a little prayer of God help me each day before walking into the briefing room during an interview on Fox News Sunday.
Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary herself, mentioned she would say a prayer of thanks and gratitude as she would arrive at the building each morning.
Sanders, speaking about her job taking questions as the Trump administration s chief spokesperson, expressed both love for the job and said there was hostility from the press she has never seen.
I ve always said if I ever walk into the building and I m not in awe of being here and being part of it, then I ve been here too long and it s time to go, Sanders said.
Thankfully, I still feel a sense of reverence every time I step into the building, certainly every time I step into the briefing room.
And I hope I never lose that.
I also say a little prayer of God help me every day right before walking into that room, she added.OUR MOST RECENT REPORT ON SANDERS: ALL HAT, NO CATTLE Sarah Sanders hit back at criticism that General Kelly was fabricating his account of Rep.
