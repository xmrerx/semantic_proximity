Hillary Clinton visited a predominately black church in North Carolina on Sunday, where she checked her privilege at the door to discuss to discuss racism, gun violence, and police shootings.Speaking at Little Rock AME Zion Church in Charlotte, the Democratic candidate told the crowd that she was all too aware that the world her grandchildren were growing up in was a far cry from that facing America s black youth.
Clinton addressed the epidemic of police shootings in the U.S., a result of what she has termed implicit bias.
The former Secretary of State lamented the deaths of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher in Tulsa and 43-year-old Keith Scott, whose killing sparked days of protests in Charlotte.
I m a grandmother, and like every grandmother, I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, who have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face, Clinton said.Clinton also spoke of 10-year-old Taje Gaddy and 9-year-old Zianna Oliphant, who testified before the Charlotte City Council last week.
The girls tearfully told of the impact this violence has had on their lives.
At one point, Clinton invited Oliphant to join her on the stage.
I wouldn t be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now.
But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let s be honest here, they won t face the kind of fear that we heard from the children testifying before the city council, Clinton said.Gun violence has been one of the main themes of Clinton s campaign and she has been supported by mothers of gun violence victims throughout her run for the presidency.
Clinton has demanded better training for police officers, including education on implicit bias.
In the days following Scott s killing, she called for Charlotte police to release the dash cam and body cam videos of his death.What Clinton s moving speech, here:Featured image via video screen capture
