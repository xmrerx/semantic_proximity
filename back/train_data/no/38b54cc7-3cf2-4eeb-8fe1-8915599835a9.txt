hong kong ( reuters ) - former british banker rurik jutting , who was jailed for life in hong kong last year for the gruesome murders of two indonesian women he tortured in his luxury apartment , is planning to appeal , his lawyer said on wednesday .
jutting , a former bank of america employee who is in his early thirties , denied murdering sumarti ningsih , 23 , and seneng mujiasih , 26 , in 2014 on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders .
he had pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped world media due to graphic video footage seen by the jury and the brutality of the killings .
the jury unanimously found jutting guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in the former british colony .
jutting s lawyer michael vidler said his appeal hearing would take place on december 12 .
he added that the appeal would focus on the directions given by the deputy judge to the jury .
cambridge educated jutting had showed no emotion when the verdict was read out in an open courtroom last november , packed with international and local journalists .
it took the jury , made up of four women and five men , around six hours , including a lunch break , to reach its decision .
in closing remarks , the judge had described jutting as the archetypal sexual predator who represented an extreme danger to women , especially in the sex trade .
he cautioned that the possibility of a repeat crime would have been very likely .
