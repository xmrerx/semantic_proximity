washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama will propose tailoring the controversial “ cadillac tax ” on expensive private health insurance plans to reflect regional differences when he releases his 2017 budget plan next week , a senior white house adviser said in an article released on wednesday .
obama 's proposal would reduce the bite of the unpopular tax by raising the threshold where it takes effect in areas where healthcare is particularly expensive , according to the article in the new england journal of medicine co-written by jason furman , chairman of the white house council of economic advisers .
( bit.ly/1qdgldg ) the tax on high-cost employer-based healthcare plans , passed as part of the president ’ s 2010 affordable care act and set to take effect in 2018 , has generated growing opposition in part because labor unions say it could encourage employers to cut back on health insurance plans for workers .
the tax was expected to raise some $ 87 billion a year to help pay for the reform generally known as obamacare .
white house officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
