Hillary Clinton announced her choice of Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her vice-presidential selection on Friday and, of course, Trump used the moment to mock Elizabeth Warren.In yet another effort to divide Democrats as the DNC Convention in Philadelphia approaches, Trump took to Twitter on Saturday morning to bully the Massachusetts Senator because she wasn t picked as Clinton s running mate.
Pocahontas wanted V.P.
slot so badly but wasn t chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate, Trump wrote before adding, Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2016Once again, the Republican nominee mocked Warren s Native American heritage and belittled her effort to fight for poor and middle class Americans in the US Senate.But Warren didn t let Trump get away with it and she responded by giving Trump bad news.
I m right where I want to be, @realDonaldTrump, she wrote.
Calling you out & holding you responsible for your reckless vision for America.

After all, when he threw a temper tantrum by call her lazy, as well as a fraud and Pocahontas last weekend because she shredded his veep choice Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Warren ripped him a new one for it with a series of tweets that were a direct hit on how Trump is the REAL fraud.Here s just a few of them.You want to talk about who s a fraud, @realDonaldTrump?
