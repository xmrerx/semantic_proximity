As is normal these days for Trump rallies, protesters and Trump supporters clashed outside just such a rally in Asheville, NC.
Police arrested five people and are looking for one more a man who punched a 69-year old woman in the face.Shirley Teter has been protesting all her life, and Trump gave her another reason to protest.
At 69, she s not in the best of health, and is actually on oxygen.
Nevertheless, she heckled the deplorable Trumpkins outside the rally: Why did I get involved yesterday, at my age?
Because I ran into another situation that was sickening my heart.
She admits to telling one Trumpkin he d better learn to speak Russian, at which point he socked her.
She fell on her oxygen tank and has sore ribs and a sore jaw, but nothing s broken.
She does, however, have a question for all the Trump supporters whose sugar-glass fragile egos were bruised by Hillary s basket of deplorables comment.She wants to know whether people find a Trump supporter punching her in the face deplorable.Because really, who hits a 69-year old woman on oxygen in the face for heckling?
And these people are upset that they re getting called deplorable?
That is some damned deplorable behavior right there.
There s no reason to hit someone over something they say, no matter how badly it makes your blood boil.Trump himself actually incites violence, and it seems these people think anything less than hitting people who don t bow and scrape before their king is being too politically correct.
At another rally recently, a deplorable Trump supporter hit a protesting woman in the face and she is the person who was escorted out.
That s not deplorable to these people?
Or are they proud to be the scum of the Earth like this?Watch a report below: Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
