If there s one thing you never do in life, it s piss off a New Yorker.
If there s one thing you really never do in life, it s make fun of New York City on national television telling a city of millions, a city where liberty literally stands, that it has bad values.Well, Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz has now done both of those things, and needless to say, the city is pretty damn pissed.
During the recent GOP debate, Cruz, tried to insult Trump by bashing New York values.
He said: Donald comes from New York and he embodies New York values Everybody understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal and pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage.
And focus on money and the media.
Donald Trump then turned to Cruz and promptly ripped the a**hole to shreds for such a blatantly horrific remark.Trump wasn t they only one upset, here is the latest New York Daily News cover: Stop the presses!
A new Page 1 DROP DEAD, TED: https://t.co/68hKgqmjBx pic.twitter.com/veDsxLYDTN New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) January 15, 2016The NY Daily News, alongside the Statue of Liberty offering the candidate the universal symbol for f*ck off, has instructed the Canadian-born Cruz to go back to Canada.Cruz, in his lame attempt to appeal to rural folks who are scared of the big, bad city, because people other than just folks who think like them live there, has now stepped in a monumental pile of sh*t made of his own word vomit.If Cruz needs a reminder of New York values let s give one to him.New York values embody a city that never sleeps, one that is always there, always vibrant, and always willing to take on the world, literally, it s where the UN is and where the Statue of Liberty stands.
The statue that embraces all.
A statue that is the very embodiment of the United States of America.New York is a city that has some of the most prestigious colleges, the best theater and art, and is home to millions of people who come from every corner of the earth.New York is a city, that when attacked in the worst domestic terror attack in the history of the nation, stood together, stood strong, never gave up on one another, and citizens literally gave their lives to save one another.THOSE are New York values, and for Cruz to trash New York City, he s showing himself as the un-American, horrible person that he truly is.
Way to let your smarmy true colors shine, Ted.Featured image: Twitter
