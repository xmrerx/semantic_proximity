A caucus formed by Politico consisting of operatives and strategists in ten battleground states around the country responded overwhelmingly they predict neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz will win the Republican Presidential nomination on the first ballot of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer.
Nearly 90 percent of the insiders in the Republican Party made this prediction, which is the hope and aspiration of many Republicans who are embarrassed both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have garnered so much support from Republican voters.Cruz and Trump s insane rhetoric and policy proposals almost make Ohio Governor John Kasich look like a Democrat in comparison.
As Republicans cannot come to a consensus over a presidential nominee, the Republican Party will likely fall apart at the convention.
If Donald Trump doesn t win the nomination after winning the most pledged delegates, he would likely make a third party run as his ego will not accept losing as an option.
His supporters will likely engage in violent protesting as the patients take over the insane asylum.
Trump supporters have treated anyone who dares defy the Donald at rallies with violence, there is no telling what they will do if the Republican Party doesn t hand over the keys to the presidential nomination.
Donald Trump has one chance to win the nomination, and that is on the first ballot.
Right now, I put his chances at about 40 percent, and that will require him to get some number of delegates from the unpledged delegates in states like North Dakota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and a few territories, an Iowa Republican said in his response to the Politico survey, which was conducted anonymously.
Even if Donald Trump does win the Republican nomination at the convention, so many Republicans despise him and his rise in the party, they would rather have a Democrat in the White House than listen to Donald Trump steer the direction of the GOP, which right now is going full speed off a cliff.Featured image courtesy of Flickr
