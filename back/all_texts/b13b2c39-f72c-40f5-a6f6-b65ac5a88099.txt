Pittsburgh Steelers players were absent from the sideline and remained in the locker room during the Star Spangled Banner.Alejandro Villanueva, who served three tours in Afghanistan, was the only Steelers player to stand outside the tunnel for the anthem.The protests from each team came in the wake of Trump s critical remarks toward players who don t stand for the anthem.Last week across the entire NFL, only four players knelt or sat, and two stood with their fists raised.
Daily MailEarlier today, President Trump sent out this tweet in response to the action of the NFL players:Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag we MUST honor and respect it!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017The Patriots players made their statement, and many fans did so in response.Before Sunday s Texans-Patriots matchup in Foxborough, Mass., about 20 Patriots players, according to ESPN, took a knee during the national anthem, the first time anyone on the team had joined the growing protest.In return, a loud chorus of boos was heard sandwiching the singing of The Star-Spangled Banner.
According to the Boston Herald, there were shouts of, Stand up, as they knelt.Tom Brady, the face of the team and the league, did not take a knee but stood with his arms locked with other players and his hand over his chest.The Patriots have been intertwined with Trump, with Brady, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft pals with the president.
After Trump s attack on the protests, though saying owners should cut ties with the son of a bitch who kneels during the anthem Kraft said he was deeply disappointed in Trump.It s been a Sunday in which not just players, but owners, executives, and fans have been forced to take a side.
There were similar reports of booing in Indianapolis, too.
NYPPresident Trump retweeted this awesome message from Donna Warren earlier today, reminding the NFL that if they choose to boycott our flag, we can boycott the NFL as well:You can boycott our anthem WE CAN BOYCOTT YOU!
