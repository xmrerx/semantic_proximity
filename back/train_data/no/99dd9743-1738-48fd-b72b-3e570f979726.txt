fired white house communications director anthony scaramucci gave up a lot for his 10-day job : his wife , who is divorcing him over his creepy obsession with donald trump , his future relationship with his newborn son who now knows forever that he is less important than sucking up to a fascist , his life ( according to harvard law school s alumni registry anyway ) , his self-respect ( if he ever had any ) , and finally his job itself because he was stupid enough to think he wouldn t get pushed out of the clown car.but at least he can look back over all those old embarrassing tweets he deleted for transparency and oops , looks like he missed one ! in 2012 , scaramucci tweeted something that appears to have been directed at barack obama , but seems to be more relevant to his own situation .
a recovery starts with a presidential pink slip , the mooch tweeted unironically at the time.naturally , the internet had quite a few collective har hars over this : literally a tweet for everything diana cannon ( @ arsonistkitten ) july 31 , 2017he forgot to delete this one .
