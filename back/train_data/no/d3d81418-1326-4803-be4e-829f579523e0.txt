cairo ( reuters ) - food security in the middle east and north africa is quickly deteriorating because of conflict in several countries in the region , the united nations said on thursday .
in those hardest hit by crises syria , yemen , iraq , libya and sudan an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished , the u.n. s food and agriculture organization said in its annual report on food security .
a quarter of yemen s people are on the brink of famine , several years into a proxy war between the iran-aligned houthis and the saudi-backed government of president abd-rabbu mansour hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times .
the report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000 .
it said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict , such as most gulf arab states and most north african countries including egypt , had slowly improved in the last decade .
but it had worsened in conflict-hit countries .
the costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition , the fao s assistant director-general abdessalam ould ahmed said .
decisive steps towards peace and stability ( need to be ) taken .
several countries in the region erupted into conflict following uprisings in 2011 that overthrew leaders in tunisia , egypt and libya .
syria s civil war , which also began with popular demonstrations , has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made more than 11 million homeless .
