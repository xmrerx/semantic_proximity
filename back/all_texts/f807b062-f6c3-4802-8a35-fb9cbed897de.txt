Pittsfield, New Hampshire is an unlikely place for something like an ISIS flag to show up.
That s why neighbors were shocked when the terrorist flag appeared in a local neighborhood hanging from a fence near the town dam and river.
Police immediately removed the flag from the fence which was on state property.JUST AN FYI: In the past 5 months, the state department has settled 290 Muslim refugees in New Hampshire.Pittsfield, NH has been designated a welcoming city which is code for BRING ON THE REFUGEES!
If you want to know the number of refugees who have come to your town in the past 5 months, please go here: WRAPSNETAuthorities are working with the FBI and have questioned a person of interest in this effort to flaunt a terrorist symbol.
The local authorities are now working with the FBI to determine if a crime was actually committed This chart is ridiculous!
Why are these people still here?
Why should Americans have to put up with having ISIS anywhere near us?
The Pittsfield Police Chief had this to say about the flag: Giving what that flag represents, it understandably caused public alarm and concern.
The flag itself is probably going to be protected under freedom of speech.
THE RESPONSE FROM NEIGHBORS IS GREAT:Neighbors are responding by flying American flags outside of their own homes.So what re we supposed to do about this person of interest ?
Will they now be on a watch list ?
It would be great to know more about this individual and their background.Read more: WGME
