diyarbakir , turkey ( reuters ) - a bomb planted by kurdish militants ripped into a military vehicle , killing four soldiers and wounding four more , as they traveled in southeast turkey near the border with iran on wednesday morning , local authorities said .
kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) militants were behind the attack , which occurred in the yuksekova district of hakkari province , the provincial governor s office said in a statement .
security sources said a large number of armored vehicles were sent to the site of the blast .
the governor s office said the wounded were being treated at a nearby hospital .
more than 40,000 people have been killed since the pkk launched its separatist insurgency in 1984 .
it is designated a terrorist group by turkey , the united states and european union .
the collapse of a peace process between the state and the pkk brought an end to a ceasefire in july 2015 and thousands have been killed in renewed fighting since then across mainly kurdish southeast turkey .
