tokyo ( reuters ) - the mayor of japan s western city of osaka plans to cut ties with u.s. sister city san francisco after the latter accepted the donation of a comfort women statue from a private group there .
the issue of comfort women , as those forced to work in japan s wartime military brothels were euphemistically known , has long embittered the ties of neighbors , such as china and south korea , with japan .
this is highly regrettable , osaka mayor hirofumi yoshimura told reporters , describing wednesday s endorsement by san francisco mayor edwin lee of a city council decision .
the relationship of trust has completely been destroyed .
yoshimura aims to complete the procedures necessary to snap ties by the end of the year , he said in a statement on thursday .
no officials at the san francisco mayor s office were immediately available for comment .
erecting comfort women statues in the united states and other countries is in conflict with our country s stance and extremely regrettable , japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told a regular news conference on friday .
we plan to continue making every effort so that things like this won t happen again .
in january , japan temporarily recalled its ambassador to south korea over a comfort women statue put up near its consulate in the southern city of busan .
in 2015 , japan and south korea agreed the issue of comfort women would be irreversibly resolved if both sides fulfilled their obligations , including a japanese apology and a fund to help victims .
but south korean president moon jae-in has said many south koreans did not accept the deal reached by his conservative predecessor and japanese prime minister shinzo abe .
on friday , suga said japan had protested to seoul after the south korean parliament passed a bill designating aug. 14 as a day of commemoration for comfort women , adding that the move risked affecting ties , kyodo news agency reported .
