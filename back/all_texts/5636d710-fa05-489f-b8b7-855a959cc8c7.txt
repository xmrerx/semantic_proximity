Never shy to speak her mind, Dixie Chicks Natalie Maines has clearly had enough of Donald Trump s shenanigans, and over the last several days, she has really been heating up her attacks.Not to go back too far, but let s take a look from about mid-March on.
Clearly not holding back, she posts this:I just love T.I.
's use of alliteration in his poetry;) pic.twitter.com/aEo15COU19 Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) March 16, 2017Then this:"Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom" Thomas Jefferson@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) March 17, 2017And this:"Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them, Donald Trump invents them."
Einstein/Maines@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) March 17, 2017Then Maines asks Trump a question that we d really all like answered: Well, [Trump], how do you see this all ending?I put my money on you being a quitter and blaming everybody else for it.
Well @realDonaldTrump how do you see this all ending?I put my money on you being a quitter and blaming everybody else for it.

Maines wrote: Do you ever feel like you can t escape the person that brings out the worst in you?
[Donald Trump] you re mine and I hate you for it.
Do you ever feel like you can't escape the person that brings out the worst in you?
@realDonaldTrump you're mine and I hate you for it.
Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) April 4, 2017And something we ve all thought.
Well, those of us with souls and a conscience, both of which Trump seems to lack:So, @realDonaldTrump I'm just desperate for you to care about all https://t.co/PhfD7LGqGQ,white,poor,rich,gay,straight.
I need you to care.
Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) April 4, 2017She didn t stop there:Because @realDonaldTrump in the end it's all that really https://t.co/pALRruTqmE pure was your heart?
Not how much $$ did you make?
Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) April 4, 2017I beg you @realDonaldTrump ,please make America great for people who don't even know from great.
Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) April 4, 2017That's what will make you a good human being that stops tweeting hatred and discrimination at 4AM.
@realDonaldTrump Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) April 4, 2017Just do right by human beings.
If you take $$ out of the equation, the same basic things bring every human happiness.
@realDonaldTrump Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) April 4, 2017That implies that Trump is actually human, and that has still yet to be determined.
The man lies with no remorse, surrounds himself with only folks who agree with him, and actually thinks that he s doing a good job.
How can we convince him otherwise if he s so absorbed within himself?
It may not even be possible.However, we thank you for trying, Natalie!
