vienna ( reuters ) - support for austria s ruling social democrats has slipped since a scandal embroiled the party ahead of an oct. 15 election but they are in a tight battle with the far right for second place , a poll showed on thursday .
foreign minister sebastian kurz s conservative people s party had 34 percent ahead of the far right freedom party on 27 percent , according to the research affairs poll published by tabloid daily oesterreich .
chancellor christian kern s social democrats had 22 percent down 2 percentage points but given a margin of error of 4.3 percent second place was too close to call .
the social democrats said last weekend it was unwittingly involved in two facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against kurz and the party chairman announced his resignation .
details of the scandal were unclear .
the party launched an investigation and a spokesman for the vienna prosecutor s office said on thursday it had opened a defamation inquiry against persons unknown based on a complaint by the social democrats .
we are conducting an investigation against persons unknown for defamation , a spokesman for the vienna prosecutors office said .
of course , we must now approach facebook and ask if they can help us further in seeking out these persons unknown .
facebook said on wednesday in response to a request for help from the social democrats : we are assessing the request and will reply once that assessment is complete .
like many polls in austria , the online survey carried out from monday to wednesday had a relatively small sample size of 600 people and a wide margin of error .
the people s party shot to first place in opinion polls when kurz took over as its leader in may .
other parties were on 6 percent or less .
