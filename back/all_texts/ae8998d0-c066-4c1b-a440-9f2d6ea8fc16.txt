Another girl hurt a Republican s feelings.
This time, it was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) who dropped a truth bomb on the GOP, which was too much for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to handle.
Trump s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) is being scrutinized for some very obvious reasons.
His history speaks for itself.Then this happened:McConnell took particular issue with Warren quoting a letter written by Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther King Jr. s widow, when Sessions was under consideration for a federal judgeship in 1986.McConnell invoked the little-used Rule XIX, which says that No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.
King s letter argues that, during his time as a prosecutor in Alabama, Mr.
Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens.
It was that portion of the letter that McConnell read back to the presiding officer, arguing that it was over the line.Sen.
Steve Daines (R-Montana) agreed with McConnell, ruling her in violation of the order and forcing her to sit down.
Because of course he did.
I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate, Warren declared.Still yet, Republicans prevailed after a vote was held on Warren s appeal of the ruling of the chair.According to the rules, Warren would be barred from speaking during the remaining 30 hours of the Sessions debate.Even so, Democrats asked that Warren s speaking privileges be restored.Watch:Democrats held the floor for 24 hours to protest Sessions nomination just as they did in advance of Betsy Devos confirmation.
