A Harvard Women s Studies and Islamic Studies professor was forcibly taken off of a Southwest flight today.
She demanded that two dogs be taken off of the plane because she said she s allergic to dogs.
Well, things got ugly as you ll see in the now viral video: You can hear her yell, don t touch me!
at the 1:59 point she says, I m a professor!
WE HAVE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS RED FLAGS EVERYWHERE (see below)!ibloga reported:The woman, identified as 46-year-old Anila Daulatzai from Baltimore, had complained about two dogs on her flight from Baltimore-Washington International Airport to Los Angeles.
She said she was deathly allergic, but when crew informed her they couldn t remove the dogs, one of which was a service dog, she was told to leave the plane.
That s when things went south.
After the woman couldn t show medical papers about her allergies and refused to leave the plane, law enforcement arrived to remove her, Southwest said in a statement.She s since been charged with disorderly conduct, failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order, disturbing the peace, obstructing and hindering a police officer and resisting arrest.We re wondering why you wouldn t carry papers or have some sort of id if you are severely allergic to dogs.
Another reflag is that during her removal by police, the woman said, I need to close my pants .
Hummm She also yells out that her dad has surgery tomorrow.
We re wondering if she is severely allergic to dogs then why didn t she run off the plane away from the dogs to tell someone?
Nothing adds up in this situation we smell a rat but we could be wrong.
We just see red flags everywhere with this woman:WE FOUND THIS ABOUT DAULATZAI:
