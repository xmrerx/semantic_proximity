President Trump just tweeted out a new policy in the US military that was made after consultation with military experts and Generals:Trump made the announcement, which would represent a major shift in military policy, on Twitter.
He said he had made the decision after consulting with my generals and military experts.
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military, Trump tweeted.
Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.
Thank you
