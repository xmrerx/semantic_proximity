san francisco ( reuters ) - california governor jerry brown on friday signed a bill to allow businesses across the state to carry epinephrine auto-injectors , but sharply admonished drugmaker mylan nl over its recent price increases .
mylan has been widely criticized , including by u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton , for raising the price of epipens , which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies .
the company , which acquired the product in 2007 , recently raised the list price for a pair of epipen auto-injectors to $ 600 .
the price has been rising from a cost of about $ 100 in 2008 .
a probe into epipen pricing by a u.s. senate subcommittee was announced on sept. 7 .
brown ’ s decision on friday highlights the predicament facing allergy advocates , who strongly support epinephrine access legislation but have criticized mylan ’ s pricing .
over two dozen u.s. states have passed laws similar to california ’ s authorizing businesses to stock epinephrine , according to advocacy group food allergy research & education .
brown said he was signing the bill because epipens save lives , but that he strongly objected to mylan ’ s pricing .
“ state government can not stop unconscionable price increases , but it can shed light on such rapacious corporate behavior , ” brown said in a statement .
a mylan representative could not immediately be reached for comment .
epipen , which has annual sales of about $ 1 billion , delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions , including to peanuts and bee stings .
mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices .
in response to the furor over pricing , mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of epipen for $ 300 .
