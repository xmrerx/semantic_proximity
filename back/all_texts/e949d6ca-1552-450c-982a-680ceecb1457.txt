The banality of evil is how Ann McElhinney, co-producer of the Gosnell movie describes meeting with serial murderer, Dr. Kermit Gosnell.
In her emotional interview with Dana Loesch, Ann describes her visit as chilling and sitting in the presence of evil.
Ann McElhinney recently interviewed Kermit Gosnell, an abortionist sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder, for a movie she and her husband are making about the man.
She said she couldn t speak for more than an hour after the interview concluded because of how profoundly disturbing the experience was.
He has an answer for everything, McElhinney said on TheBlaze TV s Dana.
He lives in his own world.
Every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie.
He lies so easily.
McElhinney said she has met many criminals throughout her journalistic career, but with Gosnell she said you are really sitting in the presence of evil.
It s almost like all of those literature references to evil and to the devil.
He smiles all the time, McElhinney said, visibly shaken.
He touched my leg.
He was physically inappropriate sat far, far too close in my personal space.
Extremely disturbing.
McElhinney said Gosnell is really happy and relaxed in prison, and started singing twice during the interview in which she asked him about the baby who was born alive during a botched abortion, whose neck he then snipped with a scissors.
I haven t met anyone who chilled my blood to that extent ever before, she concluded.
This man has no sense of guilt.
