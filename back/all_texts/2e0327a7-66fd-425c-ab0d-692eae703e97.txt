Donald Trump pointed out a black person in the crowd at a rally in Redding, CA, and said, Look at my African-American.
Trump s bizarre comment comes a day after Secretary Hillary Clinton eviscerated him in a foreign policy address and labeled him as unfit for the presidency.
Clinton pressed her attack earlier the next day with a release pointing out that Trump literally said all those things after he claimed she had simply made up his strange positions on world affairs.The Clinton campaign noted, Some of the comments she referenced are so ignorant, incoherent or outrageous, it could be hard to believe they actually came out of the mouth of the GOP s presidential nominee.
But they literally did.
It also follows a week in which he was criticized by President Obama, who while not using his name also ripped apart his divisive rhetoric and ideas while touting the economic recovery in Elkhart, Indiana.
Obama said Trump s proposal to roll back regulations on Wall Street was crazy, and that his plan to deport 11 million immigrants was simply a fantasy.
Obama noted, If that is what you are concerned about, the economy, the debate is not even close.
On the same day, Trump doubled down on his criticism of federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case in which former students allege they were swindled out of their money.
Trump repeatedly claimed, in an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper, that the judge could not be impartial because of his Mexican heritage even when he was told that the man is an American citizen born in Indiana.Hillary Clinton responded to Trump s smear of the judge s racial background, pointing out the is a man born in Indiana, which last time I checked was part of America.
Trump s remarks on the judge were rejected by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump for president.Featured image via YouTube
