Texas Senator Ted Cruz refused to endorse Donald Trump during his speaking slot at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, and the hall at the Quicken Loans Arena descended into chaos soon after.While Cruz congratulated Trump on winning the primary, he declined to directly endorse the Republican nominee.
Instead, he told voters to vote their conscience, and the advice was not well received.

Cruz and his campaign often out-maneuvered the incompetent Trump team in its fights for delegates, while Trump used the unusual tactic of re-posting a tweet that attacked Cruz s wife Heidi for her looks.Trump took to calling Cruz Lyin Ted and the two men verbally battled with each other for weeks trading insults and attacks.In response to Cruz s non-endorsement, Trump insiders called him classless according to Fox News.It is widely believed that Cruz is setting himself up to run for president in 2020 after a likely loss by Trump in this year s elections.
While he is unpopular with the Republican establishment who has often criticized him for his outrageous statements and Senate stunts like filibusters that helped to shut the government down, Cruz is popular with the so-called religious right, who calls him one of their own.
His opposition to issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, as well as his strident opposition to diplomacy in the Middle East, helped him win the Iowa Caucus earlier in the year.Featured image via Twitter
