who better than a man who risked the lives of his wife and children to get free dental care to ask taxpayers in europe and america to open their doors to more freeloading muslims ?
the father of a little boy who drowned while fleeing syria has pleaded with the world to open its doors to refugees.three-year-old alan kurdi died along with his mother rehanna and five-year-old brother ghalib in september.they paid cruel people smugglers thousands to reach greece by boat after fleeing their war-ravaged homeland.but pictures of his lifeless body washed up on a turkish beach forced politicians to tackle the refugee crisis.his father abdullah kurdi said : my message is i d like the whole world to open its doors to syrians .
if a person shuts a door in someone s face , this is very difficult .
when a door is opened they no longer feel humiliated .
he added : at this time of year i would like to ask you all to think about the pain of fathers , mothers and children who are seeking peace and security .
we ask just for a little bit of sympathy from you .
