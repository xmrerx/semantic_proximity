london ( reuters ) - britain intends to prevent a hard border in ireland after leaving the european union whatever the outcome of talks with the bloc , uk s brexit minister said on monday , saying comments that this was not legally enforceable were taken out of context .
davis on sunday said that a pledge on the irish border agreed as part of a divorce settlement was a statement of intent rather than a legally binding move , but said the media had twisted his words .
of course it s legally enforceable , under the withdrawal agreement , but even if that didn t for some reason , if something went wrong , we would still be seeking to provide a frictionless , invisible border , davis told lbc radio .
