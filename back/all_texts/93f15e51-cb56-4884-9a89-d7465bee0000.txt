Among all millennials who are likely to vote in the 2016 presidential election, about one-third (34 percent) use Snapchat and nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of millennial Snapchat users are following the campaign closely, the representative said.
The Sanders, Cruz, Kasich, and Paul campaigns have all sponsored Snapchat video or geofilter ads.
