beirut ( reuters ) - syrian president bashar al-assad on monday described u.s.-backed militias in eastern syria as traitors , his office said in an online statement .
in a meeting with russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin at syria s hmeimim base , assad also welcomed a united nations role in syrian elections as long as it was linked with syria s sovereignty , his office cited him as saying .
assad has repeatedly vowed to take back all of syria .
a u.s.-led international coalition against islamic state has given military support to the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias that now controls nearly a quarter of syria .
the sdf said assad s comments were no surprise , accusing his government of sowing strife and sectarianism .
we assert once again that we will go forward without hesitation in chasing terrorism , it said in a statement .
this regime ... is itself a definition of treachery that , if syrians do not confront it , will lead to partitioning the country , which our forces will not allow in any form , the kurdish-led sdf added .
rogozin was quoted by russia s ria news agency as saying after the meeting with assad that russia would be the only country to take part in rebuilding syrian energy facilities .
