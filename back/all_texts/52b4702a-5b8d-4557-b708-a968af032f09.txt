No wonder America loves this guy so much.
It s been a long time since we had a leader who made his enemies look like amateurs After Gawker, an online site released one of Donald Trump s cellphone numbers today.
Gawker claims they released Trump s number because he released the phone number of political opponent and RINO Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).Never one to let a good opportunity go to waste, Trump changed his voicemail to a free campaign announcement for anyone who cares to call his number: Hi, this is Donald Trump and I m running for the presidency of the United States of America, he says on the recording.
With your help and support, together we can make America truly great again!
Visit me at twitter @realDonaldTrump and check out my campaign website at www.donaldtrump.com Hope to see you on the campaign trail, we re going to do it!
Gawker responded by saying: We think it s only fair and right that Republican primary voters be able to reach out to Trump himself.
