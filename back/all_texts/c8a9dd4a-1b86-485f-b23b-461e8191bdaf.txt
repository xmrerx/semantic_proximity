Earlier today, CBS News and other outlets noticed something strange going on behind the White House.
Someone had put up a giant, inflatable chicken that resembled Donald Trump.
Now, the hashtag #TrumpChicken is at the top of Twitter s trending list, and for good reason.So many people find the whole thing hilarious.
It s probably a good thing that Trump isn t actually in the White House to see it right now, although it s a good bet that, if he knows about it, he s fuming.And the popularity of #TrumpChicken on Twitter won t help that.
Not at all.Gotta love a giant #TrumpChicken representing a guy overcompensating for a tiny cock ?Tara Dublin ?
