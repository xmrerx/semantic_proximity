It s good to be worth tens of millions of dollars when you discover you need more than a vagina to win the Democrat nomination Hillary Clinton-aligned Super PAC, Correct the Record, is taking a page out of Vladimir Putin s playbook by employing a $1 million dollar professional internet troll army to build a paid, positive consensus about the Clinton campaign.
The effort, called Breaking Barriers 2016, claims: While Hillary Clinton fights to break down barriers and bring America together, the Barrier Breakers 2016 digital task force will serve as a resource for supporters looking for positive content and push-back to share with their online progressive communities, as well as thanking prominent supporters and committed superdelegates on social media.
Correct The Record will invest more than $1 million into Barrier Breakers 2016 activities, including the more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram.
The campaign will essentially be employing an unknown number of paid, pro-Hillary trolls to spread positive news about the candidate and counter anyone posting negative information about her.
And these aren t just ragtag trolls living in their mothers basements they are industry and campaign professionals.
As Correct the Record acknowledges: The task force staff s backgrounds are as diverse as the community they will be engaging with and include former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers, Ready for Hillary alumni, and Hillary super fans who have led groups similar to those with which the task force will organize.
