There are moments in life when you have to admit you made mistakes.
However, for New Jersey Gov.
Chris Christie, this is not one of those moments.
To be blunt, he s having a very bad week.
Not only is Christie no longer in the running for the White House, he made the bizarre choice to endorse Donald Trump on the same weekend that Trump wouldn t disavow the Ku Klux Klan.
And it even seems as if Trump isn t that thrilled with the support, telling Christie that he should just go home.
Christie claims he s proud to support Trump, but his actions at a recent press conference suggest otherwise.
He insisted that he only be asked questions that were on-topic, and anytime he was asked about Trump he would go off into a rehearsed non-answer to avoid the subject.
He said things, such as: No, I won t permit you to.
I told you that there s going to be only on-topic questions today.
So, permission denied.
That s an off-topic question.
I think you understand that I m answering on-topic questions today.
And then when asked why he wouldn t answer any questions related to Trump, he responded with the maturity level of a four-year-old being asked to eat his peas: Because I don t want to.
At this point the New Jersey governor should just go back to his state to take care of business instead of try to hold on to whatever remaining spotlight he can.
He should do so not only for his state, but also for his dignity.Christie, back away slowly while you still can and do your job.
Both your state and your nation will appreciate it.
Not only does your endorsement mean nothing to Trump, it makes you look like, to use your language, an idiot.Watch the awkward moments from the press conference here:Featured image via screen grab
