A Navy SEAL Carl Higbie was blasted and screeched at by a CNN anchor who was shocked that Higbie asked for more evidence and truth in the Trump controversy.
Yikes!
She s got snowflake written all over her.
It s just how the left rolls you have to march in lock-step with what they believe to be true even if it s not true.
Just go with it, right?
We say NOT RIGHT!Shouldn t we ask that sources be exposed?
Anyone can say they know the truth but when they hide behind anonymity, they ruin their credibility.
The left just expects everyone to believe the many lies they ve been telling about President Trump.
We re with Carl!
We re not accepting any stories against Trump until we have proof and know the source.This woman needs to seek help!
