khartoum ( reuters ) - a 72-year-old swiss aid worker was freed by security forces early on wednesday more than a month after she was abducted in sudan s darfur region , officials said .
margaret schenkel later flew back to the capital khartoum , but did not give details of her ordeal to waiting journalists .
she was kidnapped on oct. 7 in the main city in north darfur region , el fasher , a hub for relief workers and u.n./african union peacekeepers .
security forces launched an operation to free her from a rural area where she was being held outside the southern town of kutum , a spokesman for the regional government said .
the leader and one member of the six-man kidnapping gang had been arrested , sudan s foreign ministry spokesman , qarib al-khidr , said .
neither switzerland nor sudan paid a ransom , he added .
khartoum has been at war with rebel groups in darfur since 2003 , but much of the conflict has descended into banditry and gangs have kidnapped people for ransom .
the swiss foreign ministry thanked sudan for its help in freeing schenkel .
officials have not named her aid group .
