The usual mainstream media suspects are at it again with their fake news reports.
Shameless lefty news outlets made up a false story claiming the Texas SOS Rolando Pablos refused aid for Houston Hurricane Harvey victims and instead asked for prayers.The story spread from one sentence in an article from Canada s CBC News: Pablos declined the aid for now, instead asking for prayers from the people of Quebec,' the article quotes Quebec s International Relations Minister Christine St-Pierre to have said.
He was very touched by the fact we called him.
The CBC has not corrected the lie!
Please send feedback (it took me a minute to do so) to them.
Tell them to correct the lie they told.NOT TRUE!The report by the CBC didn t tell the whole story.
The Texas SOS released a statement with a rebuke to the media reports.
CBC confirmed that they had misreported the interview.
Contrary to what has been reported in the media, Secretary Pablos did not decline the minister s offer, but instead made sure Quebec made contact with the proper Texas state agency, a spokeswoman said.
The Quebec Government s office in Houston is in constant contact with local authorities and is arranging for emergency supplies to be shipped shortly.
Washington Free Beacon reported:Left-wing outlets that reported on the aid denial included The New York Daily News, Raw Story, Salon, and The Root.
Journalists on Twitter spread the story as well, including Texas-based Vanity Fair reporter and MSNBC contributor Kurt Eichenwald.Yes, THAT Kurt Eichenwald!
Remember that he was called out by Tucker Carlson?
Why is he still around?
He gives media a bad name with his yellow journalism!Tucker vs Eichenwald:Why is this guy still working for ANY media outlet?Please view and comment on this MSNBC, Vanity Fair and Newsweek contributor s Twitter feed of angry tweets about President Trump: Kurt Eichenwald Twitter
