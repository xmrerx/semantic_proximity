NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he believed we really have a chance to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough, not least because his administration has yet to articulate a strategy for restarting a moribund peace process.
Trump has described peace between Israelis and Palestinians as the ultimate deal.
Peace between the Palestinians and Israel would be a fantastic achievement, and we are giving it an absolute go.
I think there s a good chance that it could happen.
Most people would say there s no chance whatsoever, Trump said as he began a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York ahead of the U.N. General Assembly s meeting.
I think Israel would like to see it.
I think the Palestinians would like to see it.
I can tell you the Trump administration would like to see it.
So we re working very hard on it; we ll see what happens.
Historically, people say it can t happen.
I say it can happen.
Trump is also to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later this week.
