SPRINGFIELD, Mo.
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Missouri should vote Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill out of office if she does not back his tax cuts.
“We must lower our taxes.
And your senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you and if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to vote her out of office,” Trump said in a speech.
