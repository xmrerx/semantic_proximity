When The Newsroom was canceled almost at the height of its popularity, a hole was left in the world that none have yet filled.
Will McAVoy, the lead character on the show, was fictional but that didn t stop him from becoming one of the most popular news figures in the country.
Clips from the show have repeatedly gone viral, with one video from the first episode of the show going viral repeatedly because of Jeff Daniels character s blunt and honest statements about whether or not America is the greatest country in the world.
People are drawn to McAvoy because he represents something that is missing from American media: someone who is willing to tell the truth no matter what anyone else thinks about it.
The world has missed Will McAVoy, but Daniels resurrected the character so that his beloved character could give his take on the 2016 election.
While Trump is sure to respond by calling Daniels a loser, he tells it like it is.
Bloomberg Television hosts Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ask McAvoy what makes Trump the best-case scenario for Hillary Clinton, but the fictional newscaster (drawing on the energy from the widely-shared greatest country segment) dropped a truth bomb he s not: He s not the best-case scenario, John, that s my answer.
Donald Trump is a fact-bending loose cannon who alienates mainstream voters with everything he says.
But he gets constant media attention for free.
There won t be a day from now until November when Trump isn t on every TV channel.
Sure, she beats Trump in some categories: like millennials, who don t even show up to vote.
She also leads in number of messages deleted on her personal email server, McAvoy continues.
But that aside, when you ask what makes Trump the best-case scenario for Hillary, I don t know what the f*ck you re talking about.
His tiny hands?
