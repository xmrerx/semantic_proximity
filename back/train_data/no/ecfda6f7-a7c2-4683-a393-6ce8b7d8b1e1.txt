brasilia ( reuters ) - brazil s president michel temer warned on friday the country would face economic volatility and loss of international credibility if a bill overhauling its costly social security system is not passed by congress early next year .
speaking to reporters , temer acknowledged that corruption accusations had undermined his popularity and delayed passage of a pension reform bill that is now scheduled to be put to a vote on february 19 .
he said his government would not support a candidate in the 2018 presidential elections that does not back pension reform .
