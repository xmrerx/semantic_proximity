Perhaps Celebrity Cruises didn t get the memo Donald J. Trump won the election.
Trump won the election in large part because people are sick and tired of the unchecked invasion of illegal aliens and refugees from countries who hate us into our country.
Here is the transcript from this insane anti-Trump ad.
Far from the talk of building walls, far from the threats of keeping people out, far from the rhetoric of fear is a world of differences.
Differences that expand and enrich us.
Because after all, our lives aren t made better when we close ourselves off to the world, they re made better when we open ourselves up to it Celebrity Cruises.
If that language sounds targeted to one specific candidate, that s no mistake but it s also not the whole point.
It s in response to the rhetoric around the world, Lisa Lutoff-Perlo, president and CEO of Celebrity Cruises, told Skift.
She named the Brexit vote, the rise of hate crimes in the UK, and the plight of refugees in France as examples.Closest to home for the Miami-based cruise line which gets the majority of its passengers from the United States are the positions that Trump has taken, such as calling for the building of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and for ideological tests to be given to visitors.
If people want to choose [to view] this statement as a political statement, I can t control that, Lutoff-Perlo said.
She said she has thought about whether some potential passengers might be turned off by the spot, but she hasn t worried about the possibility.
I believe anybody that truly looks at this and says, We re not going to sail on Celebrity again, they re probably not sailing on Celebrity, she said.
I hope I get more people than I lose.
Lutoff-Perlo continued: Is there a risk?
Sure.
At some point in time you have to take a stand.
