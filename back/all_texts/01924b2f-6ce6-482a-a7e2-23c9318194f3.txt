WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey told Congress on Sunday a recent review of newly discovered emails did not change the agency’s conclusion reached in July that no charges were warranted in the case of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.
U.S. Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz said in a tweet that Comey had informed him of the conclusion.
Comey’s letter to Congress informing it of the newly discovered emails had thrown Clinton’s presidential race against Republican Donald Trump into turmoil.
