Many people observe Black History Month by learning about important African-American figures in our nation s history or otherwise doing something that isn t horrible then there are Republicans, who have their own ways to celebrate.Donald Trump spent Wednesday hanging out with all the black people he has paid and bribed to like him and having them shower him with compliments.
While treating African-Americans as nothing more than subservient praise machines is, oh, let s just say bad, The Donald s friends on the Senate Judiciary Committee spent the early part of theirconfirming lifelong opponent of civil rights Jeff Sessions day as Attorney General (every Democrat voted against him).Sessions confirmation especially on Wednesday or any day during Black History Month was a slap in the face to African-Americans and all who care about equal rights in this country.
Many have criticized Republicans for their decision to consider Sessions who was once deemed too racist to be a federal judge because he threw the n-word around and liked calling African-Americans boy at all, but the GOP was perfectly happy to push his nomination through.Following Sessions ascension to a post that, to use terms familiar to him, is just below Grand Wizard, Rep. Barbara Lee took to Twitter to put Trump and his GOP Klavern on blast.
Trump says he s honoring #BlackHistoryMonth How?
By nominating Jeff Sessions as AG?
Or by promoting alt-right leader Steve Bannon?
she wrote in one tweet, adding that The Donald is paying lip service to Black History Month while propping up racist Sessions and longtime white supremacist Steve Bannon and their ideas.Trump says he s honoring #BlackHistoryMonth.
How?

Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) February 1, 2017Here s an idea @POTUS : Instead of offering lip service this #BlackHistoryMonth, why not work with @OfficialCBC to end systematic racism?
Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) February 1, 2017 If you truly want to honor Black History Month, she tells Trump, you should start by apologizing to civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis, whom Trump attacked repeatedly for the entire weekend preceding Martin Luther King Day.President Trump: if you truly want to honor #BlackHistoryMonth, you should start by apologizing to civil rights hero @repjohnlewis.
Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) February 1, 2017 On 1st day of #BlackHistoryMonth, GOP Senators on Judiciary voted unanimously for Jeff Sessions AG nomination.
This is a slap in the face, she added.On 1st day of #BlackHistoryMonth, GOP Senators on Judiciary voted unanimously for Jeff Sessions AG nomination.
This is a slap in the face.
Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) February 1, 2017This is a slap in the face to African-Americans, but we can not expect Trump or his GOP cronies to do anything for African-Americans at all, let alone apologize for the attacks on Lewis or fight any kind of racism.
In fact, the man they just confirmed as AG is more likely to continue the GOP s mission of eroding African-Americans civil rights while promoting his and Donald Trump s white supremacist agenda.Featured image via screengrab
