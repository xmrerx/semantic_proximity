the massive shroud of secrecy in muslim communities around the world is what causes people to question the motives of every muslim .
aren t non-violent muslims who say they wouldn t report a terror plot as culpable as the radical muslims who commit acts of terror ?
a new icm poll has discovered two out of three muslims in britain would not give the government any information if they knew details about a terror plot.these disturbing poll results seem to indicate the government s counter-terrorism program , named prevent , is unlikely to provide much usable information on active threats , if it passes along any information at all , the express reports.the results also suggest the existence of a society deep inside britain that is fundamentally opposed to its values and will actively subvert the government to protect its own members .
further questions in the survey revealed even more evidence that muslims diverge entirely from british norms.for example , over 50 percent of muslims think homosexuality should be illegal .
a total of 23 percent of muslims want sharia law to become the dominant legal system in the country .
exactly 31 percent are completely comfortable with one man having multiple wives .
