They were warned by the police on a loudspeaker, but continued to block pedestrians from moving safely along the sidewalk.
This is potentially a very dangerous and threatening situation for visitors to NYC and residents trying to get to and from work in the city.https://twitter.com/Pamela_Moore13/status/859165166092656642NYPD show these Antifa terrorists they re not messing around in this video, as they arrest an Antifa coward burning an American flag.
The Antifa terror group becomes angered after the arrest and start to close in on the officers.
The police handle the situation perfectly and should be commended for addressing these terrorists in such a professional manner.
