Hillary Clinton is pulling out all the stops in her campaign against Donald Trump, and her newest ad is no exception.
It s an infomercial for Trump University, and highlights some of the things various fraud investigations discovered while also quoting testimony from former employees and investigators.
It boils the whole controversy down to the meat and potatoes of the scam, and puts Trump and his university in a very uncomfortable light.It s the maniacally cheerful sarcasm in the narrative that really pulls it all together, though, with gems like: Now, you too can be a source of Trump s wealth with Trump University!
Pay for Trump University at the amazing price of everything you have!
There is no step three!
You won t actually learn anything.
It s that easy!
This is especially good given that Trump claims he s going to reopen Trump University after the lawsuit is over (which he s sure he ll either win, or get tossed out).
And guess what?
He won t just be president of the United States, he ll be president of a university that has fresh, all-new ways of scamming people!Watch the video below.
It really is brilliant.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
