brussels ( reuters ) - a belgian judge made no ruling on friday on a european arrest warrant issued by spain for ousted catalan leader carles puigdemont , his lawyer said after a court hearing in brussels .
the belgian prosecutor demanded the warrant to be exercised , but the case for puigdemont s defense will be made at a hearing early next month .
we will make our case on december 4 .
the prosecutor has asked for the extradition warrant to be exercised .
nothing has been decided today , paul bekaert told reporters outside the main brussels court .
the prosecutor had determined that according to belgian law puigdemont and four of his former ministers who traveled with him to brussels were charged with conspiracy by public officials , bekaert added .
under the spanish warrant , all five faced charges of rebellion and sedition .
they had left spain after puigdemont s regional government was sacked by madrid for unilaterally declaring catalonia independent following a referendum on secession that court authorities in madrid had ruled was illegal .
the european arrest warrant system in place since 2004 makes it easier for eu countries to demand the extradition from other eu states of people wanted for crimes , and removes political decision-making from the process .
eu countries issue thousands of such warrants each year .
the oct. 1 referendum and subsequent turmoil have plunged spain into its gravest political crisis since the return of democracy four decades ago .
puigdemont has since said he might consider a solution that did not involve secession .
