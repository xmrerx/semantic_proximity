dubai ( reuters ) - the saudi-led coalition fighting in yemen said on saturday it was confident that leaders of former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh s general people s congress party ( gpc ) would return to the arab fold .
the comments , carried by the saudi-owned al-hadath news channel , came after saleh said he was ready to turn a new page with the coalition if it stopped what he described as its aggression on yemen and lifted restrictions on transportation .
the coalition accuses saleh of having betrayed his arab neighbors by joining the houthi-led forces they say are aligned with non-arab iran .
