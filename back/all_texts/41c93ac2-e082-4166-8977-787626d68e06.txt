Cher is a legend among pop singers.
She is also no fan of Donald Trump.
The gorgeous pop diva has fully endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and is now hitting the campaign trail to make sure that Clinton defeats the racist, bigoted demagogue that the Republicans have nominated.
In her latest attack, Cher appeared at a Clinton event in Provincetown, Massachusetts and issues a blistering indictment of Donald Trump.
She said: I just think he s a f ing idiot.
Cher was just getting started with that one, though.
She went on to say that Trump s Make America Great Again campaign slogan is what we all know it to be: coded language to bring back the times when straight, white, Christians ruled all and women stayed in their place, saying He means we want to make America straight and white.
Truer words were never spoken with regards to Trump s travesty of a presidential run, but Cher wasn t done yet.
She continued: He just says like the weirdest sh-t. And also, I love this, he s like L-G-B-T and Q?
Like he just learned it, you know?
Cher went on to invoke Fun with Dick and Jane, a throwback series from the 1970s: It s like Racist Fun with Dick and Jane.
We re going to build walls!
After that, Cher turned her sights to praising Hillary Clinton, and again warning of the dangers of Trump: I believe in her so much, Cher said, referring to Clinton.
I know that if he got into office, our world would be the worst place, Cher said.
I don t think we could imagine how bad it could get.
If breaking news ever happened and he had to go to the podium, we would just all go f k. She s right, of course.
As an American who takes pride in and loves my country, I really, really hope that this scenario never comes to life.Watch the epic remarks below:Featured image via Cher Twitter
