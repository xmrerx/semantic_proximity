johannesburg ( reuters ) - south african president jacob zuma on tuesday asked the high court to set aside a report by the anti-corruption watchdog on alleged influence-peddling in his government , saying he would instead set up a commission of inquiry into the allegations .
the court has been hearing a case brought by zuma who had challenged the right of the report s author , south africa s anti-graft agency known as public protector , to call for a judicial inquiry to investigate the allegations .
zuma , 75 , who previously described the state of capture report as unfair in parliament , said setting up such an inquiry was his prerogative .
the report published a year ago recommended a judicial investigation into allegations of systemic corruption by zuma , some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies .
the report focused on allegations that zuma s friends , the businessmen and brothers ajay , atul and rajesh gupta , had influenced the appointment of ministers .
zuma and the guptas have denied the accusations .
in a fresh application on tuesday , zuma s lawyers argued that the entire report by former public protector head thuli madonsela should be set aside .
should the court grant his application , zuma would set up a separate commission of inquiry himself within 30 days of the date of the order , court papers presented by his lawyers said .
the main opposition democratic alliance party opposes zuma s application , saying it is unconstitutional .
it says it wants the court to support madonsela s recommendation for a judicial inquiry .
