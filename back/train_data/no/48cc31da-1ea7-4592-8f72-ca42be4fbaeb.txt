thanks to our government , the land of opportunity has taken on a whole new meaning an immigrant cabby scored the deal of a lifetime a chelsea pad for free until he dies thanks to an obscure provision in the city s rent-stabilization law.tlc-licensed driver oltimdje ouattara hit the apartment jackpot after he began renting a room for $ 48 a night at an illegal hostel called the chelsea highline hotel at 184 11th ave. in august.ouattara learned that since the building was registered with the city for single-room occupancy , he just had to submit a written request to become a permanent tenant there and his rent would be locked in for life.it s the same legal loophole that had been used by five other hacks in the building before him .
as the post has exclusively reported , the other cabbies landed deals requiring them to pay around $ 300 a month for apartments that can go for up to $ 3,200.but ouattara was able to net an even sweeter deal allowing him to pay absolutely nothing because the official listed rate on his illegal room was $ 0 .
and a judge said that s what the rent for his assigned room , no .
201 , would stay.ouattara has been sharing a one-room apartment in the bronx with five other people since the hostel manager locked him out.manhattan housing court justice sabrina kraus appeared to be furious at the chelsea landlord .
she said the landlord should have been well aware of [ his ] obligations because he had lost a nearly identical case brought by ouattara s neighbor , hamidou guira , weeks earlier.ouattara managed to slip his lease request in just before building owner chelsea skybox llc closed down the hostel , ensuring others can t follow suit.lawyers for chelsea skybox llc , which is controlled by israeli developer john leitersdorf and his partner , john jacobsen , did not return messages seeking comment.but they have filed a lawsuit against ouattara , the city and the state , claiming the housing laws are unconstitutional and tantamount to taking property without due process .
