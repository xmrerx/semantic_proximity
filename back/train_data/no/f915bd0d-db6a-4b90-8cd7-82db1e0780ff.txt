buenos aires ( reuters ) - argentina s top prosecutor quit on monday under pressure from the government over accusations that she hampered corruption investigations into officials from the previous administration of president cristina fernandez .
alejandra gils carbo , whose resignation will take effect on dec. 31 , was appointed chief prosecutor during populist fernandez s second term and stayed in the post under business-oriented president mauricio macri .
macri , in office since late 2015 , accused gils carbo of failing to bring corruption charges against members of fernandez s cabinet .
gils carbo is herself the focus of a corruption investigation cantering on her tenure as lead prosecutor .
she has denied corruption allegations .
at a press conference in july , macri described gils carbo as a political activist who misused her power as attorney general .
after repeatedly calling for her resignation , macri s government began a campaign for reforms that would allow for gils carbo s firing , which ultimately prompted her to step down .
in her resignation letter , gils carbo told macri she was concerned that his actions would end up hurting state institutions by significantly affecting the autonomy of the public prosecutor s office .
gils carbo resigned one week after a powerful minister from the fernandez era was arrested following a vote in congress that stripped him of his parliamentary immunity in two corruption cases .
the former minister , julio de vido , is the most powerful official from the fernandez administration to be jailed .
macri s coalition was empowered by midterm elections on oct. 22 , and he has pledged more reforms .
