Donald Trump is clearly enamored with fascism and bigotry.
Since he came on the scene as an unlikely presidential contender by calling Mexicans rapists and promising to build a wall along our southern border, people all over the world have been comparing him to Hitler.
This has only increased as he has rolled out one bigoted policy after another.
During his campaign, he continuously retweeted white supremacists and then hired Steve Bannon as his number one advisor.So, how do you know when the comparisons between Trump and Hitler are just hyperbole and when to take these concerns seriously?
