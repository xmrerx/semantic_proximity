naveed jamali is supposed to be a professional analyst on msnbc but we re guessing that s just too much to ask of these news hacks .
he makes the claim that jared kushner is a double agent for the russians !
he goes on to make claims about others in the trump administration with zero evidence !
to say this is way past crazy is an understatement !
the liberal media must have all gotten their orders to saturate the airwaves with horrible lies about trump s inner circle .
this is dangerous stuff because there is no evidence at all but people will come away with a tainted view of kushner no matter what happens.jamali : you look for patterns and this is a clear pattern emerging .
it s a pattern that shows a consistent effort to deceive .
and when you have that , there s only one conclusion you can draw , again from an intelligence standpoint that this man ( jared kushner ) was either a russian agent , either aspiring to be a russian agent or was in fact a russian agent.ruhle : hold on , this man being jared kushner ?
you really think he wants to be a russian agent ?
why would he be a russian agent ?
that s a major allegation .
i mean that s kind of a stretch , this is bonkers !
