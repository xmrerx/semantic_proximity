vickie paladino and her husband were driving through their neighborhood when they spotted the mayor .
paladino was so upset over de blasio s trip to germany to speak at a g-20 protest in lieu of attending a vigil for slain new york police officer miosotis familia that she left the car to berate him.as de blasio approached her and a group of others to shake hands , she started to ask about his trip .
he turned around with his security detail and went to his car .
i want to know why you let your police officers down and our country down by going to germany and protesting against our country , she yelled at de blasio .
i want to know why you re doing that .
ok ?
i don t care about the trees .
we ll work it out .
advertisingcbs reporter marcia kramer had a scathing assessment of de blasio , who she said simply fled when paladino started her criticism .
the woman in the white shirt single-handedly brought wrestlemania to the streets of whitestone , queens , but her opponent bill de blasio was no hulk hogan or the rock , kramer said .
he was more like the cowardly lion in the wizard of oz .
paladino caught the attention of the media assembled for the event , and she told reporters that she d had it with de blasio and doubted he had a friend in the city .
this is got to do with a liberal , socialist mayor who is running our city and has no regard for our country , she said .
why did you go to germany ?
why did you stand with the communists , with the anarchists , with the socialists when you re supposed to be here , taking care of our business , our police officers , she said in a later interview with kramer .
