last week , raba research had hillary clinton beating donald trump in a general election match-up by 15 points , gaining 10 points on the gop presidential candidate after a strong showing at the democratic national convention.raba s poll was considered a complete outlier , given most other polls ( whether they be from reuters , cnn , fox , ipsos ) had clinton beating trump by 6 to 10 points.but now a second poll has come out that may put raba back into the mainstream.a mcclatchy-marist poll has given hillary clinton a 15 point lead over donald trump ( 48-33 ) , and a 14 point lead when factoring in third party candidates ( 45-31 ) .
so even with spoilers , clinton blows trump out of the water.what s even more fascinating is the mcclatchy-marist poll shows clinton with an 8 point lead among men , and a 23 point lead among those who identify as moderates .
clinton is also viewed as more presidential than trump by 14 points ( 53-39 ) .when it comes to who can best handle the war on terror , immigration , gun violence , trade and jobs , clinton bests trump in every category , by a margin of 4-21 points.while clinton gained in democratic support , going from 83 percent to 90 percent , trump lost among republicans , going from 85 percent to 79 percent.so jill stein isn t siphoning off clinton supporters , but it would appear gary johnson may be gaining with trump supporters .
i guess those in the never trump camp are aplenty while those in the never hillary are almost non-existent.wasn t trump supposed to be the great unifier ?
he s losing members of his own party , and quickly ( remember , the rnc was only two weeks ago ) .in fact , 57 percent of people voting for clinton are voting for her , more or less , because of her , whereas 40 percent are doing it to spite trump .
on the other side , only 36 percent of trump supporters are voting for the billionaire because they like him , while 57 are voting for him to spite clinton.so trump s voters don t really like him all that much .
clinton s voters ?
they sure do.this poll is not an outlier .
it s the second one showing secretary clinton with a monumental lead .
as trump continues into the abyss , clinton is truly making the sky her limit.this will only pay off if democrats and progressives alike get out and vote.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images
