a few weeks ago , pepsi decided to try to bridge the racial divide with what someone must have thought was a great idea .
they ran an ad featuring kendall jenner , who , in the ad , tried to show police and african-americans that their lives matter by letting a cop drink pepsi.here it is : the internet hated it ( which might have been the point ) : within 48 hours the video got nearly 1.6 million views on youtube ( five times as many downvotes as upvotes ) , and twitter and facebook lit up with people pointing out just how gauche the whole thing was .
activist deray mckesson called it trash , adding if i had carried pepsi i guess i never would ve gotten arrested .
who knew ?
people made memes ( some even reaching back and evoking pepper spray cop ) .
and , rightfully , many folks pointed out that using protest imagery in order to peddle soda particularly images that evoked the photo of ieshia evans facing down police in baton rouge , louisiana last year was pretty tasteless .
it was one of the few times the internet ever agreed on anything.source : wiredwhether in response to pepsi s ad that never should have been , or whether this began organically , heineken beer had their own version of an ad that addresses the political divide , but they got it right.in an experiment , they had complete strangers who would hate each other under normal circumstances , and put them in situations that created bonding .
guess how it ends .
here it is : it won the internet .. @ heineken just dropped an ad that actually brings people together pepsi , take note # openyourworld https : //t.co/e72swzqqp6 hayley jones ( @ meetmissjoness ) april 27 , 2017brilliant .
