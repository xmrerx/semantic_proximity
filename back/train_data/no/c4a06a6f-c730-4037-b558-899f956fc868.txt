hillary clinton matched president obama s historically low percentage of the jewish vote , driving a third of jews into the republican camp , an unheard of percentage before obama s pro-iran policies .
obama also turned jews off by his blatant personal antipathy to israel s prime minister , so the question was whether jews would come back as a voting bloc for clinton , who is thought of as a friend to israel by many jews , merely by association with her husband.the answer is no , jews did not return to the democratic fold.the retired democratic jews of florida were a crucial demographic clinton had to carry , and she didn t , according to lori lowenthal marcus , co-founder of jewschoosetrump.org.experienced political strategist dan rodriguez , founder and ceo of the mgr group , spent the run-up to election day and the big day itself in florida .
in the aftermath of the election , he has been traveling to boards of elections in heavily jewish voting districts .
he explained that from raw data , jewish votes are difficult to distinguish because they get lumped in with white votes .
yet clinton received only 32 percent of the white votes ( into which jewish votes are lumped ) in miami-dade [ county ] , whereas obama took 37 percent , rodriguez told me .
in addition , he said , voters 45 or older , a significant portion of whom are jewish , went strongly for trump , 56 percent to clinton s 42 percent .
trump also won the support of passionately pro-israel las vegas casino magnate sheldon adelson , who may have donated more than $ 75 million to fuel a much needed ad campaign , which ran on all the sports channels and elsewhere in the final two weeks before the election .
