Late Night host Seth Myers had a fun segment recently, pointing out the blatant support presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has received from racist white supremacists.
Myers used a segment on his NBC talk show to lay out the fact that Trump s racist support hasn t just been a one-off, but in fact has been a series of the worst people imaginable backing the candidate.Myers discusses William Johnson, who was selected and approved by the Trump campaign as a delegate from California to go to the convention, even though he is a public white nationalist and paid for robocalls on Trump s behalf.
In those robocalls, Johnson said Trump was a candidate who would defend against so-called white genocide.
After the controversy blew up, Johnson resigned his position.Another Trump backer profiled by Myers is a KKK Grand Dragon who got caught pretending to be a Clinton supporter, but instead had a history of writing online promoting Trump and attacking Democrats.Myers also used his video to point out how incompetent the Trump campaign has been in responding to the negative press from these incidents, and despite Trump s claim to be a smooth operator, he is more likely to build a wall surrounding New Mexico than he is to build his beloved border wall in the south.The conservative movement has historically had problems with white supremacists, as they are torn by the need to pander to those voters who often exist in their base and the desire to distance themselves publicly from racist speech and actions.
At the same time, that same Republican Party works in the states on laws singled out by civil rights organizations as blatantly designed to suppress the black and latino votes, and also often dismisses the concerns of protests like black lives matter, instead choosing to ally themselves with odious figures like George Zimmerman.Featured image via YouTube
