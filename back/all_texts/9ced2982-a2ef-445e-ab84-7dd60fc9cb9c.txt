Mitch McConnell just made a statement on the Senate floor that the Senate will follow the Biden rule and wait until a new administration comes in to consider a Supreme Court nominee.
McConnell made the case that the Senate has the right to do this and that it s not against Judge Garland.
Garland is a liberal judge but not as left leaning as some who were considered for the nomination on the Supreme Court.
In fact, Orin Hatch of Utah was quoted as saying Garland would be a good choice.
Obama must have called his bluff on this one.
The Senate s not biting and will stick to its guns or risk even more criticism from Republicans.CSPAN VIDEO: MCCONNELL STATEMENT
