paris ( reuters ) - france reacted cautiously on friday to u.s. evidence which allegedly proved iran supplied weapons to houthi militia in yemen , saying it was still studying information at its disposal and the united nations had yet to draw any conclusions .
the united states on thursday presented for the first time pieces of what it said were iranian weapons supplied to the houthis , describing it as conclusive evidence that tehran was violating u.n. resolutions .
the arms included charred remnants of what the pentagon said was an iranian-made short-range ballistic missile fired from yemen on nov. 4 at king khaled international airport outside saudi arabia s capital riyadh , as well as a drone and an anti-tank weapon recovered in yemen by the saudis .
when asked whether paris believed that evidence was irrefutable , foreign ministry deputy spokesman alexandre giorgini declined to respond directly .
the united nations secretariat has not , at this stage , drawn any conclusions .
france continues to examine the information at its disposal , he said .
tensions between iran and france have increased in recent weeks after president emmanuel macron said tehran should be less aggressive in the region and clarify its ballistic missile program .
giorgini said france remained concerned by iran s ballistic missile program and urged it to abide fully by u.n. security council resolution 2231 .
resolution 2231 , which enshrined the landmark nuclear deal with world powers , calls on iran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs , including launches using such technology .
it stops short of explicitly barring such activity .
france s foreign minister is due in washington on monday to in part to discuss iran and will travel to tehran at the start of january .
