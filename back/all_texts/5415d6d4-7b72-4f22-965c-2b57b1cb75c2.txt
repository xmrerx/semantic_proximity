Reality show star turned so-called president Donald Trump alleged in a tweetstorm this morning that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower s wires tapped before the election.
The only place Trump could have gotten that disinformation is from fake news site Breitbart.com.
Trump has some splainin to do over that conspiratorial tweet.
Like, for example, what the f*ck he s talking about.
For sure, former President Barack Obama has no idea what Trump what Trump is referring to.Trump called Obama bad or sick during his tweet frenzy, all while offering no proof to back up his jaw-dropping claims.Rep.
Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is also probing the scope of Russia s influence on the US election, said in a statement Saturday afternoon in regards to one of Trump s tweets this morning, If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them.
No matter how much we hope and pray that this President will grow into one who respects and understands the Constitution, separation of powers, role of a free press, responsibilities as the leader of the free world, or demonstrates even the most basic regard for the truth, we must now accept that President Trump will never become that man, Schiff said.Trump s baseless accusations backfired.
Now Democrats want an investigation.Don't be distracted by Trump & his lunatic rants.
We need an independent investigation into #Trumprussia now.

Mr. President: If there was a wiretap at Trump Tower, that means a fed judge found probable cause of crime which means you are in deep shit.
https://t.co/i7dUMtHXmo Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 4, 2017The info apparently came from President Steve Bannon s man-cave, Breitbart.com.POTUS cited no evidence though he has access to intel reports to confirm, it appears to have come from Breitbart: https://t.co/WVFXOYo9K2 https://t.co/TXmGxT2Lrv Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) March 4, 2017 What is he hiding?
Trump has been caught in lie after lie.
Do not be distracted.
Trump's campaign/associates did communicate w/ Russia.
What is he hiding?

You're the president of the United States.
Start acting like it.Sincerely,America https://t.co/Zgfp758DUf Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) March 4, 2017You're not credible.
https://t.co/L5wHDvJ7rQ Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) March 4, 2017Trump is now considered a joke.Aaaaaaaand, we're back!
https://t.co/me5r4e8HeJ Jim Himes (@jahimes) March 4, 2017Lawmakers are finding themselves in a position to tell Trump how to president.1/ The President can't "order" a wiretap.
They are ordered by a judge if there is 1) possible crime, or 2) possible foreign agent involved.
Jim Himes (@jahimes) March 4, 20172/ So @realDonaldTrump is either lying, or he declassifed a judicial warrant possibly targeting him.
I think we need to know which it is.
Jim Himes (@jahimes) March 4, 2017It s not just Democrats.
GOP Sen. Ben Sasse said on Saturday that Trump owes the public a further explanation of his bizarre allegation against Obama.
The president today made some very serious allegations, and the informed citizens that a republic requires deserve more information, Sasse said, according to Politico.
If without [an authorization], the President should explain what sort of wiretap it was and how he knows this.
It is possible that he was illegally tapped.
But Sasse added that there are legalities to a wiretap.
If it was with a legal FISA court order, then an application for surveillance exists that the court found credible.
The president should ask that this full application regarding surveillance of foreign operatives or operations be made available, ideally to the full public, and at a bare minimum to the U.S. Senate, Sasse said.Maybe if Trump released his tax returns, we could learn more.
