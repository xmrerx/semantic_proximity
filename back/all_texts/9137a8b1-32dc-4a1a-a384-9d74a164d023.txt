Being a xenophobic bigot and a confirmed fascist wasn t enough for Donald Trump.
He had to go and involve the children.
These unfortunate little girls now get to go the rest of their lives knowing they sang a song of hate and fear in support of a man who embodies the absolute worst America has to offer.It may have been one thing had the song been a cute little ditty about Trump and his family or a generic and non-offensive tune about America, but it s not.
It s a song of pure hate, with lyrics that can be described as nothing but stupid:CowardiceAre you serious?Apologies for freedom, I can t handle this.When freedom rings, answer the call!On your feet, stand up tall!Freedom s on our shoulders, USA!Enemies of freedom face the music, c mon boys, take them downPresident Donald Trump knows how to make America greatDeal from strength or get crushed every timeFace the music?
Take them down?
Get crushed every time?
Seriously?
The main problem is, while this asinine song may seem like it s about America s enemies, it s actually about America itself.
Trump may well be looking to destroy our enemies abroad, but from the actions of he and his supporters at their rallies, the meaning couldn t be more clear: Stand in Trump s way and pay the price, no matter who you are.We ve seen his fascism in his platform.
Registering American Muslims and refusing entry to all others into the country.
No cure for immigration: deport them all.
Build a wall; keep them out.
If they dissent, silence them.
These are the things we gasp at when we hear, knowing how much support this new age Hitler has.
The press are tossed from his rallies for not focusing their cameras exclusively on him.
He stops every five minutes when he speaks to encourage the mob mentality and have someone thrown out.This man is nothing but dangerous and because of that these poor girls won t soon be forgotten.Featured image via screen capture
