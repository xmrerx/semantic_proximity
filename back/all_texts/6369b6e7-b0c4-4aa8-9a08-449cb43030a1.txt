Another day, another Trump supporter commits an atrocity, weakening America s morale one by one.
This time, it s a double whammy Trump supporters who happen to be members of the Ku Klux Klan.William Hagen, grand dragon of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (who organized a White Lives Matter rally), and Klan leader Chris Barker, were arrested in North Carolina after the two stabbed another Klansman, who eventually escaped with wounds to the chest.According to the New York Times:The attack took place hours before a Ku Klux Klan parade on Saturday in Roxboro, N.C., billed as a celebration of Mr. Trump s victory Mr. Hagen was in North Carolina to attend that parade, the authorities said.
Mr. Barker was arrested before the parade, and Mr. Hagen after, during a traffic stop, Captain Rose said.Hagen was charged with attempted murder and Barker was charged with aiding and abetting an assault.So far, no motive or reason has been released as to why the stabbing took place.
But when it comes to the insanity of the reasoning used by Klansmen to justify violence, does it really matter?
Since the rise (and election) of Donald Trump, violence and white nationalism not coincidentally has been on a rise in the United States.
Today in North Carolina, the two came head-to-head.The victim, Richard Dillon, is being treated for his injuries and his attackers are being held without bail.Once again, the question needs to be asked: is Donald Trump going to denounce this kind of behavior?
These men supported him, organized a rally in his honor, and voted for him.
They ve been in the news as organizers for his campaigns, and now they have unsuccessfully tried to murder another human being (albeit one with deplorable qualities).The violence, hatred, and deplorabiltiy continues under Donald Trump, who gave new purpose to worst drudges of society.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images
