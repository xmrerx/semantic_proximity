As was reported earlier, statues of a naked Donald Trump have been appearing all over the country.The artists that put them up had this to say about the installations: It is through these sculptures that we leave behind the physical and metaphorical embodiment of the ghastly soul of one of America s most infamous and reviled politicians.
Ain t that the truth, and interestingly enough, their depiction of the real estate mogul/reality television star/egomaniac is likely remarkably lifelike.Take a look at the sculpture as it was in New York City s Union Square earlier on Thursday:s/o to whoever installed this Trump statue in Union Square last night pic.twitter.com/Cldd4qkgyI JamesMichael Nichols (@jamesmichael) August 18, 2016Clearly kinda sorta inappropriate, yet still very entertaining and hilarious.However, knowing it really couldn t stay where it was, New York City s Parks and Recreation Department issued this hilarious statement: NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small.

HA!Now, one could say this sort of remark from a city s Parks and Rec.
department and especially from the city where Trump is from, is kind of a slap in the face.
However, with Trump s clear narcissism, need for constant attention, and always talking how his plans are the biggest and the best, it s pretty obvious he s overcompensating for something.
What that something is, who s to know, but the artists of this installation seem to have a pretty good idea.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images
