jakarta ( reuters ) - indonesian police shot dead two men suspected of burning down a police station complex in a jihadist-inspired attack after they fired at them with bows and arrows , officials said on monday .
all the main buildings at the police headquarters in dharmasraya regency in west sumatra were burned to the ground in sunday s attack .
there were no casualties .
we are investigating links between the fire and the two terrorists who were killed , said national police spokesman rikwanto , adding that a jihadist message was found scrawled on a piece of paper on one of the suspects .
he added that firefighters had found two suspects near the complex and reported them to police .
the suspects tried to shoot at police with bows and arrows and were shot dead .
police and police buildings have been the primary targets for militants in indonesia for many years , because of a sustained crackdown by the anti-terrorism force on home-grown radicals .
detachment 88 - known locally as densus 88 - has managed to stamp out or weaken many radical islamist networks .
but the world s largest muslim-majority nation has seen a recent resurgence in radicalism , inspired largely by islamic state .
a series of small-scale attacks since early 2016 have been linked to islamic state , which is believed to have thousands of sympathizers in indonesia .
