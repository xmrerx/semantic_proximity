kiev/chisinau ( reuters ) - moldova recalled its ambassador to russia for consultations in response to the harassment and intimidation by russian authorities of moldovan politicians and officials , the moldovan foreign ministry said on monday .
moldova and russia have been embroiled in a series of rows this year , including tit-for-tat expulsions of each other s diplomats in may and moldova declaring the russian deputy prime minister persona non grata in august .
the chisinau government says its officials are being mistreated partly to derail a moldovan investigation into an alleged russian-led money laundering operation .
russia has accused moldova of some openly anti-russian actions .
in announcing the ambassador s recall , the moldovan foreign ministry said in a statement on its website : we will look for ways to overcome the current situation so that in the future such actions are avoided , which can spoil moldovan-russian relations , which the moldovan side wants to be friendly , trusting and based on respect for each other .
ex-soviet moldova is politically divided between a pro-western government , which favors closer integration with the european union , and russian-backed president igor dodon .
in december the head of moldova s ruling party , vlad plahotniuc , accused russian authorities of harassing him and other officials with dozens of bogus legal cases intended to put him on international law enforcement watch lists .
