a german artist is in a whole heap of trouble .
is this artist so oblivious to how muslims feel about this ?
she says it s funny .
yikes !
run for the hills lady ! despite describing her latest work as being apolitical , munich-based artist beate passow was busy courting controversy in berlin , tuesday , displaying her bare-legged burka-barbies .the dolls are robed in vibrant , rainbow coloured burkas , but passow has chosen to remove the modesty of the full body veil , and show her figurines in mini-skirts with uncovered legs.yeah , real funny our previous report on burka s in germany : angela merkel running for re-election makes stunning announcement to ban burkas , after flooding nation with 2 million ( mostly muslim ) migrantsangela merkel today completed an astonishing u-turn as she formally endorsed a full burka ban following a backlash over her open-door migration policies.the german chancellor made the comments at a christian democratic union ( cdu ) conference having recently declared she will seek re-election.she told the annual congress that it was legitimate to expect integration from newcomers , underlining her party s bid to ban the full face veil .
the full veil must be banned wherever it is legally possible , she said to a large round of applause.merkel also stressed her determination to ensure that there s no repeat of last year s huge migrant influx as she seeks a new two-year term in charge of her conservative party .
sun ukan official within the ruling cdu/csu coalition said regional states have to obey the law and warned those who didn t would lose funding.this comes in spite of german chancellor angela merkel s long-standing open-door migrant policy , which began last year and has seen more than one million migrants enter the country since.the country is now home to more than 200,000 failed asylum seekers , who continue to live in germany despite officials confirming they would be at no risk if they were forced to go back to their home countries .
