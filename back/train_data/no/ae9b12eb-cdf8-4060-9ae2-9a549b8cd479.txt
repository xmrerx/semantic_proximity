i watched this exchange last night and couldn t believe the insanity seriously .
it was curfew and the people in the streets ignored it which is crazy in itself but then geraldo shows up .
he almost comes to blows with rioters and is screamed at .
one rioter said , stop making money off of black pain .
the part of all this that s maddening is this woman s excuse that the media was causing these people to be angry .
the city council woman continued to make excuses for these bad actors and blamed the messenger .
does this sound familiar to anyone ?
yes , this is the common theme from the left and i believe most americans are 100 % fed up !
with it .
