london ( reuters ) - the european union agreed that britain would not have to come up with a figure for a financial deal to leave the bloc before moving talks on to discuss a trade deal , brexit minister david davis said on sunday .
speaking to sky news , davis said britain agreed to the sequencing of talks demanded by the eu but had told the bloc s negotiators it would not come up with a figure to push them beyond phase one .
we said : alright .
we ll do this sequencing , but don t imagine you will have a number or a formula ( for the financial settlement ) at the end of it .
we ll get towards that process but you won t have a number or a formula before we move on to the next stage .
