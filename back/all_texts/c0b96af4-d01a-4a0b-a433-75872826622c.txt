It s been two days since the Secret Service determined that there was no assassination attempt on Donald Trump s life, yet conservatives continue to harp about it.On Saturday night in Reno, an anti-Trump Republican attempted to hold up a sign.
Trump supporters immediately surrounded the man.
Someone in the crowd yelled gun and that was the excuse used to beat up the man until Secret Service intervened.
Trump was rushed off stage.The man was quickly released after no gun was found and it became clear that there was never an assassination attempt.Let s repeat that.
There was NO assassination attempt and this information has been available since early Sunday morning.
But that hasn t stopped conservatives from posting about it as if Trump somehow heroically survived an attempt on his life.Not only did Bristol Palin post such bullshit on Sunday morning hours after the Secret Service made their determination, conservative white grievance host Tomi Lahren did the same thing on Monday morning.Trump finishes rally after assassination scare.
Hillary faints in 76 degree weather.
You decide who has the stamina & fearlessness to lead!
Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) November 7, 2016And like Palin, Lahren got her ass handed to her on Twitter for it.
@TomiLahren nobody was trying to kill him.
