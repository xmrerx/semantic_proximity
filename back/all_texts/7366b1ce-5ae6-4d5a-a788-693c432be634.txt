With Donald Trump handing out nicknames left and right, one nickname that has come to mind for him would be Hypocrite Trump.
First of all, he doesn t apparently realize that the internet can document the things you say for years after you say them.
Secondly, he also doesn t seem to realize that those things that he said can and will come back to haunt him.For instance, back in 2012, Trump, on top of previously requesting President Obama s birth certificate, also demanded that he release his college transcripts.Trump tweeted out on October 30, 2012, only days before the 2012 presidential election: Why does Obama believe he shouldn t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition?
Hiding something?

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2012And of course President Obama wasn t hiding anything, and Trump was just trying to stir up trouble to make people believe the president was up to no good.Now, flash forward to today and Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Documents that every presidential candidate releases to show the nation financial transparency.
Of course, Trump has lame excuse after lame excuse as to why he can t release them.
All of which have been debunked.So, please, by all means, let s remind Trump of his blaring hypocrisy.
Clearly, according to himself, he s hiding something.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Twitter
