on thursday , donald trump hopped on the twitter machine and made a promise to all americans , tweeting out a graphic posted on his instagram account : my administration will follow two simple rules : buy american and hire american !
# usaa photo posted by donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) on dec 29 , 2016 at 6:52am psttrump must have a very short memory because during the campaign it was revealed that his suits and ties , as well as a number of other products , are made in china ( that s the country the donald has been going out of his way to provoke as of late ) or other countries .
he appears to be blissfully unaware of his own long and storied history of hiring mexican and other foreign workers .
he also seems to be ignoring or somehow oblivious to the fact that his daughter , incoming first lady ivanka , was recently busted manufacturing her clothing in china , indonesia , and vietnam and the fact that his presidency was made in russia.while the trumps will say this is part of their mission to make america great again , twitter jumped on the president- elect for his hypocrisy : .
@ realdonaldtrump you have frequently hired foreign guest workers to fill jobs that could be completed by americans https : //t.co/vhfe3nqnaf lauren duca ( @ laurenduca ) december 29 , 2016 .
@ realdonaldtrump great slogan , sweetie !
nobody sells like my donny !
but being the architect of viable policy should be a bit more nuanced .

pic.twitter.com/d14wz4hrrw dusty ( @ dustingiebel ) december 29 , 2016trump seems to be incapable of telling the truth at this point , and his own love of exploiting foreign labor is well-documented .
unfortunately , the donald s inbred , meth-addled fans are exactly the level of stupid required to fall for trump s buy american , hire american line of bullsh * t.featured image via getty images ( win mcnamee ) /screengrab
