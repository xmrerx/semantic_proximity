WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s new immigration order will remove Iraq from the list of countries whose citizens face a temporary U.S. travel ban, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed U.S. officials.
Four officials say the decision follows pressure from the Pentagon and State Department, the AP reported.
They had urged the White House to reconsider Iraq’s inclusion given its key role in fighting the Islamic State group, it added.
Trump is expected to sign the new order on Wednesday.
An earlier order was blocked by federal courts.
