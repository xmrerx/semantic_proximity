belfast ( reuters ) - a leader of a british far-right group , whose anti-islamic posts were retweeted by u.s. president donald trump causing outrage in britain , was arrested in northern ireland on thursday minutes after being bailed over a separate incident .
jayda fransen , deputy leader of the fringe anti-immigrant britain first group , appeared at a court in belfast to face charges of using threatening , abusive or insulting words in a speech at a rally in the city in august .
she was remanded on continuing bail until january 9 on condition that she does not go within 500 meters of any rally or demonstration before the case is finished .
as she left court , fransen , 31 , was then arrested and charged with breaking the same law in a separate incident on wednesday near one of the peace walls that separate catholic and protestant neighborhoods , police said .
police declined to give any further details of the incident .
britain first s leader paul golding , 35 , was also arrested as he accompanied fransen to the courthouse and later charged in connection with the august incident .
trump s sharing of fransen s anti-muslim videos , posted on twitter , provoked outrage in britain last month , drawing a sharp rebuke from prime minister theresa may and straining relations between two close allies .
an attempt by police to restrict fransen s use of social media - twitter and facebook - was rejected by the judge on thursday .
fransen was fined last month after being found guilty by a court in england of religiously aggravated harassment for shouting abuse at a muslim woman wearing a hijab .
her lawyer told belfast magistrates court on thursday she would be pleading not guilty to the charges she faces in relation to the august rally .
golding is a former senior figure in the far-right british national party and founded britain first in 2011 .
the group describes itself as a patriotic political party and street movement .
critics denounce it as a racist organization .
