Jon Ritzheimer, infamous hater of Muslims and one of the terrorists responsible for the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, managed to escape the arrests made Tuesday by federal agents of ringleader Ammon Bundy and his band of right-wing nutjobs.According to a post on his Facebook page, Ritzheimer had returned to his home in Arizona to visit with his family:That was, of course, the real reason Ritzheimer was part of the occupation to begin with: Money.
After his armed protest of a mosque in Arizona failed to bring in the $10 million he said he needed for security upgrades, Ritzheimer began appearing at idiotic movements all over the place.
His last was the Bundy fiasco in Oregon.
Ritzheimer has proven he will go out of his way to find a reason to beg for money, and this was no different.
Before turning himself in, he released this video on his Facebook page, along with yet another plea for help for legal fees and for help for his family, who he clearly can t support.Ritzheimer has proven he will go out of his way to find a reason to beg for money, and this was no different.

It s a real tear-jerker anytime you see a man who has repeatedly abandoned his family to fight for stupidity a thousand miles away:https://www.facebook.com/scrappyphx.rider/videos/474428609411611/?autoplay_reason=gatekeeper&video_container_type=0&app_id=6628568379Along with the video was yet another post, complete with a link for donations.
Apparently Ritzheimer was pretty well prepared to NOT die for the cause:That s all he wants.
A couple of weeks ago all he wanted was to die for the cause.
Now all he wants is the government to play by his rules.
Let s be honest, Jon all you want is money.There s no official word yet on Ritzhewimer s arrest or bail requirements.
