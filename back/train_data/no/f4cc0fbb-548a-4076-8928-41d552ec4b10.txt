bernie sanders is on fire , especially after this weekend s resounding victories in washington , alaska , and hawaii , which have propelled the democratic presidential hopeful s campaign to unprecedented momentum as the democratic primary moves forward .
speaking in front of a crowd of thousands in wisconsin on saturday , sanders said : let me begin by thanking the people of alaska for giving us a resounding victory tonight .
we are making significant inroads in secretary clinton s lead and we have with your support coming here to wisconsin , we have a path toward victory .
alright , are you ready for a news alert ?
we just won the state of washington .
the crowd then erupted .
now , there s a new ad that celebrates those weekend victories with bernie dancing to the tune of the song the bird is the word , which plays off of the bird that landed on a podium earlier in the week while sanders was speaking in portland , oregon , hence the new nickname birdie sanders .
the ad highlights the landslide victories in washington and alaska on saturday , and idaho and utah earlier in the week.the victories are quite impressive because of the sheer number of voters who overwhelmingly supported sanders .
in idaho , he won with 78 % of the vote .
while in utah he received 79 % , alaska 81 % , washington 72 % , and hawaii with 70 % .the sanders campaign definitely seems to be gaining momentum towards the possibility getting the democratic nomination .
it will be interesting to see how this may help him going forward through upcoming primaries.watch video here : [ youtube https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=hogd3kmaosc ] featured image via video screenshot .
