istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish prosecutors have issued detention warrants for 117 military personnel over alleged links to the u.s.-based cleric accused by ankara of orchestrating last year s attempted coup , security sources said on friday .
they said counter terrorism police in the western province of izmir launched an operation early on friday to detain the military staff , some of whom served in key units of the armed forces .
turkey says supporters of islamic preacher fethullah gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in the united states since 1999 , were behind the abortive putsch in which 250 people were killed .
he has denied involvement .
the personnel facing arrest had been in phone contact with senior members of the cleric s movement between 2010 and july 15 last year when the coup was launched , the sources said .
since then more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over links to gulen , while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors for the same reason .
rights groups and some of turkey s western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government argues that only a massive purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says deeply infiltrated turkey s institutions - the army , schools and courts .
