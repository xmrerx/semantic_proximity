Robert Jaynes Jr. of Irvington, Indiana s Bible Baptist Church was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison after pleading guilty to federal drug charges earlier this week.According to Indy Star, Jaynes, described as a fire and brimstone, fundamentalist preacher, used the church as a cover for a multi-million-dollar drug enterprise, which reached from New Palestine to China.
More than a dozen others were arrested in connection with the Bible Baptist Church drug ring, during an FBI sting that encompassed several states.Those involved in the drug operation included a ring of police officers, school teachers, even a traveling clown who ran as a Libertarian candidate for the Indiana senate, Doug Sloan.Another man accused of running a front for the drug operation, David Neal, killed himself while awaiting trial.
According to Indy Star, Neal operated a business called IDK (I Don t Know) Anything LLC.
He was accused of purchasing more than $240,000 worth of drugs from the pastor, which he then sold through another business, Beautiful Cars of Indiana.Jaynes, Sloan and others involved in the drug operation reportedly all have ties to Russell Taylor, the former head of Jared Fogle s Foundation, who is now in prison for child pornography.All-in-all authorities say that the pastor produced over a 100 tons of synthetic marijuana, bringing in more than $2.6 million through the synthetic drug sales.As Indy Star reports:Jaynes employed church members in his drug enterprise, and members wrote personal checks to foreign suppliers of illegal substances used to make spice.
Some laundered profits through personal bank accounts.
Others produced and packaged the drugs at warehouses run by Jaynes and Parsons.
One even kept the drug ring s books.According to Esquire, most of Jayne s church members believed that they were helping the pastor run a potpourri business.Indy Star reports that through it all Jaynes continued to preach the word of God, fervently imploring his parishioners to turn away from earthly temptations.
