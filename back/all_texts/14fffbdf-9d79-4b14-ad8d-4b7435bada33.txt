It s really quite ironic that the guy who has paid and non-paid protesters inciting violence and riots at virtually every Trump rally across America is being attacked by leftists on him home turf.
Seriously though Bernie Sanders is as far left as a politician can go without becoming a declared Communist.
What bone could a leftist protester possibly have to pick with Bernie?
The guy is like Santa Claus, but with other people s money.
He s promising to punish every rich person in American while rewarding the lazy.
What more do these freaks want?
At least four people at a Bernie Sanders rally in Oakland rushed the stage Monday evening, spurring Secret Service agents to jump onto the raised platform and protect him.The Democratic presidential candidate was uninjured and continued speaking, but not before several agents hugged him and pushed him away from the microphone.
The identities of the individuals, who yelled as they approached the stage, were not immediately known.
They were apprehended and led away by Secret Service from the podium at the Frank Ogawa Plaza, where the rally was being held.
After the events of Monday night in Northern California, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said, It was handled professionally by the Secret Service.
