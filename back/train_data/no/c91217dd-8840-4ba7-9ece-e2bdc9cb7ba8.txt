the vfw in strongsville , ohio has it right .
they re exercising their freedom to turn off the tv when the cleveland browns are on .
what do you think about this ban ?
we think two can play this game stand up for our flag and national anthem ! the strongsville , oh vfw gets it ! the cleveland browns anthem protest continues to reverberate through the region as residents take sides for and against the on-field activism.on thursday , vfw commander tim zvoncheck posted a message to his facebook page , informing the public that his strongsville post would no longer air games on sundays.zvoncheck s message reads : so tonight , i asked the membership of my post , vfw 3345 , what they thought of the cleveland browns players kneeling during the national anthem and the coaching staff backing their decision .
just as i suspected , the boos nearly tore the roof off .
effective immediately , vfw post 3345 will no longer televise any cleveland browns games !
we will never support any person or organization who disgraces the flag or the anthem that we fought for and so many or our brothers and sisters have died for !
until a formal apology by this organization is publicized and the utter disregard to america ceases , we , as veterans of this great country will not stand for this !
we love our browns , but we love our flag more god bless america and damn those who think differently !
