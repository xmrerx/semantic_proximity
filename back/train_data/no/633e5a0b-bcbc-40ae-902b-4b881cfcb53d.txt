the war on the american flag continues.retired mounted an american flag in front of his house , the same flag that he carried with him on duty across five continents.one morning last week , the vet woke up to find his car smashed with the flag pole and the flag desecrated with a marker .
the message that i would like to say is america is still the greatest country in the world , hernandez garcia said on fox and friends weekend .
it s not something that we are just brainwashed with .
we are still the greatest country .
we got problems .
everybody does .
the flag represents freedom .
when you step on the flag , you really are stepping on those veterans that have really fought for you .
and everybody else , including your own parents , grandparents and great-grandparents and so forth , hernandez garcia said .
so , if you are watching this , i would like to tell you , come and talk to me .
let s talk about things .
let s not destroy things .
our country needs dialogue more than violence .
he said that social media has a major influence on people , so maybe someone saw the recent stomp the flag challenge and was inspired.tucker carlson and ainsley earhardt revealed that america s mighty warriors , a group that helps support military families , will be paying for the damages to hernandez garcia s car and flagpole , plus paying for a weekend vacation for two .
in addition to that , a flag will be flown over the u.s. capitol in honor of his service.via : fox and friends
