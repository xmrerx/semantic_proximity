lyon , france ( reuters ) - attackers set fire to vehicles beneath a housing complex for police and their families in a suburb of grenoble , eastern france , on thursday .
police said a fence around the building was closed off in an apparent attempt to prevent residents escaping and rescuers getting in , but all 24 people inside escaped unharmed .
nobody claimed responsibility for the assault , which was the latest in a series of arson attacks against police and police vehicles .
attacks like this can be tantamount to terrorism , grenoble prosecutor jean-yves coquillat told reporters , adding that the method used was similar to other recent attacks by far-left groups .
last month , such a group claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a police building in grenoble that destroyed a warehouse and several cars .
the group said the fire was a protest against the trial of nine far-left activists accused of firebombing police in an assault on two officers in paris in may 2016 that was caught on camera .
last month , five police cars were set on fire in limoges , central france .
french police are on high alert after a series of islamic state-inspired attacks that have killed more than 240 people in the past three years .
aside from the islamist threat , far-left and far-right militancy has also not let up .
police this month arrested 10 far-right militants suspected of planning attacks on mosques and politicians .
