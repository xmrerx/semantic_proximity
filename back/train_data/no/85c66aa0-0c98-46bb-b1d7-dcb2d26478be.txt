nairobi ( reuters ) - burundi s main opposition grouping said it is boycotting peace talks that resumed on tuesday in tanzania , leaving little chance that the negotiations will end simmering political violence that has claimed hundreds of lives .
burundi has been gripped by unrest since april 2015 , when president pierre nkurunziza announced he would stand for a third term , which the opposition said violated the constitution as well as a 2005 peace deal that ended the civil war .
he won a vote largely boycotted by the opposition , but protests sparked a government crackdown that has killed more than 700 people , displaced over 400,000 to neighboring countries and left the economy moribund .
the international criminal court is investigating whether pro-government forces committed war crimes including murder , torture and rape .
burundi , which has withdrawn from the court , is refusing to recognize the investigation .
exiled opposition grouping cnared said former tanzanian president benjamin mkapa , who is facilitating the nov. 28-dec. 8 round of talks in arusha , had not invited them .
we have always asked the facilitator to invite cnared as an opposition bloc , but he has refused and rather decided to select some of our members who will take part to the dialogue without our consent , said cnared spokesman pancrace cimpaye .
at the end of october , burundi s cabinet adopted draft legislation seeking to change the current constitution to allow nkurunziza to run for a fourth term in the 2020 election .
the proposed amendments , likely to go to a referendum by next year , seek to abolish the two-term limit and lengthen the presidential terms to seven years .
cnared says amending the constitution will worsen the crisis .
