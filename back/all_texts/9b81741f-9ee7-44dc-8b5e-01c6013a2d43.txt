BRUSSELS (Reuters) - North Korea s latest missile launch undermines regional and international security and Pyongyang needs to re-engage in credible dialogue with the international community, NATO said in a statement on Tuesday.
North Korea fired a missile that landed close to Japan in the early hours of Wednesday, the first test by Pyongyang since a missile fired over its neighbor in mid-September.
The Pentagon said its initial assessment was that it was an intercontinental ballistic missile.
I strongly condemn North Korea s new ballistic missile test.
This is a further breach of multiple UN Security Council Resolutions, undermining regional and international security, Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General of the trans-Atlantic NATO alliance said in a statement.
