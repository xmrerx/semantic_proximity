Texas Senator Ted Cruz is a weirdo.
Even his Republican colleague, Senator John McCain has called him a wacko bird.
A few weeks ago a disturbing video from when Cruz was 18-years-old.
Aspirations, is that like sweat on my butt?
said Cruz in the beginning of the video.
Cruz then goes on to add his life goal is to take over the world and be rich and powerful.
The horrifying thing is if he is elected president, he would certainly use it to succeed in the latter, and his foreign policies would probably align with aspirations for world domination.Most recently, a high school yearbook photo of Ted Cruz has surfaced, and there is nothing endearing or nostalgically relatable about the photo.
Ted Cruz went transferred to Second Baptist High School in his Junior Year of High School.
Not surprisingly, Cruz desperately tried to assimilate with the cool kids, and by all accounts failed miserably.
He was very active in drama club though.
Cruz loved being on stage, even if it meant being the villain, reported NPR in July 2015.
In junior high school, he had played Rolfe, the young Nazi in The Sound of Music.
He landed the role of the murderer Bill Sikes in Oliver during high school.
The yearbook photo taken depicts another one of Cruz s creepy roles in high school, as a biblical mime, supposedly depicting the first man, Adam.
In an interview with the Daily Dot, the photographer of the yearbook photo, Mark Neath, could not recall taking the photo, but did remember Cruz s strange life aspirations.
I do distinctly remember him boasting that he would become president one day, Neath wrote to the Daily Dot.
That s my greatest memory of him, in fact, since that was a pretty unusual life ambition for a high school student.
