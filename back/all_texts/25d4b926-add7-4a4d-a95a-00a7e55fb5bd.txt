Mitt Romney got a lot of praise and a lot of headlines this past year when he came out and attacked Donald Trump s presidential campaign, and made himself the de facto head of the Never Trump movement.
But now he has completely humiliated himself by sucking up to Trump after the election, first appearing to him to beg him for the Secretary of State job, then going out to dinner with Trump and RNC chairman Reince Priebus in New York.After dining with the man who made fun of him at every turn for months on end, Romney appeared without his dignity after the meal to heap more praise on Trump:WATCH: @MittRomney addresses reporters following dinner with President-elect @realDonaldTrump.

George Romney marched with Martin Luther King) is a disgusting moment in American politics, and shows once again that the moral outrage demonstrated by Never Trump was as phony as a three dollar bill.And perhaps it shouldn t be surprising.
When Trump was best known in politics for pushing the racist birther conspiracy, it was Mitt Romney who first elevated his stature in mainstream Republican politics.
Against advice from his team and against good taste, Romney held an event in 2012 where Trump endorsed him and the two men stood on stage together, slapping each other s backs.Later in the campaign, when Trump was pushing conspiracy theories about Obama s college record, Romney also enlisted Trump to cut advertising for him in the form of robocalls to help get out the vote.So Romney going to Trump, on bended knee in front of cameras from the international and national press, is just another chapter in the story of once-powerful men humiliating themselves in front of a clown, abandoning whatever little shred of principles they had left, just to get a sip of the power.
