at this point , we have to wonder if the pressure of finding himself outside his bubble and confronted with the overwhelming realization that everyone hates him has gotten to donald trump .
on wednesday , the donald woke up , ironed his klan robes , gave ivanka a deep , creepy good morning kiss , and sat down on his couch in yellow-stained underwear to whine about obama on twitter ( at least , this seems how a typical trump morning would go ) , and tweeted his latest , dumbest attack on the president.trump s new daily ritual of childishly attacking president obama on twitter hasn t gone well for him , with his delusion rapidly progressing from i could have beaten obama to i did beat obama while the world mocked him at levels no normal human being could withstand .
but this is trump .
he s special .
somehow he remains not immune but oblivious to the fact that outside his little fan club , he s just an orange-faced bigot with tiny hands who got absolutely trounced in the popular vote .
somehow , he is able to find the strength to keep his little thumbs moving faster than his brain to produce award-winningly ignorant , misinformed , and utterly idiotic tweets at an astounding rate .
doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory president o statements and roadblocks , the donald tweeted .
thought it was going to be a smooth transition not !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 28 , 2016president obama has done nothing to impede the transition .
in fact , he has been downright helpful , even giving the donald advice the many times trump came crawling and begging for it .
i must tell you , you know , i never met him before this .
i never spoke to him before this .
i really i do like him , trump said after finally meeting the man he had been attacking for years , even questioning his citizenship .
i love getting his ideas .
and i may differ in many cases .
i differ very greatly .
but apparently , the donald is done playing nice with the man who had been devoting overtime to ensuring that the president-elect doesn t f * ck things up too badly .
as is becoming almost a daily ritual , the internet came down hard on trump for his latest nonsensical attack on the guy who has been going out of his way to ensure a smooth transition .
@ realdonaldtrump fixed that consumer sentiment thing for you .

@ realdonaldtrump no one says `` not '' anymore .
also avoid `` just sayin '' , `` my bad , '' and `` where 's the beef . ''
shannon watts ( @ shannonrwatts ) december 28 , 2016 @ realdonaldtrump if `` doing my best to disregard '' means `` whining like a child on twitter '' you 're doing great !

jeremy m ( @ thismyshow ) december 28 , 2016 @ realdonaldtrump translation : our transition team & process is riddled with dysfunction , controversy , and failures need someone to blame !
horus gilgamesh ( @ awkwardbible ) december 28 , 2016president obama has been nothing but helpful , offering only reasonable criticisms for little things like teaming up with putin to hack and pervert out electoral process .
but the ease with which president obama takes up space in trump s head is impressive .
obama doesn t need to attack .
he just needs to exist and trump goes insane.featured image via getty images ( matthew cavanaugh ) /screengrab
