Hoo boy, Chrissy Teigen doesn t like Fox News.
After United Airlines came under fire for banning a couple of teen girls from a flight because they were wearing leggings (which are apparently inappropriate dress in the eyes of an airline people are quickly abandoning), Fox News quoted the model s opposition to the business ridiculous and puritanical decision that they are the arbiters of morality.
I have flown United before with literally no pants on, Teigen had said.
Just a top as a dress.
Next time I will wear only jeans and a scarf.

I respectfully ask you please don t ever tag me in anything, ever, Teigen replied.
Words cannot explain how much I detest you.
