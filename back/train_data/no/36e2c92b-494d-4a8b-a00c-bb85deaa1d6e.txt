buenos aires ( reuters ) - argentina s main labor unions took to the streets of the capital on tuesday demanding more jobs and protesting center-right president mauricio macri s economic policies .
tens of thousands of workers gathered in the historic plaza de mayo criticizing macri , who is trying to lower labor costs to attract investment and jump-start an economy that emerged from recession in the second half of last year .
if some retrograde ( in the government ) thinks that lowering wages , precarious living conditions and destroying trade unions is going to line up investments ... we say that is very wrong , said juan carlos schmid , a leader of argentina s largest umbrella union , the cgt .
standing on a podium at the protest , he said the cgt would meet in late september to discuss a potential strike .
macri told reuters in an interview this month his government was negotiating labor agreements sector by sector rather than trying to pass a comprehensive labor reform like the one approved in neighboring brazil .
unions fear more drastic changes could be coming after mid-term legislative elections in october , however , especially after a primary vote on aug. 13 pointed to strong support for macri s coalition .
macri is trying to open argentina s long protected economy and focus on competitive industries like oil and agriculture , but has seen some manufacturing jobs lost in the meantime .
the most recent employment data showed the jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent in the first quarter of the year from 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year .
