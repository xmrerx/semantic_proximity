valletta ( reuters ) - maltese police have arrested 10 suspects in the murder of anti-corruption blogger daphne caruana galizia , the country s prime minister said on monday , almost two months after she was killed when her car was blown up .
all of the suspects are maltese nationals and most have a criminal record , prime minister joseph muscat said , without providing any further details .
the police have 48 hours to question the suspects , arraign them or release them .
muscat initially announced eight arrests at a press conference , then later said on twitter that two more had been apprehended .
authorities have all areas of interest under control since early this morning and searches are underway , he said .
a section of lighters wharf in marsa was sealed off early on monday as helicopters circled above .
military and police used sniffer dogs to search .
caruana galizia , 53 , was murdered on oct. 16 as she was driving away from her house in northern malta .
she wrote a popular blog in which she relentlessly highlighted cases of alleged graft targeting politicians from across party lines .
galizia was following leads from the panama papers , which were leaked in 2015 and show how the world s rich use offshore firms to hide their wealth .
she had also accused senior figures in the government and opposition of corruption and money laundering .
all have denied the accusations and galizia was hit with 36 libel suits in the nine months preceding her death .
her murder shocked malta and raised concern within the european union about the rule of law on the mediterranean island .
concluding a fact-finding mission on friday , a group of eu lawmakers said there was a perception of impunity in malta .
