Students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) are demanding campus officials identify the individuals responsible for spray-painting racist graffiti, along with pro-Donald Trump messages, on campus property overnight on Saturday.According to the local CBS affiliate, the vandalism was carried out by five men wearing hoods, who were seen by UCSD students.This weekend UCSD is hosting prospective students from around the world, who will be making a decision about which school to attend in 2017.Cultural buildings on campus, which faculty says are there to help racially diverse students feel welcome at UCSD, were specifically targeted with the messages.The graffiti included messages directed at Muslims, Jews, LGBTQ people and other groups.CBS8 visited the campus as the graffiti was being removed.
According to their report, some of the language used by the vandals was too offensive to show on camera.One message was clear, however.
Spray-painted on the sidewalk outside of a main campus building were the words Build the wall and Deport them all.
#DonaldTrump was also spray-painted on the walkway, along with the words The Mexicans will pay for it.

The ghetto-themed party, organized by white students, was designed to make a mockery of Black history month.After a noose was found hanging from one of the buildings on campus, a student walk-out, accompanied by large scale protests on campus led to the declaration of a racial emergency.
In order to diffuse tensions, university officials accepted a list of 32 student demands presented by member of the Black Student Union.In the years since the Compton Cookout, students have routinely criticized campus officials for failing to live up the 2010 agreement.The rise of Donald Trump has led to an increase of similar racist activity at Universities across the country.Trump has lent his stamp of approval to hate speech and to the kind of race-hatred that is only expressed by hooded men, under the cover of darkness.Featured image via video screen capture CBS8
