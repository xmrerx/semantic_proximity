( reuters ) - the puerto rico senate has approved the prepa revitalization act , intended to restructure the country ’ s debt-laden power utility , a spokesman for prepa said .
the bill now moves to the puerto rico house of representatives , which would need to approve it before it could become law .
“ this legislation provides prepa with critical tools to make prepa the modern utility that puerto rico needs and deserves , ” the company said in a statement on wednesday .
prepa , with more than $ 8 billion in debt , reached a restructuring deal in december with about 70 percent of its creditors .
that deal hit a roadbump in january when puerto rico ’ s lawmakers failed to meet a jan. 22 deadline to pass necessary legislation .
however , the agency and bondholders agreed to extend a crucial deadline to feb. 16 .
