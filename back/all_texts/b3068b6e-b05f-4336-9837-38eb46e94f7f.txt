Former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has been forced to deny a claim that he ordered the outlandish dirty dossier on President-elect Donald Trump.The BBC initially named Bush, one of Trump s opponent in the 2016 Republican primary, as having enlisted the services of Washington-based political research firm FusionGPS to look into Trump s business dealings.FusionGPS later hired ex-MI6 spy Christopher Steele to dig further into Trump s connections with Russia.
He (Steele) was compiling this report on behalf of initially Trump s opponent Jeb Bush, the BBC said on Wednesday.
The BBC subsequently said on Thursday its Washington correspondent Paul Wood misspoke.Bush s spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, categorically denied any involvement between Bush and Steele.
It is absolutely not true that Governor Bush had any knowledge or involvement with this gentleman and his allegations, Campbell told Reuters by phone It s nothing we ve ever seen before.
However, Bush s camp have not specifically ruled out any contact with FusionGPS.On Thursday, the former Florida state governor said it s unlikely he ll run for office again.Bush said that life goes on and that he s focused on building up his business again and working with the foundation he created to push for changes in education policy.
He s also ruling out running again for governor in his home state.It seems what started in September 2015 as a fairly standard political research mission to scrutinize the business dealings of a presidential candidate unexpectedly spiralled into a series of increasingly bizarre and lurid claims, none of which are verified.
