Wow just wow!A pregnant woman has challenged pro life activists to pay her $1 million to keep her baby.In an anonymous essay titled How much would you pay to stop an abortion?
, the writer claims she is 26 years old, seven weeks pregnant, with every intention of aborting her fetus.But if she receives $1 million in 72 hours she will allegedly have the baby, put it up for adoption, and put every cent into a trust fund for the child to access at 21.Otherwise, every donation will be returned and she will go through with the abortion she has scheduled for July 10.Donations will be accepted from midnight July 7.Writing one-page website called prolifeantiwoman.com, the woman says the rallying cry is a protest against extremely restrictive abortion laws recently passed in the state where she attends graduate school.The laws, she writes, require women to wait 72 hours after a doctor consultation to have an abortion.North Carolina became the fourth state to assume a law of that nature last month, following Missouri, South Dakota, and Utah.She continues: The laws impose unnecessary waiting time to get an abortion and attempt to enforce rules that bypass the doctor/patient privacy privilege.
I now feel more comfortable traveling to my home state to get an abortion than I do trying to get one here.
The essay concludes: I hope to give the American public a concrete example that the conservative right in America doesn t actually care about the life of a child, they care about controlling the lives and choices of women.
We have to acknowledge this and we have to stop it.
