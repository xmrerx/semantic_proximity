If there s anyone right now worthy of complete and utter condemnation, it s Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.
So, while speaking at a tech conference in San Francisco, Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid into Trump hard.Zuckerberg said: I m starting to see people and nations turning inward against this idea of a connected world.
I hear fearful voices talking about building walls It takes courage to choose hope over fear.
Instead of building walls we can help build bridges.
Instead of dividing people we can connect people.
We do it one person at a time, one connection at time.
That s why I think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before.
This, of course, is a direct jab at Trump s ridiculous idea that the United States should build a giant wall spanning the entire length of the U.S./Mexico border.
And Zuckerberg is right we shouldn t be building walls, we should be tearing them down and building relationships that will foster future growth and development between the neighboring nations.Zuckerberg also said: Our lives are connected.
Whether we re welcoming a refugee fleeing war or an immigrant seeking new opportunity.
Whether we re coming together to fight global diseases like Ebola or to fight climate change, we have the courage to see that the path forward is to bring people together, not push people apart.
Which is exactly right.
We don t need a leader of our nation that is going to build walls to keep the world out, and in essence, keep us in.
This sort of isolationist, xenophobic and nonsensical fear-baiting serves absolutely no one.
It doesn t keep us safer, and it most certainly doesn t foster relationships with the rest of the world.
Hopefully the nation will come together this November who will seek to build bridges and not walls.Featured Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images via Flickr
