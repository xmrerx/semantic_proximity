paris ( reuters ) - pope francis saw a jewish psychoanalyst once a week for six months during the 1970s and found the experience beneficial , the pontiff was quoted as saying in a new book .
for six months , i went to her once a week to shed light on certain things , the argentine pontiff said in a series of interviews with french sociologist dominique wolton , extracts from which were published by le figaro on friday .
she was very good , very professional ... but she always remained in her proper place , the 80-year-old said , adding he was aged 42 at the time .
she helped me a lot .
the excerpts released did not name the psychoanalyst or explain why the sessions had been originally set up .
francis said she had called him when she was on the verge of death , not for sacraments , because she was jewish , but for a spiritual dialogue .
francis , who has campaigned for a more open and inclusive catholic church , criticized rigid priests , who are afraid of communicating .
it is a kind of fundamentalism .
when i come across someone rigid , especially if they are young , i say to myself that they are sick .
in reality , they are looking for security .
the book , pope francis : meetings with dominique wolton , politics and society is due for publication by les editions de l observatoire on sept. 6 .
