Flip flopping is what Maxine Waters has been doing when it comes to calling for the impeachment of President Trump.
See the video below for just one of many examples of Waters lying through her teeth saying she never called for the impeachment of Trump.
Here she is at a CBC Town Hall revving up the crowd with her phony baloney call for the impeachment of Trump.
We re guessing it all depends on who she s talking to.
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who previously has called for the impeachment of Donald Trump, on Thursday told a Congressional Black Caucus Town Hall on Civil Rights that she expects other members of the black community to back her up: Impeachment is about whatever the congress says it is.
Seems as though Maxine Waters is willing to lie to have President Trump impeached.

But when you gonna give me some support?
she asked.
How many of you in your organizations have said, Impeach 45 ?
Waters urged the crowd not to get hung up on what law to invoke in the impeachment process:Impeachment is about whatever the Congress says it is.
There is no law that dictates impeachment.
What the Constitution says is high crimes and misdemeanors, and we define that.Bill Clinton got impeached because he lied.
Here you have a president, who I can tell you and guarantee you is in collusion with the Russians to undermine our democracy.
Here you have a president who obstructed justice.
And here you have a president who lies every day.Thank God that the special counsel is beginning to connect the dots and understand Facebook s role in it and social media s role in it.
When is the black community going to say, Impeach him ?
It s time to go after him.
I don t hear you!Don t another person come up to me and say, You go, girl.
No, you go!Waters received a standing ovation Oy vey!MAXINE DENIES CALLING FOR TRUMP S IMPEACHMENT:WHICH IS IT?
