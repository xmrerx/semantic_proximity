sydney ( reuters ) - ten million australians , or 62.5 percent of eligible voters , have cast their votes so far in a postal ballot on whether same-sex marriage should be legalized , the bureau of statistics said on tuesday .
that was up from an estimate of 9.2 million made a week ago .
australians began voting last month in the non-binding poll to inform the government on whether voters wanted australia to become the 25th nation to permit same-sex marriage .
the results will be announced on nov. 15 .
the response rate already surpasses the 60.5 percent reached in ireland s same-sex marriage referendum in 2015 .
