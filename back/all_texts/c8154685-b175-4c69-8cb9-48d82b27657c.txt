Years ago, Donald Trump tweeted that he hoped Russian dictator Vladimir Putin would become his new best friend.
During the debates, he looked immensely sad as he said the words he s not my best friend when he was accused of being a Russian puppet.
But now that Vladimir Putin has helped him get elected and Trump has taken to openly praising the Russian president on Twitter, it seems that they are finally ready to buy matching friendship bracelets and make it official.On Friday, Vladimir Putin announced that he would not immediately retaliate against the United States for expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence agents.
Putin, who personally directed an effort to hack Donald Trump s opposition in what the CIA has confirmed was a far-reaching effort to install Donald Trump as President, has been earning nothing but praise from The Donald, who says with a wink-and-a-nod that he totally knew nothing about anything that was happening and denies that Russia is responsible for the hacks.Putin says that instead, he will wait for Donald Trump to become President before he decides how to move forward a fairly concrete sign that the two are working in collusion.
At any point, Trump could say no more!
At any point, he could be honest with the American people about their relationship and possibly even avoid prison time.
Unfortunately, this is Donald Trump we re talking about, and he seems to be immune to scrutiny, prosecution, or anything else he deserves.
Further steps toward the restoration of Russian-American relations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of President D. Trump will carry out, Putin said Friday.This is another time trump could have stepped up.
He could have cemented his place as a strong President by telling Putin that he stands by the decision to expel 35 suspected spies.
Instead, he sided with Russia yet again, praising his President for the delay something that will virtually ensure that Putin gets whatever he wants.Great move on delay (by V. Putin) I always knew he was very smart!

We re already seeing discord in GOP congress over your un-American behavior.
Keep going.

@realDonaldTrump Don't you think it might be more appropriate for you to praise the American president instead of the Russian president?

About him.
About his supporters.

Silvia Ramirez (@shoutthetruth2) December 30, 2016@realDonaldTrump YOU FUCKING TRAITOR Boycott Trump SCION (@puppymnkey) December 30, 2016For years, conservatives have accused President Obama of treason every time he so much as sneezed.
Under 18 U.S. Code 2381, treason is defined as such:Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.While nothing Obama has done has come close, isn t Trump s repeated praise of Putin a man who personally oversaw an attack on our nation giving aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere?
Isn t the fact that the Russian President s delay until his puppet was in office a move Trump praised adhering to an enemy of the United States?I won t wish death on Trump, even if his actions call for it under our nation s laws.
Death would give him an easy out and prevent him from learning what it s like to wake up every day staring at the cold walls of a prison cell.Featured image via Getty Images (Justin Sullivan)/screengrab
