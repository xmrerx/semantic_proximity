beijing ( reuters ) - stability is an absolute principle that needs to be dealt with using strong hands , chinese president xi jinping has told security officials ahead of next month s key congress of the ruling communist party .
the stability-obsessed party brooks no challenge to its rule and always steps up security ahead of important meetings .
those working in the public security sector should improve their political awareness and maintain the authority and unified leadership of the party , xi said , in comments reported by the official xinhua news agency late on tuesday .
xi noted that development and stability were the absolute principles , so both should be dealt with by strong hands , xinhua said .
it is important to prevent and control major risks through the party s leadership , xi added .
more effort needs to be exerted to improve social governance by socialism with chinese characteristics to ensure the country enjoys long-term peace and stability , he was cited as saying .
xi has overseen a broad crackdown on civil society since he assumed office almost five years ago , locking up rights lawyers and dissidents who the government has accused of breaking the law and in some cases of seeking to subvert party rule .
the party also remains wary of what it terms mass incidents , a euphemism for protests , of which there are thousands every year in china , over everything from illegal land seizures and pollution to corruption .
the party opens its once-every-five years congress on oct. 18 , where xi will seek to consolidate his already tight grip on power .
