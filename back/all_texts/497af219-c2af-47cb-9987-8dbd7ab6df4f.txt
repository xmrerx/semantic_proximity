Sean Hannity is a dick and Twitter let him know it.During his radio show on Tuesday, the Fox News host and Trump propagandist had a meltdown because the White House ignored a fake story about President Obama saying he would move to Canada if the Republican nominee wins the election on November 8th.And so, Hannity accused Obama of not making an effort to unite behind Trump if he becomes president and retaliated by offering to send Obama and his family to Africa on condition that they can never come back to America.
I ll pay hang on a second, I m offering I ll even rent a plane as big as Air Force One.
[ ] I have an offer for the president.
I will charter a plane for you and your family.
I will make sure it s as big a plane as Air Force One, what you have grown accustomed to, in other words.
Taxpayer-funded plane.
I don t know where I m going to get Maybe I ll just Maybe I ll ask Trump if I can charter his plane for Obama.
That s what I will charter Donald Trump s plane if he ll let me, and I will charter it to the country of your choice.
You want to go to Canada?
I ll pay for you to go to Canada.
You want to go to Kenya?
I ll pay for you to go to Kenya.
Jakarta, where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there.
Anywhere you want to go.
I m gonna I ll put the finest food, caviar, champagne, you name it.
I have one stipulation: you can t come back.
That s fair.
Sending black people back to Africa is a racist wet dream and Hannity just endorsed it.Naturally, people were pretty pissed off at Hannity for his level of disrespect toward President Obama.What a vile human being @seanhannity is.
Someone should pay him to shut up.

Eric (@ramseur) October 26, 2016@seanhannity Pres Obama s myriad accomplishments and proud legacy will dwarf your pointless and useless contributions in this life.

He called journalism dead, insulted a bunch a people on his feed, and whined because everyone is against Trump..Unlike @BarackObama I don t have a spokesperson that refuses to say he s not leaving if @realDonaldTrump wins I ll stay and fight win/lose!

I m a talk show host.
I am honest about who I am.
The media claims to be objective, fair and balanced #Biasedmedia https://t.co/avvFvjEqHQ Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 26, 2016Sean Hannity, like other right-wing talk hosts are the reason why so many conservatives reject facts and refuse to believe what credible media outlets report.
Right-wing host Charlie Sykes even admitted in August that people like Hannity have poisoned journalism and that s why we ended up with a toxic presidential candidate like Trump.
We ve created this monster, he said.
Look, I m a conservative talk show host.
All conservative talk show hosts have basically established their brand as being contrasted with the mainstream media.
So we have spent 20 years demonizing the liberal mainstream media at a certain point you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible outlet out there.
And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that.
We ve basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers, he added.And Sean Hannity is continuing that quest to destroy the credible media so he can spread his fact-free propaganda.Featured Image: Screenshot
