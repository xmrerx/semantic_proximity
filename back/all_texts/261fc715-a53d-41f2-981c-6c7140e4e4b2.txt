At the start of the Fox News Greg Gutfeld Show, Gutfeld showed a hilarious clip mocking the hysteria of the Democrat Party.
Gutfeld began his show by telling his viewers, I m really excited to introduce a new sponsor to our show.
It s a new drug.
It s called Victima' Gutfeld went on to explain that the drug was created to help Democrats who are feeling defeated after the brutal election of Donald Trump cope: When identity politics no longer work, try Victima .America s been witnessing the embarrassing meltdown of liberals ever since President Trump shocked the world with his stinging defeat of Crooked Hillary, so Gutfeld decided to have a little fun by mocking the embarrassing behavior of the left.The voice in the commercial mimics the typical TV drug commercials with sappy music playing in the background: It s not what it used to be.
It used to be fine.The Democratic Party it s not performong.It s slow, sluggish, confused, prone to fits of despair.
It may be time for Victima .
Victims, when your old identity politics no longer work, Victima gives you that added boost to get you to where you want to be.
When I take Victima, I see everyone as a racist .
It really works.
Watch:Ironically, FOX News fired Bob Beckel, the only liberal on the Gutfeld Show the day after this show aired, after he allegedly made a racist remark that offended a black employee working at FOX.
Hmmm
