moscow ( reuters ) - russia will veto a draft u.n. resolution being pushed by the united states , britain and france which aims to bolster support for international inquiries into a deadly toxic gas attack in syria , the interfax news agency reported on wednesday .
the u.n. security council could vote on the draft resolution later on wednesday .
it is similar to a text circulated to the 15-member council last week that condemns the april 4 attack and pushes syria ’ s government to cooperate with investigators .
interfax cited russian deputy foreign minister gennady gatilov as saying russia would veto it in its current form .
