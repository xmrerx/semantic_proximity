berlin ( reuters ) - german police on monday investigated further suspicious mail packages found around the country as they tried to catch an extortionist who sent a defective parcel bomb to a pharmacy in the city of potsdam last week .
that package , which contained powerful firecrackers , wires and nails and did not explode , was found to be a criminal extortion attempt against logistics firm dhl rather than terrorism , german authorities said on sunday .
dhl , owned by deutsche post , warned its clients on monday that other suspect packages could arrive through its service among millions of parcels sent in the holiday season .
the company said it would not change its postal secrecy principle to control the content of packages .
more suspicious packages were reported to authorities around germany - one , which german media suspected contained a grenade , was sent to the state chancellery in the eastern region of thuringia but police found only rolled-up catalogues inside it .
police in the eastern state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , said they checked 10 suspicious packages on monday but gave the all-clear for all of those parcels .
the police said a special team investigating the potsdam pharmacy package was doubled to over 50 officials and they were searching for the extortionist .
