bangkok ( reuters ) - people in thailand celebrated the loy krathong or floating basket festival on friday , following a year of mourning for late king bhumibol adulyadej that saw many celebrations muted or canceled .
the mourning ended on monday after a five-day funeral last week , and many citizens have returned to wearing colored garments after having stuck to black for a year .
participants in the festival pay respects to the water spirits , floating small , traditionally-hand crafted rafts carrying flowers , bamboo and candles on waterways in an ancient ritual .
the rafts are also thought to carry away bad luck and usher in good fortune during the festival , which is celebrated all over thailand , but is particularly spectacular in the north .
festivities will stay in a low key this year , out of respect for the late monarch , however , authorities in the capital said .
we will not have excessive celebrations but will focus more on showcasing thai culture , chalermpon chotinuchit , of the bangkok metropolitan administration ( bma ) , told reuters .
the bma urged celebrants to use rafts made from natural materials this year , after environment groups flagged concerns about non-biodegradable components clogging rivers and drains .
festival participants also struck a somber note .
it will be a sadder period this loy krathong because everyone loves the late king rama ix , said 23-year-old nanthicha sorndee .
safety concerns have prompted national carrier thai airways international to cancel some roundtrip flights between bangkok and chiang mai on friday and saturday , it said in a statement , without elaborating .
the northern thai city celebrates loy krathong alongside yi peng , a festival in which brightly lit lanterns are wafted into the sky .
