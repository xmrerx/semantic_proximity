brasilia ( reuters ) - lawyers defending brazilian president michel temer on friday asked supreme court justice edson fachin to send back to the prosecutor s general office the new graft charges that were presented against temer on thursday .
temer s defense said in the request that the new charges are irregular because they cite events that presumably happened before he became president .
under the brazilian constitution , a sitting president can not be charged for possible crimes committed by him before he took office .
those charges would have to wait until he leaves to be taken to the courts .
the corruption charges presented on thursday were the second temer could face .
a first set of criminal charges saying that temer took bribes from meatpacker jbs sa was blocked in august by his allies in the lower house of congress , which has the power to decide whether a president should stand trial by the supreme court .
temer s lawyers said the second set of charges should return to the prosecutor s general office for reevaluation .
they want the cases that happened before he took office to be scrapped from the charges .
it is not clear when fachin would evaluate their request .
