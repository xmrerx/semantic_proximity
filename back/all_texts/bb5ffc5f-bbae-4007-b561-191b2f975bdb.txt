Everyone knows Donald Trump is a thin-skinned little whiner.
Elizabeth Warren knows it (and has proven it), Bill Maher knows it (and has come up with quite a nickname).
Trump can dish it out all he likes but he certainly can t take it.And who s gotten under his skin this time?
The speakers at the DNC.After the conclusion of the third night, in which V.P candidate Tim Kaine shredded trump by invoking one of his famous lines, believe me, the tough GOP candidate responded the only way he knew how by being a butt-hurt cry baby:Well, they don t all hit me, but some of them do.
And they try to hit you as hard as possible.
And it s mostly false stuff I get it.
It s the way it goes.
It s called politics I guess I take it a little bit personally.Cry me a river, you thin skinned demogauge.
Hillary has faced ceaseless personal attacks for decades much, much worse than any of the (accurate) remarks made at the DNC.
But has Hillary Clinton ever said she takes it personally?
No, she hasn t. That s because Hillary isn t thin-skinned, she isn t a quitter, and she certainly doesn t lack confidence.Trump is offended for the things Democrats said about him.
That s rich, coming from the guy that has spread lies about women, Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants, working women (including Hillary Clinton) and tried to convince the world President Obama wasn t born in America.It s only a matter of time until Donald totally loses it and says something he really shouldn t. As the campaign continues, Trump shows his real colors, his insecurities, and his weak nature.Sorry the truth hurts, Donald.
Maybe he shouldn t have ripped off all those businesses when he walked away from bankruptcy.
Maybe he shouldn t have mocked John McCain and that New York Times reporter.
Maybe he should have never called women bimbos, pigs, dogs and every other name in the book.His words will be his downfall, and he has no one to blame but himself.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images
