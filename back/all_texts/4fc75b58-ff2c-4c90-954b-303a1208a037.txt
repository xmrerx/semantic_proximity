WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Charles Schumer, the third-ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate, said on Tuesday he expects President Barack Obama to pick a “mainstream nominee” for the Supreme Court.
Schumer, in remarks to reporters, did not say who he thinks the nominee might be or when Obama will announce the replacement for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13.
