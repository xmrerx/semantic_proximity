just before an iranian-american businessman was freed from jail in iran in oct. 2010 , his son met with bill clinton and also made the first of what would become more than $ 1 million in donations to the clinton foundation.nima taghavi , who owns businesses in california , grew impatient in 2010 with negotiations to secure his father reza s release from an iranian prison , and so he turned to the former president for help.to arrange the meeting with clinton , taghavi first contacted doug band , who worked as clinton s body man , has counseled the clinton foundation , and co-founded teneo holdings , a consulting group that clinton advised.taghavi met with the former president in hopes that he would serve as special envoy to iran , sources told thedc .
and through his personal charity , the nima taghavi foundation , the businessman gave a $ 5,000 donation to the clinton foundation in 2010 .
he would go on to give more than $ 1 million over the next several years.the timing of the meeting and the first round of donations raises two questions : whether clinton promised to help taghavi in exchange for contributions to his family s organization and whether he violated an agreement not to personally solicit funds for his charity.as part of the deal to bring hillary clinton on board as secretary of state , the clintons signed a memorandum of understanding in dec. 2008 agreeing to the stipulation that bill clinton not raise money.it is unclear if hillary clinton knew of her husband s meeting with taghavi .
in an email informing clinton that an unnamed iranian-american businessman had been released from an iran jail clinton asked her aide huma abedin who the prisoner was .
abedin informed her it was reza taghavi.in an email with the subject why taghavi was released , a state department official wrote i understand [ clinton ] is asking .
the theory of a clinton-related quid pro quo whether hillary clinton knew about it or not is not unfounded , as it fits a pattern of the former first couple providing favors and access to donors to their charity and to their various political campaigns.read more : daily caller
