lilongwe ( reuters ) - three malawian ministers will testify in court against a former cabinet colleague charged with abuse of office over a maize procurement contract , court documents showed .
president peter mutharika launched an investigation in january into the government order for 100,000 tonnes of zambian white maize , after an opposition leader there said he had seen documents showing malawi had been charged $ 345 per ton instead of the $ 215 the consignment was worth .
then agriculture minister george chaponda was arrested in july , sacked and charged with abuse of office and possession of foreign currency without lawful justification .
he pleaded not guilty to both charges and was released on bail pending trial , for which no date has yet been set .
malawi was importing maize to ease food shortages triggered by a severe drought that swept the region in 2016 .
according to court documents seen by reuters , finance minister goodall gondwe , information nicoluas dausi and trade and industry minister henry mussa will be called to give evidence against chaponda .
the three ministers , who declined to comment , are expected to testify late this month , local newspapers said .
malawi s anti-corruption bureau also declined to comment when contacted by reuters .
