stockholm ( reuters ) - a man was jailed for 10 years for rape by a swedish court on thursday for forcing 27 children from the united states , canada and britain to perform sex acts on themselves or with other children that he viewed over the internet .
the case , heard in uppsala , marked the first time in sweden that a person has been convicted of rape without having met the victim - setting a precedent for such crimes over the internet to be treated as seriously as if they were committed in person .
the district court makes a very important assessment here .
it states clearly what is required for an act performed by a girl on her own body to be regarded as rape when the perpetrator is not in the same room , prosecutor annika wennerstrom told tt news agency .
this may lead to a different level of priority and status from the police in criminal investigations with these types of crimes .
the 41-year-old swede found the girls via social media and threatened to rape them and kill their families unless they committed the sex acts on themselves , on other children or with animals .
the children , most under the age of 15 , either streamed the acts to the man over the internet or recorded them and sent them later .
the man was also sentenced for a large number of acts of online sexual abuse of children and child pornography .
as a result of this case , wennerstrom said the means of investigation and the penalties could change .
we will be given the opportunity to use other types of methods with this legal classification , penalties will be longer and the chances for compensation for victims will increase , she said .
