ankara ( reuters ) - turkey said on monday its former economy minister , indicted in the united states for conspiring to violate u.s. sanctions on iran , acted within international law and that charges against him amounted to a coup attempt through american courts .
former minister zafer caglayan has protected turkey s interests as turkish economy minister , and has acted within the laws of our country and international laws while doing that , government spokesman bekir bozdag said .
the charges against caglayan were a repetition of the december feto coup attempt ... through the american judiciary , bozdag said , referring to 2013 leaks about alleged government corruption which were blamed on president tayyip erdogan s opponents .
caglayan and the ex-head of a state-owned turkish bank were charged on wednesday with conspiring to violate u.s. sanctions on iran by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the u.s. financial system on tehran s behalf .
[ nl8n1lo4ro ] the charges stem from the case against reza zarrab , a wealthy turkish-iranian gold trader who was arrested in the united states over sanctions evasion last year .
he has pleaded not guilty .
wednesday s indictment marked the first time an ex-government member with close ties to erdogan had been charged in the investigation that has strained ties between washington and ankara .
erdogan said last week he had told washington that turkey had never agreed to comply with its sanctions on iran , and called on the united states to review the indictment .
turkey s presidency said on saturday erdogan spoke by phone with u.s. president donald trump .
it did not say whether the two leaders discussed the case .
[ nl5n1lq0hv ] bozdag also condemned the indictment of erdogan s guards over violence during his visit to washington in june , saying it relied on testimony from supporters of the outlawed militant pkk group , and had done great damage to u.s.-turkish ties .
