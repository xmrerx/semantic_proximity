ankara ( reuters ) - seven people were wounded when an explosion hit a shuttle bus carrying prison guards in the turkish coastal province of izmir on thursday , and authorities were investigating a possible terrorist attack , the local mayor said .
the bus was hit as it passed a garbage container at around 7:40 a.m. ( 0440 gmt ) , levent piristina , the mayor of izmir s buca district , said on twitter .
photographs he posted on social media showed its windows blown out and its windscreen shattered .
the force of the blast appeared to have blown out some of the bus s panels , and the nearby street was littered with debris .
we are getting information from police sources and they are focusing on the possibility of a terrorist attack , he said , adding that all seven wounded were in good condition .
both state-run trt haber and private broadcaster dogan news agency said the explosion was caused by a bomb placed in the garbage container that exploded when the shuttle bus passed .
no one immediately claimed responsibility .
both kurdish militants and jihadist islamic state militants have carried out suicide and bomb attacks in major turkish cities in recent years .
kurdish militants have previously targeted buses carrying security personnel .
in december , a bomb killed at least 13 soldiers and wounded more than 50 when it ripped through a bus carrying off-duty military personnel in the central city of kayseri , an attack the government blamed on kurdish militants .
the kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , considered a terrorist organization by the united states , turkey and the european union , has waged a three-decade insurgency against the turkish state .
the outlawed pkk wants autonomy for turkey s largely kurdish southeast .
