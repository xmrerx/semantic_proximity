WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday “messages of hate and bigotry” from white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups should not be welcome anywhere in the United States.
“We can have no tolerance for an ideology of racial hatred.
There are no good neo-nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms.
We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head,” McConnell said in a statement.
