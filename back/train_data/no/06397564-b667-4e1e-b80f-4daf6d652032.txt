aden , yemen ( reuters ) - three suspected al qaeda militants were killed in a drone strike in southern yemen late on thursday , a local security official and residents said .
the strike in mudiyah district in abyan province on the arabian sea coast had targeted a motorcycle which the suspected militants were riding , the official said .
abyan is one of several provinces in central and southern yemen where al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) and its local affiliate ansar al-sharia operate .
aqap has taken advantage of a more than two-year civil war between the iran-aligned houthi group and president abd-rabbu mansour hadi s saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country .
the united states has repeatedly attacked aqap with aircraft and unmanned drones in what u.s. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group s ability to coordinate attacks abroad .
the saudi-led coalition supporting hadi has also launched thousands of air strikes against the houthis which control yemen s capital and much of the country s north .
the houthis have in turn fired rockets towards saudi cities and villages .
they say their attacks are in response to saudi strikes on yemeni cities and villages .
the coalition spokesman said on thursday that a saudi pilot had died a day earlier when his plane crashed in the southern province of abyan due to technical failure , the saudi news agency spa said .
the war has killed more than 10,000 people .
