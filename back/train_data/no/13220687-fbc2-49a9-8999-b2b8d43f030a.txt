santiago ( reuters ) - chilean presidential candidate sebastian pi era , who is leading in the polls for this november s elections , pledged on thursday to move the south american country toward a fully renewable electricity grid by 2040 .
conservative pi era , who previously served as chile s president from 2010 to 2014 , said that if elected he would seek to build on heavy investments the country has made in wind and solar energy .
the goal is that by 2040 , chile has a 100 percent clean and renewable electricity grid and a 100 percent electric public transit system , pi era said at a campaign rally .
chile is an obvious target for green energy firms .
it imports most of the oil and gas it uses , but its desert climate and long coastline makes solar and wind power a viable prospect , especially as prices for renewables have plunged .
a pi era victory would be welcomed by the copper-producing country s business community , which blames current center-left president michelle bachelet for stoking market uncertainty in one of latin america s most free-market economies .
but pi era is unlikely to win in the first round , and a december runoff against center-left candidate alejandro guillier or hard-left beatriz sanchez would likely be tight .
guillier and sanchez have both also spoken in favor of boosting renewable energy , though neither has given a specific time-frame for moving toward an all-clean grid .
