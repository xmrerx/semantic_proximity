donald trump kicked off his week with a ridiculous attack on former acting attorney general sally yates.yates , of course , was fired after she refused to back trump s first muslim ban in court .
it was , of course , later deemed unconstitutional and the administration suffered a fair amount of embarrassment from trump s decision to fire yates .
yates also warned the donald about michael flynn , who was later fired by the administration for allegedly lying to vice president mike pence about his specious contacts with russia .
ask sally yates , under oath , if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to w.h .
