Last week, Donald Trump Junior became a new focus for Senate investigators in the case against Russia regarding the 2016 election.
The New York Times did a piece on Wednesday detailing the fact that Junior was scheduled to meet with them (behind closed doors, of course) the following day and, well, you know the rest.It wasn t the article, explosive though it was, that captured the internet s attention, though.
It was the hilariously badly-staged photo that Don Jr. apparently staged for Todd Heisler, a photographer on the Times staff, and the image it was clearly trying and failing miserably to portray:I, too, casually arrange photographs of my 100 children to face outwards so I can only see the backs of frames pic.twitter.com/Pa0cHP5ayj Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) September 8, 2017See the problem?
Obviously when they were setting up the shoot, Son of the Deal decided he needed the world to know how much he loves his five kids.
So he took essentially every picture ever taken of them, put them in shiny frames, and arranged them to best be captured by the camera, dad s studious face aglow with the glare of hard work emanating from his computer monitor stern in the background.Facing away from him.It was just too good to pass up, and so Twitter did not:THE PHOTOS MUST EARN THE RIGHT TO FACE FATHER the September Son (@bagofbadgers) September 8, 2017I don't want to know what he uses those giant scissors for Sam Lloyd (@LloydWithTwoLs) September 8, 2017His photos shoots are all awkward af pic.twitter.com/LoVhqrVpyr pauisanoun (@pauisanoun) September 8, 2017Welp, he's always seemed to be somewhat genetically inferior.
