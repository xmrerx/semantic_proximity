according to the mother of the 35 year old murdered woman , this maggot had tried to murder her before .
but in obama s eyes he didn t present any danger to the community .
hmmm i wonder if those were his two girls if he might feel differently ? obama s early release program is going to work as expected .
a cocaine dealer who received early release murdered his ex-girlfriend and her two children .
he now faces the death penalty.criminals already plea down their cases and now thanks to obama they get to plea and plea again.wendell callahan , 35 , murdered erveena hammonds , 32 , anaesia green , 10 , and breya hammonds , 7.he slaughtered them , stabbed them brutally in their home in columbus , ohio in january.once sentenced to 12 1/2 years , he had 4 years shaved off his sentence in two guideline changes.he also stabbed hammonds current boyfriend curtis miller who showed up while callahan was still in the apartment .
callahan was stabbed himself in the fight with millercallahan s mother said no one has talked to her son about what happened since he is in the hospital .
typical enabling mother and we have an enabling president.there were many witnesses and the children throats were slit .
they were in the first and fifth grades.in 2006 , he tried to call her .
hammonds said that he had beaten and choked her so severely that she thought he would have killed her if ( a ) good samaritan didn t pass by .
but he was good in prison and presented no threat to the public .
he s one of those low level offenders obama wants free to roam our streets.no threat ?
he tried to kill her in 2006 ! callahan s idiotic mother said , his mother , however , said the murder accusations were out of character .
he wouldn t do that to her and her kids , she said.she raised a sociopath by making excuses for him.via : independent sentinel
