here s what we ve got with the new e-mails and it s a doozy : the internet is blowing up over a document regarding supreme court justice scalia.a new theory has emerged that hillary clinton and her lackeys are linked to justice scalia s death.tmn today reported : the theory comes from a wikileaks email from hillary s chairman john podesta to dc lobbyist steve elmendorf .
elmendorf was also the former chief of staff to democratic leader dick gephardt.podesta writes , didn t think wet works meant pool parties at the vineyard .
elmendrof responds , i am all in sounds like it will be a bad nite , we all need to buckle up and double down the theory goes that podesta s use of wet work implies an assassination .
and the references to pool and vineyard refer to the cibolo creek ranch where scalia s body was found .
the ranch does have a pool and it is believed that a vineyard is just down the road .
the email was also written just four days before scalia was found dead on february 13 , 2016.via : gp
