Just when you thought only Muslim terrorists teach their kids to use violence against anyone who doesn t agree with them Along comes the hateful American Left.
What these poor misguided parents have clearly missed is how many Latino s don t support amnesty for people who ve illegally crossed our borders It seems like plenty of people have wanted to take a bat to Donald Trump s head this year, and last night in Oregon, some kids finally had the chance with a pi ata shaped like the Republican presidential candidate.At the grand opening for El Diablito, a food cart in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday, a group of predominately of children and Latinos took turns hitting a candy-filled Trump pi ata with a baseball bat.The group had some choice words as they took swings at the life-size presidential candidate figure, which had Trump posing with his mouth open and his middle fingers raised.
I want to kill him, one child said as he watched someone hit the pi ata.One woman eagerly smashed the pi ata as she hit it several times.
Because f*** Trump, she said when asked why she wanted a turn.
I m sorry I know there are kids here, but he really sucks that hard.
Another man took several swings at the pi ata as he spoke about why he didn t believe that Trump should be elected.
You re bringing hate and we don t want you as a president, the man said as he hit the figure.The owner of El Diablito said, however, that the Donald Trump pi ata had nothing to do with politics, and was instead a way of bringing people to his food truck s grad opening.
It has nothing to do about politics, actually, he said.
It s about having a good time.
I figured that would be the best character for everybody to be excited to take a hit at, he added.
It s all about popularity and he s at the top of it right now A video of the event concludes with a little girl smashing the body off of the pi ata and a man holding the Trump figure s head by the hair as its body likes broken on the ground.Via: UK Daily Mail
