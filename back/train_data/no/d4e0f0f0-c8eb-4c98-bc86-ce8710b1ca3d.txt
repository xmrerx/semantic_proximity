yendi guadalupe torres castellanos , a prosecutor in the state of veracruz whose remit included violence against women as well as sexual and family-related crimes , was killed monday in her car in the city of panuco , according to the state government .
this murder demonstrates once more the troubling level of violence that devastates mexico , including violence against human rights defenders , the eu s mexican delegation said in a joint statement with swiss and norwegian ambassadors .
earlier this month , unknown gunmen shot dead silvestre de la toba , the head of the baja california sur state human rights commission .
and , after a spate of killings of reporters , a united nations team of experts on freedom of expression is currently visiting mexico to assess the safety of journalists .
torres death was also denounced by the veracruz government , the u.n. commission on human rights and the u.s. ambassador to mexico .
october was the most violent since the mexican government began tracking such crimes two decades ago .
the 2,735 homicides of women last year was the second-highest figure of any year since 1990 , and more than double the number recorded a decade ago , according to data published by mexico s national statistics agency .
