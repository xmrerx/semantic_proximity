We have some bad news for Charles Koch: Hillary Clinton just isn t that into you.
Recently, the evil billionaire backer of the Tea Party announced that Republicans are so terrible, he is forced to admit that Hillary Clinton is possibly better than all of them.
Koch told ABC s This Week that Clinton s husband was a much better President in terms of government spending than was George W. Bush, who is idolized by many conservatives.
In some ways.
In other ways, I mean he wasn t an exemplar.
But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was 2.5 times under Bush than it was under Clinton, Koch said, explaining that for Hillary to be a better President than the entire Republican field, she would have to be a gigantic hypocrite who can be bought and sold like everyone else they back.
Asked if he would support her campaign for President, Koch said: We would have to believe her actions would be quite different from her rhetoric, let me put it that way.
While Koch is in love with Clinton as anyone on the Right is going to get, he probably should not expect much from her.
On Sunday, Clinton let the Koch brothers know what she thinks of them and their money by essentially telling Charles to go f*ck himself.Referencing the Kochs climate denial and attempts to suppress minority voters, Clinton explained that she could not accept an endorsement from someone so evil.
Not interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote, she said, linking the interview.Yes, it s no secret that the Republican field is chock-full of terribleness, but Koch is almost certainly not going to find any friends among Democrats these days.
It s far, far too late for that.Watch the interview below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvqf3mSz8yQFeatured image via Getty Images (John Moore)/screengrab
