trump continues to stump the pundits .
so much for conventional political wisdom for all the talk about donald trump allegedly driving minorities away from the republican party , could he actually bring people in ? a surveyusa poll released friday shows in a hypothetical matchup with hillary clinton , trump is ahead 45 % to 40 % .but digging into the racial breakdown of the respondents is revealing .
for example , the poll finds 25 % of black respondents say they would vote for trump over clinton.how impressive is that ?
let s look at the last several presidential results for republicans.when president obama was running for re-election , despite a sputtering economy that was impacting blacks the worst , mitt romney was able to muster only 6 % of the black vote , according to the roper center at the university of connecticut.at the time obama was facing off against john mccain in 2008 , the republican received a measly 4 % , according stats from to the roper center.when george w. bush was running for re-election in 2004 , he only did a little better than mccain .
the organization reports bush received 11 % of the black vote , while in 2000 , he received 9 % .according to the surveyusa poll , trump would more than double the best result for a republican in modern american history.looking at the last 10 presidential election cycles , the highest black vote share for a republican was 12 % for bob dole in 1996.interestingly , trump is also outpacing romney s support among hispanics.the surveyusa poll finds 31 % of hispanics would vote for trump .
in the 2012 general election , romney received only 27 % , according to the roper center .
