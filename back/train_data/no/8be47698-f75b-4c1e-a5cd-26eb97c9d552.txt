21st century wire says one of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that donald trump had no support from women , latinos and blacks in the us .
as it turned out , this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal democratic mandate in america .
in the end trump gathered 29 % of latinos , 9 % of african americans and 49 % of college educated white women .
for months , mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for hillary clinton .
how could they have got it so wrong ? psychologist and intenet radio personality kiki green explains how blacks were conned into voting for hillary clinton by the partnership between the democratic party , hollywood and the clinton campaign by cynically using celebrities like beyonce , jay z and katie perry warning : adult language please be advised : support 21wire subscribe & become a member @ 21wire.tv
