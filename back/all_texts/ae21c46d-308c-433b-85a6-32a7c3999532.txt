Canada is going to miss President Obama when he leaves office just as much as most Americans will.But before that happens, the Canadian Parliament took many moments on Wednesday to show Republicans how President Obama deserves to be treated.President Obama was a guest of our northern neighbor to attend a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto to discuss the topics of trade and defense.During a speech delivered to the Canadian Parliament, President Obama spoke of the common bond between Canadians and Americans and envisioned the continued strength of that relationship in the future.
We see ourselves in each other and our lives are richer for it.
The enduring partnership between Canada and the United States is as strong as it has ever been and we are more closely aligned than ever before.
And President Obama felt more adulation and love within the Canadian Parliament than he has ever felt from the hostile Republicans who control Congress.Throughout his remarks, President Obama received multiple standing ovations and several chants of four more years even though he is restricted to two terms by the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution.It s the kind of treatment of the Commander-in-Chief that Republicans have refused to do themselves over the last eight years because of their open racism and hatred.Indeed, Republicans have never treated President Obama with the respect and dignity the office deserves.That was never more clear than in 2009 when South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson screamed You lie!
at President Obama in the middle of the State of the Union Address.It was a disgraceful moment in the history of Congress and in the history of the Republican Party.And while Canadian lawmakers would love to see President Obama serve another term in the White House, conservatives are paranoid to the point of stocking up on weapons just in case he somehow manages to circumvent the Constitution.
Hell, Republicans even refuse to acknowledge that President Obama is still the leader of this country for another six months.
They were already calling him a lame duck president in February when they refused to hold confirmation hearings for anyone Obama nominates to replace deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
It s like they believe a presidency ends after seven years instead of eight.Beyond that disrespectful treatment, President Obama has had to put up with unprecedented obstruction and racism from the GOP, not to mention endless investigations in an effort to find any kind of scandal they can make stick so they can discredit him.
In addition, Republicans have called him an arrogant tyrant and just about every name in the book.You will never see Republicans in Congress treat President Obama with respect and admiration.But the Canadian Parliament did just that on Wednesday to show Americans how this president should be treated.Here s the video via Twitter.They are shouting four more years!

His place in history is assured while Republicans will always be regarded as the villains against progress who kept him from being an even greater leader.Featured Image: YouTube
