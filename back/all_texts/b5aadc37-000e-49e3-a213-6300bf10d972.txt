There s something about these sassy ladies that makes you just makes you want to cheer for them The two ladies, Lynette Diamond Hardaway and Rochelle Silk Richardson, better known as the Trump-for-Stump Girls, have become a YouTube sensation with their hilarious rants.This weekend the duo was scheduled to go on MSNBC with Steve Kornacki but they were cancelled at the last second.
The ladies said MSNBC wanted to know where they live, the names of their children and names of their employers.
Then MSNBC cancelled their segment when they wouldn t disclose the information.
This set them off.At the very last second, he uninvited us when we wouldn t provide the name of our employers, and deep personal information.
Why he need that?
So he could do a hit piece on us!
So after dedicating 4 hours to be on his show, he cancelled us because we want to protect our privacy.
They try to spread hate about Trump at MSNBC, and now they try to do it to us.
But we don t play that game, we fight fire with fire!The two Trump supporters at WeBeSisters.com vented their frustration in a new video, MSNBC Screws US Over Because We Stump for Trump.
