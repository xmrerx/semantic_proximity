Donald Trump is a pathetic loser.Despite repeatedly claiming that he s a winner who never settles court cases filed against him, Trump settled the lawsuit against Trump University on Friday by agreeing to pay $25 million in restitution to the plaintiffs who were screwed over by his scam school.During the campaign, Trump vowed that he would win the case against him.
Clearly, he lied about that, too.
But he s already making excuses on Twitter.I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U.
Too bad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016Once again, Trump couldn t just let things go.
He had to jump on social media to whine and make excuses in a desperate effort to save face among his supporters.But everyone one saw right through Trump and mocked him.
@realDonaldTrump award -> fraud* Sahil Lavingia (@shl) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump Your settling the #TrumpUniversity lawsuits means that you committed fraud.

Swindling innocent Americans for Trump gain.
Apologize 4 #Fraud Todd Simmons (@Todd_SimmonsNYC) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump A small fraction of the potential award?!!
In other words, the suit DID have merit and you defrauded good Americans.
Atticus West (@AtticusWest) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump but I thought you never settled?
Nate Gilbert (@NateGilbert) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump Good luck explaining that to this guy as he really wanted to go to court https://t.co/Y20TlKzpcw Asa Bennett (@asabenn) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump Yeah.
You basically admitted to racketeering and fraud but wevs, right Donald?
Emma Kennedy (@EmmaKennedy) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump You would have lost which is why you settled.
Only losers settle.
Which means you re a loser.
Sad our president is a loser.
Terrence O Brien (@TerrenceOBrien) November 19, 2016Donald Trump would not have won these cases and he knows it.
That s why he really settled.
If he were truly focused on governing this country he would stop getting on Twitter to whine and attack those who disagree with him.
But Trump only cares about himself and his own image.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images
