WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday he hoped a government shutdown would not be necessary over his demand that the U.S. Congress fund his proposed wall along the southern border with Mexico.
At a news conference with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, Trump also said Mexico may pay for the wall by reimbursement.
Mexico has adamantly said it will not pay for the wall.
“One way or the other Mexico is going to pay for the wall,” said Trump.
Trump also said he would probably need to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement treaty to get what he considers a fair trade deal with U.S. economic partners Mexico and Canada.
“I believe that you will at least have to start the termination process before a fair deal can be arrived at,” he said.
