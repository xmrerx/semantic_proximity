berlin ( reuters ) - the german government could award a 400 million euros ( $ 465 million ) contract this month for work on up to three new spy satellites for its foreign intelligence service , the rnd news group reported late on friday .
citing security sources , it said the funds had already been quietly approved by the budget committee of the bundestag , or lower house of parliament .
the newspaper chain said airbus and the bremen-based company ohb had submitted separate bids to build the new satellite system called george .
it quoted unnamed lawmakers as saying that israel aerospace industries [ israi.ul ] may also have submitted a bid .
the new satellites are to be used by the bnd intelligence agency to provide rapid , independent information and threat assessments , rnd said , citing a paper from the chancellery .
it s not enough anymore to be dependent on third parties to generate data , to purchase imagery on the commercial market or to request it from international partners , the paper said .
increasing crises around the world could impact germany , and political decisionmakers expect immediate and valid information from intelligence agencies .
no comment was immediately available from the chancellery or the bnd intelligence agency .
