harare ( reuters ) - retired army chief constantino chiwenga and veteran politician kembo mohadi will be sworn in as zimbabwe s vice presidents on thursday , state-run zimbabwe broadcasting corporation said on wednesday .
the pair , appointed by president emmerson mnangagwa , were elevated to similar positions in the ruling zanu-pf party on saturday .
chiwenga retired from the military this month .
his appointment was expected as a reward for leading a de facto coup in november that ended robert mugabe s 37-year rule and brought mnangagwa to power .
it also adds to signs of a consolidation of power for the army since it turned against the 93-year-old mugabe .
mnangagwa has appointed several senior military officers to his cabinet and the ruling party s top decision-making body , the politburo .
mnangagwa is under pressure from opposition parties and the public to implement political reforms .
