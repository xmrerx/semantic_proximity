WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders at the White House on Wednesday, the White House said on Tuesday.
“The two will meet privately in the Oval Office and there will be no formal agenda,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
Sanders, a Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, is challenging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the November presidential election.
