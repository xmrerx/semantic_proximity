berlin ( reuters ) - a german court ruled on wednesday that a 96-year-old german known as the bookkeeper of auschwitz was fit to go to prison , rejecting his plea for the sentence to be suspended .
oskar groening , who is physically frail , was sentenced to four years in prison in 2015 for his role in the murder of 300,000 people at the nazi death camp auschwitz .
however , he had not started serving his sentence due to a legal argument about his health .
prosecutors said in august that a medical examination showed groening was fit to start serving his prison sentence , though groening s lawyer disputed that .
on wednesday a court in the northern german town of celle said : the higher regional court thinks , based on expert opinion , that the convicted man is able to serve his term despite his advanced age .
it said enforcing groening s sentence would not breach his fundamental rights and added that special needs related to his age could be catered for in prison .
in a 2015 court battle seen as one of the last major holocaust trials , prosecutors said although groening did not kill anyone himself while working at auschwitz , in nazi-occupied poland , he helped support the regime responsible for mass murder by sorting bank notes seized from trainloads of arriving jews .
groening , who admitted he was morally guilty , said he was an enthusiastic nazi when he was sent to work at auschwitz in 1942 , at the age of 21 .
some 6 million jews were murdered during the holocaust carried out under adolf hitler .
