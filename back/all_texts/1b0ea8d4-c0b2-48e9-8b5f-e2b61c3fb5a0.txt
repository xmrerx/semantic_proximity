When there are those who are injured and killed in terror attacks, there will also be those who stand behind them in solidarity to show their unending love and support.
No greater example of this was exhibited than on Tuesday night in London s O2 arena when Adele dedicated a song to the city of Brussels, Belgium and got the entire crowd to sing along with her.Brussels is the latest city to feel the sting of those who see harming others as a means to be heard and get their way.
These terrorists are cruel, yet unfortunately, no longer unusual.
Too many of these attacks are occurring and there needs to be a united effort to stop the spread of terror across the globe.One way to show these inhumane monsters that their terror will not affect life as we know it, is by sticking together in times of need and moving forward with a bond that is greater than anything hatred can foster.
By dedicating her song Make You Feel My Love to the city of Brussels and having the entire arena sing along while waving light proves that age-old saying from Martin Luther King, Jr.: Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.
Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
And this is, by far, one of the most perfect examples of such light and love.
At the end, Adele was so touched that she said, I don t think I ve ever actually been so moved in my life at one of my shows that was just so beautiful.
And it really, truly was.We re all standing with you Brussels.Featured image via YouTube
