And Sessions even got an inadvertent boost from Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who in demanding the AG s resignation initially claimed she never called or met with Russia s ambassador only for tweets to surface indicating she had, at least twice.Other former colleagues intentionally came to Sessions defense, backing the former Alabama senator s claim he only met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
I ve met with the Russian ambassador with a group, in my capacity, with a group of other senators, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told CNN.
That s in my official capacity.
That s nothing.
That s my job.
Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said in a statement that he d talked to at least twenty ambassadors in the last six weeks.
It would have been very normal for Sessions, as a senator, to have talked to the Russian ambassador without discussing the election, Blunt said.Sen.
Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on MSNBC that he d met with six ambassadors in the last five months.
Though he hadn t met with Kislyak, Cruz said he would do so without reservations.The statements of support came as other lawmakers including the two top-ranking Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schemer demanded Sessions resignation.
