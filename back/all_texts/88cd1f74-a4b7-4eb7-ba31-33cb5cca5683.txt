WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.
Ambassador to Moscow, John Tefft, has “expressed his strong disappointment and protest” over Russia’s decision to cut U.S. diplomatic staff in Moscow and seize a dacha compound and warehouse used by American diplomats, a State Department official said on Friday.
Russia’s moves came a day after the U.S. Senate voted to slap new sanctions on Russia, putting President Donald Trump in a tough position by forcing him to take a hard line against Moscow or veto the legislation and anger his own Republican Party.
“We have received the Russian government notification,” a State Department official said on condition of anonymity.
“Ambassador Tefft expressed his strong disappointment and protest.”
