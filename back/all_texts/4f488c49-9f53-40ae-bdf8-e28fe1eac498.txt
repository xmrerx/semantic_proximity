Ken Ham is a right-wing, young-Earth creationist lunatic.
EVERYTHING in this man s world revolves around the Bible and he wants the rest of us to be just as nuts.
On Wednesday, this idiot turned his attentions to the fact that the press has been covering the tragic death of a gorilla who was shot dead because a 3-year-old fell into his enclosure.
Proving that he is as heartless as he is crazy, Ham went off on the press for covering the story via his Twitter account.
Here are the unhinged tweets:In 5 days thousands babies murdered by abortion, 700 refugees drown, 68 shot in Chicago and a Gorilla dominates news https://t.co/Ar4gG2qgQv Ken Ham (@aigkenham) June 1, 2016We cannot impose human emotion/morality on a gorilla it is not made in the image of God https://t.co/Ar4gG2qgQv Ken Ham (@aigkenham) June 1, 2016That s right we shouldn t feel badly about this poor, innocent animal s death because of something written in a 2,000-year-old book and interpreted by a person who is arguably one of the craziest men alive right now.
As if that weren t bad enough, Ham took to his blog to use the bible to insist that he is right and everyone else is wrong to be concerned about the tragic death of this so-called sin-cursed gorilla.
He ranted: Because we live in a fallen world, sin has affected everything, including gorillas and three-year-olds.
Therefore when deciding what to do in a situation where a human being, made in God s image, is in the control of a sin-cursed animal with no sense of human morality, we must do all we can to protect the child from harm.
Sure, we have to protect the kid from the gorilla, but that doesn t mean that it isn t a tragedy just the same.
Ken Ham, you are insane.
Please seek help.
