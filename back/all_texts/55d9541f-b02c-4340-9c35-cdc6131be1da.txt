Former White House Press Secretary in the Obama administration Jay Carney is sure he knows who the president wants for his successor: Hillary Clinton.
President Obama has yet to hand out any official endorsements during this primary season, but, of course, like all major political players, he has his favorite.
Carney is sure that person is Hillary.
He said to Brooke Baldwin on CNN: I don t think there is any doubt that he wants Hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he s achieved.
I think the President has signaled, while still remaining neutral, that he supports Secretary Clinton s candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee.
He won t officially embrace her unless and until it s clear that she s going to be the nominee.
I think he is maintaining that tradition of not intervening in a party primary.
Smartly, the president is refusing to comment on what Jay Carney has said.
However, he s done all but given an official nod to Hillary as the primary race heats up.
President Obama will likely give the nod to whomever gets the nomination, as we all want a Democrat in the White House.
However, he wants Hillary to be that person.
That much is pretty clear.It s hard for anybody to speak for President Obama, of course, but his former Secretary of State seems to be his pick.
Hopefully, we find out for sure in short order, but it s pretty smart for a sitting president not to endorse one of his party s candidates over the other while waiting to see who actually gets the nomination, especially in a close, neck-in-neck race.
He must be pretty antsy, though, being unable to endorse right away.No worries, Mr. President.
The primaries will be over soon, and you can speak your piece then.Featured image via screen capture from Flickr
