Does anyone else get the sense Biden was picked to be the VP just to make Obama look smart?Vice President Joe Biden remarked at a Hillary Clinton campaign event Thursday that it s OK sometimes to be an uninformed guy who has no idea what the hell he s talking about.
Biden, however, was referring to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
I don t believe the guy s a bad guy.
I just think he is thoroughly, totally, completely uninformed, Biden said.
He has no idea what the hell he s talking about.
And guess what?
That s OK sometimes.
That s OK sometimes.
Biden went on to point out for the rally audience, for the second time in less than a month, the military aide who travels with him and holds the nuclear launch codes in case something happens to the president.
