While Trump is busy claiming that the real news stories are all the leaks coming from the White House, various staffers are so afraid of being accused of leaking information to the press that they ve resorted to finding ways to hide their electronic communications.
Some of them are using a chat app called Confide, which erases messages as soon as they re read.Some of these staffers may be behind some of the rogue Twitter accounts, like RoguePOTUSStaff and possibly AltUSPressSec tweet things that they overhear in the White House.
But there has been a proliferation of news stories citing anonymous sources within the White House as well, as staffers refuse to be named for obvious reasons.The funny thing is that use of Confide may violate the Presidential Records Act certain staffers are required by law to use their official email addresses for communications.
Using a secret app like Confide not only means they re not using their official accounts, but it also means there s no record at all.The fact that staffers are willing to break the law to avoid Trump s wrath is telling.And they have reason to be afraid.
Sean Spicer pointed at government employees as the source of the leaks, saying: When we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out, that undermines our national security.
That s a real concern for this president.
And Rep. Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, is more interested in rooting out the sources of the leaks than he is about whether or not Michael Flynn broke any laws with his communications with Russia.It s true that the White House leaks are unprecedented, at least insofar as one of George W. Bush s top officials is concerned.
Nobody knows where the leaks are coming from yet, but when you have to resort to secrecy just to avoid your boss wrath and accusations even if you re not doing anything wrong there s a serious problem.Featured image by Mario Tama via Getty Images
