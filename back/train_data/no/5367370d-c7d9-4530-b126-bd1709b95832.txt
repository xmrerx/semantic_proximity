washington ( reuters ) - senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley ’ s staff has indicated the senator is willing to meet with supreme court nominee merrick garland after a two-week senate recess , the white house said on thursday .
“ that obviously is something that we believe is entirely appropriate , ” white house spokesman josh earnest said .
“ it certainly is the most basic expectation that people would have for a senate judiciary chairman when a consensus supreme court nominee has been put forward. ” president barack obama nominated the centrist judge on wednesday to replace conservative justice antonin scalia , who died on feb. 13 .
garland began meeting with senators on thursday .
earnest said he hopes that , despite political differences , grassley will work with the white house to schedule a meeting .
