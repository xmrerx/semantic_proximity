Donald Trump shredded the First Amendment during his remarks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition on Thursday and made a total ass of himself on Twitter.During his speech, Trump said that America will only succeed if we have faith in our God and declared that Americans must be devoted to its creator to make our country great.
Unlike the Founding Fathers, who actually are responsible for creating the country we live in today, Trump pandered to conservative Christians by claiming that God created America.
On Twitter, Trump thanked the organization and declared that we worship God.
An honor to join the @FaithandFreedom Coalition yesterday.
In America, we don t worship government.
We worship God.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2017This is a clear endorsement of Christianity by the executive branch of the United States Government, which is a violation of the Constitution and the separation of church and state.The Constitution does not endorse any religion of deity.
It gives all Americans the right to worship whomever they chose and practice whatever religion they want or none at all.And Twitter users were quick to smack Trump down using the First Amendment as a club.In America, we have the right to worship or NOT worship.
ANY god.
Or NO god.
US isn t a Christian nation.
It is a free one.
Adam Best (@adamcbest) June 9, 2017This coming from the President is concerning to citizens who don t share his religious views.
Will we be unconstitutionally persecuted?
Adam Best (@adamcbest) June 9, 2017The common fabric shared by all Americans is no single religion, nor many religions collectively.
It s a devotion to our Constitution.
Tom Bonier (@tbonier) June 9, 2017No!

StevenBoyer (@SteveBoyer5000) June 9, 2017Actually we worship (or don t worship) whomever and however we please.
You should read the Constitution it is why we are great.
Benjamin Byron Davis (@Tooda) June 9, 2017Please double-check your copy of the U.S. Constitution, Mr. President.
