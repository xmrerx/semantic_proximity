clinton s radicalized rhetoric has championed both bans on what she calls weapons of war , and the australian model of gun buybacks under the threat of government force.actual weapons of war machine guns and selective-fire firearms have not been manufactured for the civilian market for 30 years , and can not be , due to the hughes amendment to the firearm owners protection act of 1986 ( fopa ) .yes , you heard that correctly .
despite serial lies by democrats and the mainstream media , actual military rifles are not manufactured for the american market and haven t been on over a generation.what clinton actually wants to ban are the most common firearms sold in the united states .
this includes common hunting rifles , target rifles , many popular handguns , standard rifle and pistol magazines , and if clinton follows massachusetts attorney general maura healey s deranged lead , could result in the majority of firearms designed in the past 100 years being banned.the threat of new federal gun laws is even more pronounced if gun owners unhappy with their choice of presidential candidates , opt to sit the 2016 elections out entirely , and democrats manage to gain seats in the house and senate , or even win majorities outright.in the 1990s and early 2000s , the brady campaign ( former called the national council to control handguns and handgun control , inc. ) used deep-pocketed gun control supporters to finance what was known as lawfare .
anti-gun attorneys would look for people to use as patsies to serve as plaintiffs in frivolous civil lawsuits against gun dealers , distributors , and manufacturers .
the goal of these suits were always transparent , and always the same .
these gun control supporters didn t really care if they won or lost their cases , or if their plaintiff patsies were ripped to emotional shreds ; their goal was then ( and remains now ) to force gun dealers , distributors , and manufacturers to have to hire expensive attorneys and spend hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in legal fees to defend themselves in court.plcaa was passed into law specifically to keep a handful of gun control supporting billionaires from bankrupting the american gun industry from top to bottom with frivolous lawsuits .
hillary clinton wants to repeal plcaa so that her allies , such as michael bloomberg , can then finance wave after wave of lawsuits to bankrupt gun companies with exorbitant legal fees.if clinton is successful in her goal of repealing plcaa which she could very conceivably do if she is elected in a wave that sees democrats pick up seats in the house and senate then no gun dealer or manufacturer , or sporting goods store , or ammunition company , would be immune to frivolous lawsuits , and all would be sued out of business.you would not be able to buy new guns , because there would be no manufacturers or importers after they were targeted , one-by-one.in many states where universal background checks are required , you would not be able to buy , sell , or trade existing guns , as dealer after dealer would be sued out of business.you would not be able to buy ammunition for your existing guns , as ammunition companies would also be targeted for extermination , as brady tried to do against lucky gunner as recently as last year ( only to have their case struck down by a judge citing plcaa ) .this truly is an all or nothing election , folks.if you own any firearm of any kind , for any reason , or ever want to own a firearm for any reason , electing hillary clinton is simply non-viable.i know that there are republicans , democrats , third-party voters and political agnostics who aren t thrilled with their choices of presidential candidates this year .
i m certainly not.i will tell you that if she is elected , hillary clinton will seek to destroy not just your right , but your ability to own , trade , and shoot the most common firearms in the united states.all of them , without exception.this includes your bolt-action deer rifle , your pump shotgun , your grandfather s heirloom revolver , the pistol you purchased for self defense , and the little .22 rifle you learned to shoot as a kid.consider yourself warned , and vote strategically to protect the constitution and the right to bear arms against the most dangerous and corrupt candidate to ever be nominated for president .
