Donald Trump thanked outgoing FBI Director James Comey for informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, but it seems that The Donald is lying.
The shocking firing of the man who was investigating Trump came just after the former FBI chief requested additional resources for the investigation a sign that things were not going well for Trump and his accomplices.
But you know what else is a sign that things aren t going well?
The FBI just confirmed that they are investigating Trump directly despite his claims to the contrary.An open records request from The Sparrow Project reveals that there is an active ongoing investigation into Trump.
The organization requested disclosure of any and all records, including investigative records, mentioning or referring to Donald J. Trump s statement on 27 July, 2016 [regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton s State Department emails], Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, and I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
The FBI dragged its heels on the request, prompting a lawsuit demanding that the FOIA request be fulfilled.
The Bureau had initially refused to confirm nor deny the existence of any records related to the request, but that changed in the agency s legal response, which confirms an active, ongoing investigation and says the FBI is concerned that any release could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.
It s worth noting that the requested records were not related to Trump s associates or Russian accomplices the request solely related to him and his demand that Russia hack Hillary Clinton.Things are bad for the Russia administration and they are only going to get much worse after Trump s attempt to interfere with the investigation.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)
