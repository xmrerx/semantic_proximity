ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran summoned the Swiss ambassador on Tuesday to condemn what it called an irresponsible claim by the U.S.
Ambassador to the U.N. that Tehran supplied a missile fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on Nov. 4, Iran s Tasnim news agency reported.
The Swiss embassy represents U.S. interests in Tehran, where Washington has had no mission since 1980, when Iranian students took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Iran s strong protest at (Nikki) Haley s baseless and provocative claim was conveyed to the Swiss ambassador, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim.
