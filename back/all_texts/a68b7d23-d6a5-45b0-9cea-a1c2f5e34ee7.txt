Trump influencer, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, is downright furious with the beta males at Saturday Night Live for mocking Trump (and him) during the cold open last week.
The segment took aim at Trump for getting what he calls information from Alex Jones and Jones himself for thinking that shapeshifting lizard people are an actual thing.
But Jones is most furious with Alec Baldwin, because of course he is.On Monday, Jones (who thinks Sandy Hook was fake) railed against anti-human scum Baldwin for defaming him (and, of course, Trump) with a comedy routine.
Naturally, his solution was to challenge Baldwin to a fight.
Alec Baldwin thinks he is a tough guy, Jones said on his show.
I challenge him a million dollars to the charity he wants to get in the ring with me, bare knuckle.
I will, I ll do it right now.
I ll get in the ring with you and I will break your jaw, I will knock your teeth out, I will break your nose, and I will break your neck.
You want to sit there and defame me and the president?
Jones added.
Get in the ring with me, I will break your jaw in seconds.
I will smash your nose into a bloody pulp, and I will whack your teeth out.
You frickin bully, you coward, the bully added.
I hate you, my listeners hate you and remember that, scumbag, forever.
Heh heh heh heh.
We re going to defeat this anti-human scum, we re going to wreck their world.
Baldwin had not yet responded when Jones later had second thoughts about his chances in the ring with the actor, who has likely received at least some martial arts training during his extensive career.
Jones said he was just joking when he challenged Baldwin to a fight, adding that he meant that metaphorically.
We are still awaiting Baldwin s reply, but we re sure it will be epic.
We ll update this when he puts the right-wing conspiracy theorist in his place.Watch the clip below:Featured image via screengrab
