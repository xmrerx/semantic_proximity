sydney ( reuters ) - the 600 asylum seekers barricaded inside an abandoned detention center in papua new guinea without food or running water are australia s shame , oscar-winning actor russell crowe said on thursday , offering to house six of the detainees .
for two days , the men in the manus island centre have defied efforts by australia and papua new guinea to close the camp , saying they fear violence from the local community if they are moved elsewhere .
the stand-off was a disgrace , the star of the films gladiator and les mis rables told his 2.7 million followers in a series of messages on social network twitter .
i believe i could house and find jobs for six , crowe tweeted .
i m sure there d be other australians who would do the same .
the stand-off has prompted condemnation , particularly from bodies such as the united nations , though crowe s intervention could spotlight the issue at a time when some detainees are showing the ill-effects of having no food for two days .
a spokeswoman for australia s immigration minister peter dutton refused to comment .
she said there had been no change in the government s policy of refusing to allow any asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach australian shores , and detaining them instead in camps in papua new guinea and nauru in the south pacific .
the issue will be a key element of talks between australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull and his new zealand counterpart jacinda ardern on sunday in sydney .
ardern has said a 2013 offer by former prime minister john key to resettle 150 refugees held in australian detention centers remains on the table .
crowe , a new zealand citizen who has lived in australia for many years , received the best actor award of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences in 2001 , for his performance in gladiator .
