mexico city ( reuters ) - a group of mexican opposition senators proposed a constitutional reform on wednesday that would enable a sitting president to face trial for corruption for up to three years after leaving office , in a bid to bolster the fight against graft .
mechanisms exist under the constitution to prosecute public officials , from senators to state governors and supreme court judges , via impeachment and removal from office .
however , the constitution does not provide for impeachment of the president and mandates that the incumbent can only be put on trial for treason and serious crimes , such as murder .
you can t even touch the president with a rose petal , said juan carlos romero hicks , a member of the center-right national action party and one of five senators behind the initiative .
the proposal sets out changes in the constitution that would allow a serving president to be impeached and face trial for acts of corruption and other crimes .
the president would also be liable for any crimes committed in office for up to three years after leaving the job .
public discontent over corruption has become a major issue in the run-up to the july 2018 presidential election .
graft scandals within the ruling institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) , and allegations of conflict of interest surrounding president enrique pena nieto and several top aides , have battered the credibility of mexico s highest office .
those in favor of preserving existing protections argue they are necessary to prevent political witch-hunts after changes of power in mexico , where the president can not seek re-election .
the pri is the strongest party in congress , making the proposal unlikely to prosper without support across the aisle .
