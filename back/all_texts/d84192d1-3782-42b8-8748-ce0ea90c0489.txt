After the nation joined together and demanded a special prosecutor for the Trump/Russia investigation, it happened.Former FBI director Robert Mueller was the second-longest running in history, serving between 2001 and 2013 two years longer than the typical 10-year tenure for his position.
My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that prosecution is warranted, Deputy Atty.
Gen. Rod Rosenstein, on whom Trump attempted to blame FBI Director James Comey s firing, said of his decision to appoint special counsel.
I have made no such determination.
Rosenstein says that based on the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.
During his time as FBI director, Mueller taught his agents that main stream [sic] Muslims are radical and that the more devout a Muslim is the more likely he his to be violent a view shared by the majority of Republicans.Ultimately, Mueller reports to Rosenstein, who reports to Jeff Sessions, who reports to Donald Trump, but this is the absolute best-case scenario we can hope for in the swampful of corruption that is the Trump administration.It remains to be seen if Mueller, whose conduct as director was called appalling and disgraceful, will be working for the American people or if this is just part of the show.Featured image via screengrab
