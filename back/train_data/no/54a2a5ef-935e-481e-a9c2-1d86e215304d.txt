@ ivankatrump will lead the u.s. delegation to india this fall , supporting women s entrepreneurship globally. # ges2017 @ narendramodi donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) august 10 , 2017go figure , americans are not the least bit impressed that a handbag designer with zero qualifications who was neither elected nor appointed will be serving in this role .
twitter users wasted no time telling trump all about it.yeah , just send your daughter , who has no experience in such to do this .
i mean what could possibly go wrong , right ?
