advocates for big government and progressive power are using the justice department to extort money from corporations .
it s a shakedown .
it s corrupt , pure and simple .
tom fitton , judicial watchhere s how it works : remember when big banks were sued by the feds for supposed mortgage abuse or discrimination ?
the government basically extorted money from the banks and then incentivized the banks to settle by giving the money to third-party organizations .
how convenient , right ?
it was a way to redistribute billions to radical organizations like la raza ! so far , investigators have accounted for $ 3 billion paid to non-victim entities .
the underlying problem with the slush funds is we don t know exactly where the money is going .
using enforcement authority to go after corporate defendants , doj bureaucrats are taking billions away from taxpayers to fund their pet projects overriding congressional preferences .

somebody out to go to prison for this !
