Earlier this month, a sinkhole opened up outside of Donald Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and that happened just after the alleged president placed his tiny hands on a glowing globe, along with Saudi Leaders.
Then, last night red lights began illuminating from the White House for almost 20 minutes starting at about 8:30 p.m. TV cameras caught footage of the phenomena.Watch:Red lights flashing at the White House.
What's going on?
We're checking on it .

It s possible the strobes were sent in Morse code as a scream for help, but on the other hand, Melania might be in New York City so who knows because the Secret Service offered no comment on the cause of the strobing red lights.Here s another view via Fox 5 Atlanta: One Twitter user wondered if the former reality show star stole the orb.
@Breaking911 Did Trump steal the orb?

@Mess_OfMe @cheerymonkey @PiinkyPants1 @FOX35Tom @WhiteHouse It the overheat warning light on Jared's shredder RunBeast (@RunBeast11) May 29, 2017Or maybe Trump ran out of Twinkies.
@RobbinSimmons7 @wsvn It's Morse code for 'out of Twinkies' susann g (@Susann_G) May 29, 2017Another possibility: Trump could be playing laser tag.
@RobbinSimmons7 @wsvn It's just Trump playing Laser Tag!

@FOX35Tom @WhiteHouse 2) They've fixed it so when Trump starts to tweet, lights warn the staff.

RED WARNING LIGHTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE MEANS ONE THING:IT HAS ESCAPED pic.twitter.com/O7PZf4kEmf hot weather takes (@paulythegun) May 29, 2017We re hoping this Twitter user is correct and the White House is testing out the Vacancy sign.
@FOX35Tom @WhiteHouse @Reince45 @realDonaldTrump #whitehouseflashinglights10) They're testing out the "Vacancy" sign, just in case.
RonEdens (@RonEdens) May 29, 2017Or this?

Not me, but many people are saying that.
Believe me.
@FOX35Tom @WhiteHouse Shit !!!
He is using the Orb pic.twitter.com/GoYj4ROQsq (@justin_C4se) May 29, 2017Another Twitter user speculated that someone fed Steve Bannon after midnight.Flashing red lights at The White House just great.
Who fed Bannon after midnight?

https://t.co/j7U4AHTOth Tea Pain (@TeaPainUSA) May 29, 2017Conspiracy site Infowars (I m not linking to them, k?
I just can t do it) thinks Twitter users are acting conspiratorial.
Because the Internet is totally not mocking Trump s insane administration, right?
Infowars says anti-Trumpers have been triggered.
Well, Infowars, you seem a bit triggered over people having fun.
Also, keep those apologies from Alex Jones coming that he was forced to make after losing in court over the conspiracy theories he circulated.We think it s a sign that Kellyanne Conway is crawling out of her crypt again.
