dubai ( reuters ) - saudi arabia will for the first time allow women to attend sports events , preparing special sections in three selected stadiums from early next year in another step toward opening public spaces to women .
the stadiums in jeddah , dammam and riyadh will be set up to accommodate families from early 2018 , said the statement from the general sports authority , carried by the state-run saudi press agency late on sunday .
last month saudi arabia announced that , from june , women would be allowed to drive cars , ending the world s only ban on female driving .
an economic and social reform program led by crown prince mohammed bin salman aims to open up cloistered lifestyles , shaped in part by a strict , conservative version of sunni islam that limits the role of women .
prince mohammed also seeks to diversify the economy away from oil as part of his proposed reforms .
the crown prince will be the first saudi leader since 1953 to hail from a new generation when he inherits the throne ; his father salman is the sixth brother in a row to serve as king .
the kingdom adheres to an austere wahhabi brand of sunni islam , which bans gender mixing , concerts and cinemas .
women are required to receive permission from a male guardian to obtain passports or leave the country .
some of the social aspects of the reforms have been criticised by some clerics and saudis on social media .
saudi authorities are also starting to reform areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy , such as education , courts and the law , and have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre-date islam .
prince mohammed told businessmen and reporters at a major investment forum last week that the country would cleave to a more open and tolerant interpretation of islam .
