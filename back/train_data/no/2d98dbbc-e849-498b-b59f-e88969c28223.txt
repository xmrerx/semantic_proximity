cairo ( reuters ) - egypt s president abdel fattah al-sisi will not seek a third term in office , he said in an interview with cnbc , adding that he does not intend to change the constitution and its provision of a two-term presidential limit .
it doesn t suit me as a president to stay one more day against the will of the egyptians , he told cnbc over the weekend .
we will not interfere with ( the constitution ) .. i am with preserving two four-year terms , sisi added .
however , he did not confirm if he intended to run for a second term when his current term expires .
sisi came to power in 2014 , a year after he led the military in ousting elected but unpopular islamist president mohamed mursi .
rights groups say sisi has since led an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents , activists and critical media .
he is unlikely to face strong opposition and many in egypt see him as vital to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy .
egyptian human rights lawyer and opposition leader khaled ali on monday became the first person to announce he is running against sisi , vowing to challenge him in the 2018 presidential election , provided he was not barred from the contest .
the 45-year-old gained prominence in january , when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two red sea islands to saudi arabia , a deal that had provoked mass protests .
