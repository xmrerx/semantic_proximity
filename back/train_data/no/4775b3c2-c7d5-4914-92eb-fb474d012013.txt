somali immigrant and minnesota police officer mohamed noor shot and killed a 40 yr. old australian woman when they arrived at her home to respond to a call she made about a potential sexual assault near her home .
officer noor has only been a police officer for 2 years , and although he is celebrated by the local mayor for being a somali immigrant , he is no stranger to controversy .
he currently has two open complaints that have filed against him and one that has been dismissed without any disciplinary action from the minnesota police department.many are struggling to understand why the 40-year old australian citizen justine dramond , who was set to be married to a us citizen , was shot in her pajamas after calling to report a crime near her home.zach damond , would-step , son of justine was interviewed a woman who identifies herself as bethany and then shamelessly went on to plug the women s march of minnesota before asking zach about his deceased mother .
zach , who is understandably emotional about the murder of father s fianc , tells bethany that america sucks and f * ck the police .
zach clarified his statement saying , some of you are good , but like i m just done .
i m so done .
this has to stop .
this has to stop .
