seoul ( reuters ) - north korea said it will release a south korean fishing vessel on friday for humanitarian reasons after the boat was found illegally in waters under the north s control six days ago , north korean state news agency kcna said .
the boat and its crew had been captured on oct. 21 and they will be released at the designated waters of the military boundary line in the east sea ( 38 39 20 latitude , 128 38 10 longitude ) at 1800 on oct. 27 , the news agency report said .
north korea had reached its decision to release the south korean boat after taking into account the fact that all the crewmen honestly admitted their offence , repeatedly apologizing and asking for leniency , the report said in english .
an investigation by the north had proved the boat and crew had entered north korean waters for fishing .
north korean fishing boats , because of age or low fuel , have been found drifting south of the maritime border between the two koreas at times .
most north korean crew are released to the north after interrogations by intelligence officials if they wish to return .
it is more unusual for south korean fishing vessels to be found under similar circumstances .
the south korean government could not be immediately reached for comment .
