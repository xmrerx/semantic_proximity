In 2005, Robert Slater wrote a book called No Such Thing as Over-Exposure: Inside the Life and Celebrity of Donald Trump.
It was a biography but eventually it turned out to be an example of how Trump resorts to bribery to rewrite his own public history.Donald being Donald, his own ego demanded he get involved personally in the book s creation once he was made aware of it.
He had to ensure that it was nothing but a positive story about him.Slater described what happened when Trump saw the book: He asked me to take out an anecdote that he had told me on the plane flying to Chicago about how he had informed his second wife that he was going to divorce her by announcing it first to the New York Post.
Greatest anecdote anybody has ever told me.
He put the newspaper down in front of her door that said, Donald is Divorcing Marla.
That s how she learned about the divorce.Donald was not even enough of a man to tell his own wife that he wanted a divorce.
He was such a coward and bully that he announced it to a tabloid trash newspaper, while publicly shaming her for literally the entire world to see.
How the hell will he ever deal with Vladimir Putin if he can t deal with talking to his own wife?Then there s that bit about the bribe: Trump promised Slater that if he liked the book he would buy a huge number of them.
This is how Trump operates.
He s so ashamed of his past that he offers money in order to whitewash his own history.Slater said that his publisher saw nothing but dollar signs, so despite his inclination at first towards integrity and truth, they gave in and whitewashed the biography of those facts to ensure a big payday directly from Trump s wallet.At the end of the day, Trump is the longest term case study for affluenza.
He was born a rich a-hole who just spent years growing bigger.
Given his celebrity, he literally globally shamed his wife at the time, then used money to avoid some of the consequences of his actions.Featured image via Getty
