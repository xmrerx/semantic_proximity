harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwean president emmerson mnangagwa appointed retired army boss constantino chiwenga and veteran politician kembo mohadi as the ruling party s vice presidents , a spokesperson said on saturday .
the appointments paved the way for the two to ascend to similar positions in government , officials said .
mnangagwa , who took over last month from 93-year-old robert mugabe after the intervention of the military , is under pressure from opposition parties and the public to implement political reforms .
under mugabe s 37-year rule political space was limited , with the latter part of his reign marked by the emergence of a zanu-pf faction aligned to his wife grace that threatened to usurp the army s central role in government .
chiwenga , who retired from the army on monday , is the latest in a string of senior military figures appointed by mnangagwa to important political posts .
presidential spokesman george charamba said chiwenga and mohadi s appointments as vice presidents of the country could only be made by the chief secretary to the government and cabinet , misheck sibanda , who is out of the country .
