brasilia ( reuters ) - the approval rating for brazilian president michel temer s scandal-plagued government has doubled to 6 percent from the prior survey , a new poll published on wednesday showed , as the country s economy continues to improve .
the survey by pollster ibope , conducted between dec. 7-10 , said the number of people who considered temer s government bad or terrible fell to 74 percent , from 77 percent in the previous survey in september .
that represents the first improvement in temer s unfavorable rating since he took over last year from his predecessor dilma rousseff , who was impeached for breaking budget rules .
brazil s economy continues to strengthen as it exits its worst recession in a century , posting its third consecutive quarter of growth in the third quarter .
the poll comes as brazil s congress heads into a winter recess until february without voting to overhaul the pension system , temer s top policy initiative that is seen as vital to fixing the country s finances but is widely unpopular .
the government has notched some smaller legislative successes , including more flexible labor regulations that came into effect last month .
in october , the lower house of congress again rejected corruption charges against temer .
