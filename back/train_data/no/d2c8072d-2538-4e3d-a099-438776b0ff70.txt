here s the video clip that captured hillary insulting and writing off nearly half the country .
and here s mitt romney s comments at a private event that was secretly recorded .
many will argue that his 47 % of obama supporters are entitled comment helped to sink his candidacy .
we actually think romney was unfairly targeted for these comments , because he facts and figures to back up his assertion .
barack obama was very vocal about the fact that all of america should be outraged by romney s insensitive comments .
will barack obama hold hillary to the same standard as he held mitt romney ?
you don t need to answer that question.here s obama s tweet from 4 years ago .
only 4 short years later , the same could undoubtedly be said about hillary s basket of deplorables comment.rt if you agree : we need a president who is fighting for all americans , not one who writes off nearly half the country .
