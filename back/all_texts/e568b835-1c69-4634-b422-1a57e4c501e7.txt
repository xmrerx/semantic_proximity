Donald Trump kicked off his Sunday morning by once again attacking the New York Times, one of the many fake news organizations he has apparently banned from his press briefings along with CNN, Politico, the LA Times, and Buzzfeed all organizations he called the enemy of the American people in a hastily deleted (yet widely noticed) tweet while allowing Breitbart and others to attend.Commenting on an ad the New York Times is running one with a message that the truth is important The Donald said that the bad ad is an effort to save its failing reputation, apparently missing the point that the Times (winner of 119 Pulitzer Prizes) is neither failing nor does it need advertising to save itself no matter what he throws at the news organization.For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation.
Try reporting accurately & fairly!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2017Naturally, Twitter was right there to set him straight on the validity of his attack::@realDonaldTrump the @nytimes was founded in 1851 and has survived far more than you can throw at it.

@realDonaldTrump Are you really telling the winner of 119 Pulitzer Prizes how to report the news?

@realDonaldTrump The "failing @nytimes" that gained hundreds of thousands of subscribers in the last few months Edward Hardy (@EdwardTHardy) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump It's not the first time the @nytimes has run ads.
They did so in 2010.
Just another lie & #fakenews from our idiot Prez.
Aaron Gouveia (@DaddyFiles) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Well, they are chasing a Pulitzer, along with every other news outlet investigating you and the Russians.
Joe Harris (@joeharris) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Perhaps you haven t seen a recent @nytimes stock chart.
They are enjoying a 52 week high, Donald.

@realDonaldTrump pretty sure you hate the @nytimes because their crossword puzzles never have "BIGLY" as an answer gigglechick (@gigglechick) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nytimes try giving your opinion diplomatically instead of attacking and attempting to take down an American business.
pic.twitter.com/g32ZWw2A2x AJ Joshi (@AJ) February 26, 2017In December, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that banning media access is what a dictatorship does.
Conservative, liberal or otherwise, he said during an interview while explaining away Trump banning media from events, that s what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship.
I think there is a vastly different model when it comes to government and what should be expected, and that s on both sides.
I think we have a respect for the press when it comes to the government.
That is something you can t ban an entity from, Spicer said.
But now the Trump administration is banning media from government functions.
.
Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller made it clear that Trump s actions are absolute and will not be questioned after judges killed The Donald s Muslim ban.
That paints a pretty clear picture of how the Trump administration views themselves as dictators.It is up to the American people to stop them.Featured image via Getty Images(Mario Tama)/screengrab
