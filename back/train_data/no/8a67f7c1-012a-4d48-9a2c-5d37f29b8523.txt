belgrade ( reuters ) - hundreds of serbian pensioners rallied in belgrade on thursday to protest austerity measures introduced as part of a 1.2 billion euro ( $ 1.41 billion ) loan deal with the international monetary fund .
chanting thieves and carrying banners reading we are hungry , the pensioners demanded that the government and serbia s constitutional court annul austerity cuts imposed in 2014 and refund lost pension payouts .
the government of then prime minister aleksandar vucic signed a three-year loan deal with the imf in february 2015 after belgrade committed to austerity to cut its ballooning debt and budget deficit .
to secure the deal , in late 2014 it lowered public sector wages and pensions by between five and 25 percent .
as many as 700,000 people lost a quarter of their monthly income ... we ve been paying to that ( retirement ) fund for 45 years , hoping for a stable old age , said protester milorad pavicic , 80 .
about 1.7 million of serbia s 7 million citizens are retirees and the government spends 13 percent of gdp on pensions , world bank data show .
the average pension in serbia , a candidate to join the european union , is 190 euros , among the lowest in eastern europe .
earlier this month , serbia s current prime minister ana brnabic said the government will raise wages for doctors , teachers and army officers by 10 percent and pensions by five percent from january next year .
pensioners were also slated to receive a one-off payment of up to 6,000 serbian dinars ( $ 59.38 ) in 2017 .
thursday s protesters dismissed the measures as insufficient .
the government has yet to discuss the wage and pension rises with the imf s mission , in a final review of the deal this month and next .
the lender cut serbia s 2017 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 3.0 percent , citing a drop in electricity output in winter and lower than expected harvest due to months of drought .
