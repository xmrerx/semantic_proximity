WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Saturday that the next U.S. president should be the one to nominate a justice to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the death of Antonin Scalia.
“The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice.
Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” McConnell said in a statement.
