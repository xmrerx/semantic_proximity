MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday dismissed allegations that Moscow had fomented separatist sentiment in Spain s Catalonia as hysteria, the Interfax news agency reported.
Spanish ministers said on Monday they believed Russian-based groups used online social media to heavily promote Catalonia s independence referendum last month in an attempt to destabilize Spain.
