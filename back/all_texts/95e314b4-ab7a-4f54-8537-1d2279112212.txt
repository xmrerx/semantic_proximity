Have you noticed that Donald Trump s supporters are a bunch of thin-skinned bullies?
Star Trek and Big Bang Theory actor Wil Wheaton has.Sure, Trump fans are perfectly fine with spending eight years questioning Barack Obama s birthplace and calling him a n*gger, using words lime fag and queer and Untermenschen (we can t forget the alt-right here), and generally existing as hate-filled garbage fountains.
But whenever you point out that they might be a little bit racist when they call the President a monkey, suddenly you re the bigot.Wheaton regularly hammers Trump and his inbred fans on Twitter and he has been doing a lot of that lately:Nazi punks fuck off.

The racism, homophobia, misogyny, bigotry, and authoritarianism you supported is still going strong!

Unfortunately for them, they re dealing with Wil F*cking Wheaton:Stupidsphere: *proudly votes for a racist*Me: You voted for a racist.Stupidsphere: OMG stop being so hateful and divisive!
Wil Wheaton (@wilw) November 23, 2016This, as always, prompted the typical you voted for a criminal response, but Mr. F*cking Wheaton wasn t having any of that:No, I voted for Hillary Clinton.

Bravo.If you go a single day without doing something that makes Trump or his fans fly off the handle, you need to try harder.
The next four years are going to be rough, but it is our responsibility to resist this fascist movement at every turn if you see a Nazi, for instance, say Nazi.
Not alt-right and not (looking at you here, mainstream media) economically anxious voters.
Trump s fans are one of two groups:That s it.
Always remember that, and constantly remind yourself that this is not normal.Featured image via screengrab
