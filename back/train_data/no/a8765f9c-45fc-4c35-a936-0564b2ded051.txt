no barriers , no borders , we all just need to coexist in response to her call for no barriers , no borders , higbie said that perry should hold one of her concerts in syria and see how they respond to our culture : you might remember higbie from the time he was screeched at by a cnn anchor when he demanded the truth before accusing trump s administration of anything : a navy seal carl higbie was blasted and screeched at by a cnn anchor who was shocked that higbie asked for more evidence and truth in the trump controversy .
yikes !
she s got snowflake written all over her .
it s just how the left rolls you have to march in lock-step with what they believe to be true even if it s not true .
just go with it , right ?
we say not right ! shouldn t we ask that sources be exposed ?
anyone can say they know the truth but when they hide behind anonymity , they ruin their credibility .
the left just expects everyone to believe the many lies they ve been telling about president trump .
we re with carl !
we re not accepting any stories against trump until we have proof and know the source.way to go carl !
