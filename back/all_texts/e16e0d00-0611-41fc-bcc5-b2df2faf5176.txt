WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, signing executive orders calling for a re-examination of some Obama-era financial regulations, said on Friday he would have a major tax reform announcement next week.
“We’ll be having a big announcement on Wednesday having to do with tax reform.
The process has begun long ago but the reform will begin on Wednesday,” Trump said at the U.S. Treasury Department.
