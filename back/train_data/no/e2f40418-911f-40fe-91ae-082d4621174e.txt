cairo ( reuters ) - former egyptian interior minister habib al-adly has been arrested after failing to attend his sentencing in a trial over corruption charges , two security sources said on tuesday .
adly , who served under ousted egyptian president hosni mubarak , was due to attend the final hearing in april and hand himself over to authorities , but did not show up and had been missing since then .
a copy of the april verdict obtained by reuters showed that adly and two other ministry officials were ordered to refund a total of 1.95 billion egyptian pounds ( $ 109.83 million ) and were fined the same amount .
adly , who has denied the charges , is due back before the court of cassation , egypt s top civil court , for an appeal in january .
his lawyer could not be reached immediately for comment .
egypt s state news agency mena earlier reported that adly had been located , but did not disclose his location or whether he had been arrested .
a long-serving official at the head of egypt s feared internal security apparatus , adly was acquitted of other graft charges two years ago .
he was also cleared in 2014 , along with mubarak and six aides , of charges related to killing protesters during the 2011 uprising which had led to their downfall .
