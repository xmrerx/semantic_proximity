the disgraceful behavior of multi-millionaire nfl players continued last night during the national anthem .
players took a knee while others raised their fist.these pictures are all you need to see to make you boycott the nfl ! squandering the goodwill of fans by doing things like this will be the death of the nfl .
fans of all races support the teams year after year with their hard earned dollars only to see a sideshow of divisiveness like the sideline display above .
these players have a job to do and part of that job is to behave like a team .
they ve been taught that from pee wee football on up .
the old adage that there s no i in team still holds true for football and it should for america .
how can we move forward together to make america better if we re so stuck in victimhood .
everyone has their cross to bear and some wrong they wish to right .
every race and culture could reach back and be angry about something .
the big question to the black community is when is it time to move on ?
when will you take responsibility for some of the wrongs in your community ?
until you do so , your protests will fall on deaf ears .
what matters more than your silly protest is the serious and very real issue of black on black crime .
it s epidemic yet you ve all but ignored it why don t you try pointing your finger at yourself for once and get real about what s really wrong in your community.until then boycott the nfl
