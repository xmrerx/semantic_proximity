A federal lawsuit filed against officials at Dietrich High School, located in Dietrich, Idaho, claims that coaches and other staff at the school contributed to an environment of racist bullying, which culminated in the vicious rape of a Black teen by three white students.As KBOI reports here, 17-year-old Tanner Ward and 18-year-old John Howard, along with a third student who was not named, are facing felony sexual assault charges, after authorities say they carried out a vicious sexual assault on a disabled student.The three white students used a coat hanger to rape their Black classmate in the school locker room, last October.According to New York Daily News:A witness testified that Ward initiated the heartless attack and that Howard was the one who kicked the coat hanger five or six times while it was jammed inside the boy s rectum, causing painful injuries that required hospital treatment.The victim, who testified for the first time about the rape last month, told the court that he remembers the three students laughing throughout the brutal assault.According to the suit, coaches and other school officials created an atmosphere in which racist bullying of the mentally disabled teen was not only tolerated but encouraged.The suit alleges that football coaches urged other students, including Howard, to beat-up on the teen, claiming that it would toughen him up.
KBOI reports that the victim was made to wear boxing gloves, while Howard was encouraged to fight him bare-handed.During the incident, other students and coaches surrounded the Black teen, shouting racial slurs at him.
The nighttime fight, as it was referred to by coaches and students, ended when the disabled teen was knocked unconscious by Howard.This is just one of many instances of racist bullying described in the suit, which states that the victim was taunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names include Kool-Aid chicken eater watermelon and n r, over the course of several months.According to New York Daily News:Howard, who is portrayed in court documents as the ringleader in the merciless harassment, is accused of forcing the black boy to sing a Ku Klux Klan song he learned in Texas, called Notorious KKK.
Howard also encouraged other football players to join in on the vicious bullying, the suit alleges.The suit, which seeks $10 million in damages, alleges that coaches and school officials knew what was happening, but failed in their duty to protect the disabled student.As KTVB reports in the video below, since filing the suit the victim s family has experienced harassment from some local residents.
