Donald Trump s self-congratulatory ad to celebrate his first 100 days in the White House is gross enough to make you want to shudder and vomit.
It s full of Trump s accomplishments (there aren t many) and portray Trump in a light that is clearly not in line with his true character and behavior.If you ve been fortunate enough not to see this ad yet, you can watch it below if you want to ruin your whole day:One network has already rejected the ad and refused to air it.
After CNN reviewed the ad, they decided not to accept it because of the way Trump s team portrayed the media as fake news.
And as usual, Trump s team responded in the most childish way.
In a statement on Trump s campaign website, titled: Fake News Station Refuses to Run Ad Highlighting the President s First 100 Days , his team wrote this: It is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country.
It s clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn t fit their narrative, said Michael Glassner, Executive Director.CNN takes issue with the ad s message calling out the mainstream media for peddling fake news and not reporting on the fact that President Trump is making America great again.CNN has struck back, explaining their decision to keep the ad off of the network until the fake news graphic was taken off.
Trump s attack on the media is absolutely disgusting, and it s only helped them.
It s been proven that Americans trust the mainstream media far more than the President and this is exactly why.
We hope that more networks will follow in CNN s footsteps, because no one should have to look at Trump s lies.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images
