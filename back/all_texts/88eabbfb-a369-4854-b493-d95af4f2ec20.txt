MSNBC s Chris Matthews definitely didn t get a tingle up his leg when it came to Democrat Jon Ossoff.
Turns out he s confused over what Ossoff was selling Matthews said about Ossoff: I don t know what the hell he was selling.
He wasn t selling much.
Ossoff lost a race that was the most expensive House election ever to Republican Karen Handel on Tuesday night in a race Democrats hoped to turn blue as a sign of national discontent with President Donald Trump.
Outside donors from liberal states like California, spent big bucks to win this seat.
Donations totaled a whopping $50 million1Ossoff s loss has prompted much soul searching from Democrats, including the left-leaning Matthews.Introducing his panel, Matthews discussed the race, saying that he wasn t even really sure what Ossoff was running on.
It seems to me that there was a lot of progressive hype about a guy who wasn t running as a progressive, which is another interesting twist to this, Matthews said.
He was running on basically, let s get together and be normal or something.
I don t know what the hell he was selling.
He wasn t selling much, he said.Further on in the discussion, Matthews made fun of his panelists for the rapidly changing narrative pushed by Democrats in the wake of yet another Democratic defeat.
If it went for Ossoff, you would be jumping up and down, saying how great a victory it was, right?
Come on, you re smiling.
I know you re smiling.
I know how people play politics.
If you lose, oh, no, big thing.
if you win, yay!
I mean, which is it?
Matthews asked.Wow!
What an ASS!
He s treating his guests with such a condescending tone.
