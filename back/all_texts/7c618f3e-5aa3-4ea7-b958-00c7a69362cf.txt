Bill Clinton was in Philly today and got swamped by protesters holding signs about Black Lives Matter or Benghazi.
It was ugly but what was even worse is Bill decided to give the BLM protesters a dose of truth.
That didn t go over too well and probably didn t win Hillary any votes.
It was a squirm-worthy moment in politics One sign read: HILLARY IS A MURDERER Clinton got in a heated argument with Black Lives Matter protesters as he was campaigning for his wife Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia, battling the protesters over his passage of criminal justice reform.Clinton tried to address the protesters, but they continued to yell over his answer.
Here s the thing, I like protesters.
But the ones who won t let you answer are afraid of the truth, he told the crowd to applause.The former president noted that Hillary had nothing to do with his reforms, but defended them anyways.
Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this, because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence.
And how do you think those lives were, that mattered?
Whose lives were saved, that mattered?
One of the protesters yelled that Bill should be charged with crimes against humanity.
Ohohohoho!
Clinton responded.
I don t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children, a now visibly angry Clinton shot back.
Maybe you thought they were good citizens You are defending the people who kill the people whose lives you say matter!
Clinton continued to call out the protesters for talking over his answers.
They re afraid of the truth, he told the crowd.
They re afraid of the truth.
