The Clintons are afraid of the truth so be it!
If a special prosecutor is brought in to investigate them then that would be fine, right?
They have nothing to hide, right?
Just like Bill had nothing to hide with the Paula Jones case Let s face it, faulty testimony is their mojo.
They can t tell the truth because so much of their political career has been a lie!
