ERBIL (Reuters) - Kurdish leaders will study a western delegation s plan to delay the autonomous region s planned referendum on independence, according to a statement from the Kurdish presidency.
A delegation from the U.S., UN and UK, met with the autonomous region s president, Massoud Barzani, on Thursday with a proposal to postpone the vote scheduled to take place on Sept. 25.
The delegation is concerned that the timing of the vote could disrupt the coalition s drive against Islamic State.
But hours later at a pro-referendum rally in Zakho, Barzani told those gathered that they would vote on Sept. 25 as planned, according to local media.
