Sheriff Clarke has it right!
The NFL wasn t listening to fans a year ago and they re still not listening.
As the league sinks lower and lower in ratings, the powers-that-be have just doubled down and said they have no plans to mandate that players stand for our anthem.
Clarke says that this latest announcement kicks sand in the face of fans We have to say he s right: @SheriffClarke"The #NFL continues to kick sand in the face of its fans"#NationalAnthemProtests#BoycottNFL #ColinKaepernick#NoFansLeft pic.twitter.com/CpIUVADk03 TRUMP ANOMALY (@ANOMALY1) October 14, 2017New York Post reported:The NFL said on Friday it has no plans to mandate players stand for the US national anthem, but will rather present a possible solution for how to end the controversial protests when it meets with team owners next week.Commissioner Roger Goodell, along with the head of the NFL Players Association, will meet with the owners Oct. 17-18 in New York, where the issue of player protests during the national anthem is expected to command much attention.
