BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. recognition that Jerusalem is Israel s capital would be important for Israel even if it delayed moving its embassy there, Israel s minister for public security, Gilad Erdan said on Wednesday.
This declaration is very important for us, but we only see it as a reflection of what is happening on the ground in reality, no game-changer, Erdan told reporters in Brussels.
In reality, nothing is going to change.
We don t think this is an excuse for a new wave of violence and we won t be afraid of this, he continued.
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and set in motion the relocation of the U.S. embassy to the ancient city.
