Donald Trump cruised to huge victories in all five of the Republican primaries held on Tuesday night, racking up double digit victories in the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware.
While a triumph for the candidate as he moved close to the psychologically significant 1,000 delegate mark on his way to the 1,237 needed to win the nomination, he also made remarks that could foretell the death of all Republican hopes.At the end of a long, directionless, rambling press conference and victory celebration, Trump decided to unleash a sexist attack on Hillary Clinton that is sure to echo with many American women who have been put down in the workplace.Donald Trump: "If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote."

He added, women don t like Hillary.
In fact, polls have shown that it is Trump s historic unpopularity with especially women voters, thanks to his long track record of sexist, misogynistic, and insulting attacks on women like Megyn Kelly and Rosie O Donnell, that have Clinton well-positioned to beat him.Chris Christie s wife, Mary Pat, grimaced as Trump made his sexist attack:Mary Pat Christie made this face behind Trump after his comments about Clinton and the woman card pic.twitter.com/oIxm9XRp2d Tal Kopan (@TalKopan) April 27, 2016Earlier in the evening, Clinton responded to Trump s previous whining that her candidacy was based on playing the woman card, telling her supporters to raucous applause: Deal me in.
The Republican Party was already in trouble with female voters before they were saddled with a nominee like Donald Trump.
The party has lost the female vote in every presidential election since 1992, losing that key demographic even when they have won the overall election.The party has tried to keep its positions that are unpopular with women out of the public spotlight, preferring to fight against abortion and birth control at the state level, rather than nationally.
But with a female candidate the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, along with a slate of women nominees running for Senate seats across the country, this could turn out to be a nightmare of epic proportions for the GOP.Featured image via Twitter
