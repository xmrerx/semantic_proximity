will you accept the results of december 21 if the pro-independence camp wins ? , he asked after supporters chanted puigdemont , our president during a speech to unveil his list of candidates for the vote .
do you commit to ending ( direct rule ) if that is the result ?
said puigdemont , the public face of the move for independence who is wanted in spain for rebellion and sedition .
after dissolving catalonia s parliament and sacking theregional government in response to the region declaring itself independent on oct. 27 , spanish prime minister mariano rajoysaid a new election would be held in catalonia and called onpuigdemont to take part .
pro-catalonia independence parties are expected to win next month although they may fall short of a majority of seats in parliament needed to revive the secession campaign , polls show .
on december 21 we must tell madrid , the eu and the tripartite support for direct rule that democracy in catalonia must not be undermined .
never again in catalonia !
puigdemont said from the town of oostkamp near bruges , part of belgium s flemish region that has its own separatist aspirations .
eu leaders are extremely wary of catalonia s search for independence because it has stirred separatist feelings far beyond spanish borders .

a belgian court has granted puigdemont conditional release but he is barred from leaving belgium without a judge s consent .
