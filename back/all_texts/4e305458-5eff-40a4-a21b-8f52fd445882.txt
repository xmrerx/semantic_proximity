Watch NAACP s Cornell William Brooks, who was at loss for words Thursday after he was asked a hypothetical question about allowing a Congressional White Caucus to be formed during a debate on CNN s Anderson Cooper 360.The racially charged exchange began during a discussion of President Trump having asked an African-American reporter from a black-focused new radio outlet if she knew the leadership of the Congressional Black CaucusThe best part of the video comes when Cornell William Brooks DEMANDS an apology from Lord for using KKK member David Duke to make a perfectly logical analogy of how dividing our lawmakers down racial lines could get very ugly if it s allowed to continue.
Frankly I used to think the Congressional Black Caucus, when it was first formed, was a good thing, Lord began.
I changed my mind on this.
I don t think there should be any caucuses in the House of Representatives that are divided by race.
I mean, heaven forbid, if David Duke got elected and wanted to form a Congressional White Caucus, that would be appalling, he said, explaining his change of heart.
Sir, Jeffrey, that is I m looking for a word here.
Beyond it s completely preposterous.
To compare the Klan to the Congressional Black Caucus, Brooks smilingly replied, visibly upset by the analogy his fellow panelist drew.
You would be okay with a Congressional White Caucus?
Really?
Lord shot back, interrupting Brooks explanation of the Black Caucus s purpose.
I didn t say that, was Brook s immediate reply.
