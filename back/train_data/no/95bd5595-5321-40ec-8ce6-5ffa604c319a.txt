mexico city ( reuters ) - north korea s ambassador to mexico on friday said its tensions with the united states were not mexico city s business after president enrique pena nieto ordered that he leave the country in protest over pyongyang s nuclear tests .
mexico on thursday said it had given the ambassador , kim hyong gil , 72 hours to leave mexico in order to express its absolute rejection of north korea s recent nuclear activity , describing it as a grave threat to the region and the world .
the north korean ambassador branded the move as ignorant and said disagreement over the country s nuclear program was an issue for the united states and has nothing to do with mexico .
that is why i express great displeasure at the bilateral diplomatic measures taken by the mexican government that claims to have a sovereign foreign policy .
that ( claim ) is without basis , he told reporters outside the north korean embassy in mexico city .
mexico has traditionally sought to steer clear of diplomatic spats , but in the past few months it has adopted robust language to condemn the governments of venezuela and north korea as they descended into increasing international isolation .
mexico s foreign minister , luis videgaray , has led the diplomatic push as he also seeks to convince the united states to keep the north american free trade agreement in place .
mexico s move follows a tide of international condemnation of north korea for repeated missile launches and the test of a powerful nuclear weapon in recent weeks .
videgaray on friday stressed that mexico was not breaking diplomatic ties with north korea , but that the country wanted to send a clear message of absolute rejection of the recent tests .
