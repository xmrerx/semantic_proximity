Hillary Clinton is bending over backwards to convince American voters that Donald Trump is a racist because a White Supremacist and a KKK member said they plan to vote for him.
]who eulogized KKK leader, mentor and close friend, Robert C. Byrd, and about the $20,000 donation she accepted from the KKK just this year!?
Here s a tweet from the woman who REFUSES to speak to reporters after being caught in yet ANOTHER SCANDAL.
This time, its been revealed that Hillary and her grifter and serial rapist husband have been selling our nation for favors through their pay-to-play slush fund, the Clinton Foundation (Criminal Piggy Bank).
Oh yeah about that tweet:It's not a coincidence that white supremacists proudly support Trump.

Quigg, the leader of the Klan s California chapter, announced last month that he had abandoned supporting Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in lieu of backing his likely Democratic opponent.
The Klansman claims that members have raised more than $20,000 for Mrs. Clinton and have donated it anonymously to her campaign.Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin disputed the grand dragon s claim and said the former secretary of state has rejected the group s endorsement.
