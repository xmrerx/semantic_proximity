it s interesting how the media has completely ignored this massive wall while making a big deal about the extra security measure republicans had taken to keep their guests safe you know , after radical democrat affiliated groups , like black lives matter and the new black panthers threatened gop members with violence to the democratic national committee elites , keeping average americans away from their convention is a good idea , while protecting the southern border from intruding terrorists , rapists and murderers is a bad one.the dnc has erected a four-mile fence around its convention site at philadelphia s wells fargo center .
( isn t it ironic they re doing so much to protect a site named after a bank ?
) the dnc fence , surely they would have built a bridge ! !
