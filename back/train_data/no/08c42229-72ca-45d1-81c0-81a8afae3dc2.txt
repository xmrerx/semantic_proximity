harare ( reuters ) - president robert mugabe on friday said zimbabwe will begin compiling a new voter register next week ahead of the 2018 presidential and parliamentary elections , in which the 93-year-old is seeking to extend his 37-year hold on power .
mugabe said in an official government notice that the zimbabwe electoral commission would start registering voters on sept. 14 and would end the process on jan. 15 .
opposition parties have been demanding a new roll for voters and have previously accused mugabe s ruling zanu-pf party of manipulating the existing register .
zanu-pf denies these accusations .
mugabe also told the central committee of his zanu-pf on friday that his party should galvanize supporters to register anew .
he said western powers were behind the last month s reunification of the main opposition movement for democratic change but added that the opposition would still be defeated by zanu-pf in next year s votes .
we know of course they are creatures of the west whose sole purpose is to dislodge zanu-pf from power .
but really , they come together as a bundle then one blow against a bundle will set the bundle in pieces , mugabe said to applause from zanu-pf members .
