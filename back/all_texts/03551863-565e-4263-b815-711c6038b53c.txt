On Wednesday, the GOP in an effort to deflect from the fact that they have failed multiple times to come up with an acceptable alternative to Obamacare began rage-tweeting Democrats demanding that they supply them with a workable plan.
This, of course, is despite Republicans decision to shut Democrats entirely out of the process while they came up with their terrible replacement for the Affordable care Act.
We ve got to fix what s broken, the GOP tweeted with a two second video of Hillary Clinton saying those words.
Where s your plan, @HillaryClinton?

Where's your plan, @HillaryClinton?

Clinton s plan is still live on her website.
While it s far from complete, being a summary on a campaign website, it is a pretty good start.
She has also spoken in detail about various things she would do to improve our healthcare system.Americans, who have been kept in the dark about the GOP s various failed plans, joined together to roast the living f*ck out of the Stupid Party.Uh, the ball s in your court, GOP.
What s YOUR plan?

will broussard (@Jag_Me_Out) July 5, 2017She doesn t NEED a plan you asshats.
She s a private citizen.
The plans need to come from the party if NO who has no clue how to govern.

JB (@jennberg) July 5, 2017@GOP isn t smart enough to get out of the rain, Tweets this bs out while Trumps cedes leadership to anyone.
Vote these losers out pic.twitter.com/YdmZO3Xap4 Molly (@Plantflowes) July 5, 2017The GOP also demanded that Bernie Sanders who has presented a detailed plan for single payer healthcare and Bill Clinton as well as other Demeocrats (all of whom with the exception of DINO Joe Manchin have shared detailed ideas with Americans) provide them with the answers they are too stupid to find themselves.Featured image via Getty Images/screengrab
