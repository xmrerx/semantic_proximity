OTTAWA (Reuters) - The 11 nations working on a new version of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact have agreed to the core elements of a deal but more work remains, according to a draft of the final statement seen by Reuters on Friday.
The statement, which is due to be issued on Saturday, marks a successful conclusion to talks in Vietnam which at one stage had looked headed for failure amid resistance by Canada.
