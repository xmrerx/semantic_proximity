Now that the Democratic National Convention has rocked the house on its first day, media is reporting heavily on the power plays that were Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker.But overshadowed was a telling endorsement not picked up by the media.Al Gore, who served as Vice President under President Bill Clinton and subsequently had his 2000 election victory stolen from a partisan Supreme Court, expressed support for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton just hours before the Democratic National Convention.Writing on Facebook, Gore stressed his support for Clinton for her record on environmentalism: I am not able to attend this year s Democratic convention, but I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.
Given her qualifications and experience and given the significant challenges facing our nation and the world, including, especially, the global climate crisis, I encourage everyone else to do the same.
Gore became one of the last prominent Democrats to endorse Clinton, who clinched the delegates necessary to win in June.It should come as no shock that Gore supports Clinton over Donald Trump, who believes climate change was an invention by the Chinese and drilling in the arctic is A-OK.Gore remained honorably neutral during the course of the Democratic primary, insisting he would not endorse until a candidate was chosen.
It should also be noted that Gore did the same thing in 2008, and subsequently endorsed President Obama when Clinton dropped out, and Gore also skipped the 2012 convention.Tomorrow Hillary Clinton will become, officially, the nominee for President of the United States.
She now has the support of those who served before her Jimmy Carter, her husband, Bill, President and Michelle Obama, and yes, Al Gore.Now ask Trump who supports him.Mr.
Vice President, thank you for voicing your support for the next President of the United States of America.Featured image via Neilson Barnard/Getty Images
