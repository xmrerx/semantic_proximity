BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said on Friday it was clear that British Prime Minister Theresa May was more positive and result-oriented after she addressed European Union leaders over a dinner in Brussels on Brexit.
If somebody says that the negotiations got stuck - they didn t get stuck, he told reporters.
It s just that the negotiations have not fostered enough progress.
My hope is that, in the end, we will reach sufficient progress on all three chapters ...
It s obvious that everybody is looking for a success story.
Nobody tries to block the negotiations, he said, adding that there was absolutely no guarantee both sides would arrive at a deal by December.
