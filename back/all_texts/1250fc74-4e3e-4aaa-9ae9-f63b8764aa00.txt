If you ve at all been watching the news coverage of Donald Trump rallies lately, you ve likely noticed the use of an upbeat pop song from the late 1990s.
For some reason or another, the Trump campaign is using the Backstreet Boys I Want It That Way.
Well, guess what?
Just like with pretty much every other artist that has asked Trump to stop using their music, so are the Backstreet Boys.
They don t want to be associated, whatsoever, with his campaign.According to Steven Trachtenbroit, a publicist for the group: [The Backstreet Boys] did not approve this and we are not associated with the Trump camp.
That statement was issued on October 12th.
Yet, the Trump campaign can still be heard playing that song at rallies.
It s become pretty obvious that Trump has no respect for the music he s using nor the artists who created it.
This pretty much keeps in line with his inability to honor contracts and respect, well, anyone.When music is used, it gives the implication that the artist and musicians that created the music approve of the message being delivered by any particular candidate.You ll often hear Hillary Clinton use Katy Perry or Sara Bareilles, but they have both openly come out in support of Hillary, and clearly don t have a problem with the former Secretary of State utilizing their songs.Unfortunately for Trump, he s pretty much left with the music of Kid Rock and Ted Nugent if he wants to find music to play at his rallies.It comes down to asking permission and/or when asked to stop using music, to actually stop using the music.
Trump is so quick to sue, but doesn t seem to think the same rules apply to him.
This is yet another reason he needs to be kept as far away from the White House as possible.Featured Photo by Ethan Miller, Joe Raedle/Getty Images
