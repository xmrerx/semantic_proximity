donald trump s oklahoma campaign chair is a standup guy except when he s laying down with children , that is .
on tuesday , the oklahoman reported that state senator ralph shortey was busted last thursday getting a hotel room with an underage teen boy .
on march 9 officers of the moore police department were contacted in reference to a welfare check at a local hotel , lt. kyle dudley told the publication .
responding officers found a juvenile male in a hotel room which was also occupied by an adult male .
the circumstances surrounding this incident are currently under investigation and no additional information can be released at this time .
police thus far refuse to release a full report on the incident.shortey ( who is best-known for a bill that would ban the use of aborted fetuses in food ) registered himself and his underage guest as adults at a super 8 in moore for a single night , checking in on march 8 and out on march 9 .
it says two adults registered , the motel manager says at 12:20 a.m .
responding to a welfare check call , police arrived while the the two were still in the room and took pictures according to an employee at the hotel.no charges have been filed yet , but police are investigating text messages sent between the boy and shortey , who announced in 2015 that he was proud to be tapped to chair trump s 2016 campaign in oklahoma.this is something that must be embarrassing for shortey , who recently bragged that he had lunch with donald trump jr. : what was shortey doing with an underage boy in a hotel room after midnight ?
there s no way to know for certain yet .
but let s hope the child was not harmed.featured image via facebook
