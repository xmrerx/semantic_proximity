zurich ( reuters ) - the swiss government urged voters on wednesday to reject a campaign for a nationwide ban on face veils , saying any decision on facial coverings was a matter for switzerland s cantons individually .
but , in a counter move to a referendum to be held by 2020 , the government said it would propose to voters a ban on face veils being worn by individuals while doing business with federal authorities , including in immigration offices or employment agencies .
regulation of public spaces in switzerland is traditionally a cantonal matter , the government said in a statement .
so cantons should continue to decide for themselves whether to enact a ban on facial coverings .
in particular , it said it was down to individual cantons to decide how they handled tourists from the arab world who wore the veil .
in september , activists submitted a petition for a nationwide ban after collecting more than the 100,000 signatures required to put the proposal to a binding referendum .
several cantons have already taken a stand on the issue .
zurich , solothurn , schwyz , basel city and glarus have rejected a ban on veils , while italian-speaking ticino has imposed a ban .
at least two demonstrators who wore veils in ticino in defiance of the ban were fined 250 swiss francs ( $ 260 ) , according to media reports .
the parliament in st. gallen canton this year backed a ban on facial coverings which were deemed likely to endanger public security or upset the peace .
with an eye to the referendum , the federal government said it would also present a proposal to stop individuals being forced to cover their face .
we can not allow husbands and fathers to demand their wives and daughters wear a face veil , justice minister simonetta sommaruga told a news conference .
