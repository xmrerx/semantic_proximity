Donald Trump got to play make-believe on Wednesday afternoon as he went to Mexico to speak with President Enrique Pe a Nieto.Trump, who has absolutely no diplomatic experience whatsoever, apparently got cold feet when it came to his big, beautiful, great, wonderful, and spectacular wall he wants to build along the border between the United States and Mexico.It would seem the reality television star couldn t muster up the courage to demand Mexico to pay for it because Mexico s president said afterwards that he would never pay for the wall, and Trump, instead of saying that, decided to try to cover up the conversation by saying it never happened.Al inicio de la conversaci n con Donald Trump dej claro que M xico no pagar por el muro.
Enrique Pe a Nieto (@EPN) August 31, 2016Translated, that says: At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.
Hillary Clinton, clearly getting a kick out of all of this, took to Twitter and personally tweeted out: Trump just failed his first foreign test.
Diplomacy isn t as easy as it looks.
-HTrump just failed his first foreign test.
Diplomacy isn't as easy as it looks.
-H Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 1, 2016Alongside this:A wall that Mexico will pay for: a bad idea from an even worse negotiator.

It s not easy at all, in fact.
One person who knows this all too well is former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who has traveled more than any other Secretary of State in the history of the republic.
Her job was to be a diplomat at all times.So, if you want a person with the proper experience, you better vote for Hillary and not the schmuck who doesn t even have the cojones to tell the truth about what happened in a meeting.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images, Twitter
