amsterdam ( reuters ) - king willem-alexander on thursday swore in a new dutch government under conservative prime minister mark rutte , ending the longest coalition talks in dutch history .
divisive elections on march 15 eroded the base of traditional parties , forcing the need to work out a deal between four parties .
rutte s third cabinet since coming to power in 2010 will find support from the strongest dutch economic growth in a decade , at over 3 percent , but only has a one-seat majority in both houses of parliament .
dissent by any parliament member could therefore endanger the coalition s plans .
negotiations lasted 225 days as parties dug in over sensitive issues ranging from immigration and euthanasia to corporate tax rates .
under a detailed government accord reached earlier this month , broad tax cuts will benefit both companies and workers .
this should boost the spending power of consumers , while making the euro zone s fifth largest economy more attractive for foreign investors .
the coalition comprises rutte s liberal vvd , the centrist d66 and conservative christian parties cda and christian union , marking a steer to the right compared to the outgoing government of vvd and the center-left labour party .
the installation of the new government marks the departure of eurogroup president and finance minister jeroen dijsselbloem , who has said he will leave dutch politics .
dijsselbloem will be succeeded by 42-year-old christian democrat wopke hoekstra , while the former parliamentary leader of the vvd , halbe zijlstra , will head the department of foreign affairs .
another notable newcomer is sigrid kaag , a well-known diplomat who since 2015 served as the special coordinator for lebanon of the united nations .
