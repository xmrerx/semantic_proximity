(Reuters) - Parliamentary elections in September showed that Russians do support their government, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
Putin cemented his supremacy over Russia’s political system when his ruling United Russia party took three quarters of the seats in parliament in Sept. 18 elections, paving the way for him to run for a fourth term as president.
