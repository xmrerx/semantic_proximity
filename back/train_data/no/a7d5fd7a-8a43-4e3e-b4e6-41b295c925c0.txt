ankara ( reuters ) - turkey on thursday welcomed an iraqi parliament move to reject a referendum on kurdish independence .
the parliament in baghdad authorized the prime minister to take all measures to preserve iraq s unity in response to the move to hold an independence referendum in iraq s semi-autonomous kurdish region on sept. 25 .
kurdish leader massoud barzani vowed to press ahead with the vote , calling it a natural right .
barzani s referendum decision is a historic mistake .
turkey will follow policies that take iraq s territorial integrity as a basis , deputy prime minister bekir bozdag said .
the northern iraq referendum must be canceled , if not it will have a cost and retribution , he said , adding the move would erode the region s peace and bring security risks .
turkey has the region s largest kurdish population and fears a yes vote could fuel separatism in its southeast where kurdish militants have waged an insurgency for three decades in which more than 40,000 people have been killed .
ankara has built solid ties with barzani s administration , founded on strong economic and energy links as well as ankara and erbil s shared suspicions of other kurdish groups and iraq s central government .
iran and syria also oppose the vote , fearing it could fan separatism among their own kurdish populations .
western powers worry the plebiscite - which would include the oil-producing city of kirkuk - could ignite conflict with the central government in baghdad and divert attention from the war against islamic state militants .
turkey s foreign ministry , in a statement on thursday , said : we find the ( iraqi kurdish ) leadership s insistent stance regarding the referendum and its increasingly emotional statements worrying .
it should be noted that this insistence will definitely have a cost , it added .
we call on them to act with good sense and abandon this erroneous approach immediately .
