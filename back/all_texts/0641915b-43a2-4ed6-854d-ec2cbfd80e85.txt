As if Donald Trump didn t piss off world leaders enough during his awful overseas trip, he s once again threatening to unravel America s relationship with other countries by reconsidering the Paris climate deal.
But it turns out, Trump might really be screwed if he does this.Earlier today, it was announced that Trump would probably be scrapping the plan.
After word of this horrible news got out, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to act quickly and sent a strong message to Trump on Twitter and as a member of Trump s council of business advisers, this is going to be something the disgraceful POTUS does not want to hear.
On Twitter, Musk announced that he will bail on Trump s council if the president abandons the Paris climate change deal.
Musk assured his followers that he would do everything in his power to make Trump rethink this.
He wrote: Don t know which way Paris will go, but I ve done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.
When one of his followers wondered how Musk would react if Trump didn t take his advice, Musk sent a direct threat to Trump: Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case.
While the Tesla CEO has gotten a lot of backlash for his role in Trump s advisory council in the first place, it is somewhat comforting that he s using his presence for good in this case.
Musk has previously stated that he had joined Trump s council because advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration.
However, with Musk s latest message to Trump, there clearly seems to be a point in which he is willing to draw the line.
