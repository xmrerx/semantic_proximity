A Donald Trump supporter came up with the worst idea ever when he got it into his head that it would be a good idea to try to heckle Bernie Sanders at a Massachusetts campaign rally.
Clearly he did not know what he was getting himself into.The heckler was wearing a Trump shirt, and holding a sign that said Obama is as Christian as Bruce Jenner is a woman.
As he started being an obnoxious twit, interrupting Bernie s speech and making a spectacle of himself, Bernie pointed right at him and said into the mic: Here s a Trump supporter worried about Mr. Trump s money.
The crowd took over at that point and started chanting Bernie s name over and over completely denying the Trump goon s ability to speak.Waving his arms around and cheering for himself, the heckler was eventually escorted from the gathering by security while looking quite satisfied that he was immortalized on YouTube.After the interruption was over and without missing a beat, Bernie declared: I say to Mr. Trump and his supporters that the billionaires of this country will not continue to own this nation.
Watch Bernie and his supports completely shut down the heckler below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJD0yUgb4J4&w=560&h=315]Protesting during political speeches is nothing new.
Ever since Obama became president it has gone mainstream as a way to get candidates to immediately address issues.
However, let s contrast Bernie and his supporters reaction to your average Donald Trump rally.Bernie s people got a bit loud and drowned out the heckler while Bernie mostly stayed on topic without getting ugly towards him.
When these same things happened at Trump rallies, the interrupters literally risked their lives.
On one occasion, Trump encouraged his supporters to attack a black man, and on another yet another black man got ganged up on with Trump supporters saying Shoot him!
Kick his ass, and Light the motherf -r on fire!
