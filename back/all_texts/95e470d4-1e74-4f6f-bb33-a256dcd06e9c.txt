Donald Trump held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina on Tuesday night and once again his habit of simply saying what s on his mind led him to step in it.
He decided that, while discussing terrorism, to praise a man once called the Butcher of Baghdad, Saddam Hussein.Sweet Moses pic.twitter.com/fL1u9R6VXm Jim Weber (@JimMWeber) July 6, 2016While conceding that Hussein was a bad guy, Trump praised him for killing terrorists, a job he did well.
Apparently citing a Middle Eastern dictator as his model for combating international terrorism, Trump went on to praise Iraq under Hussein s iron fisted rule as a nation that didn t bother with reading rights to accused suspects.Moving forward to the current time, Trump said that Iraq in 2016 was like Harvard for terrorists.
Like many of his other speeches outside of those delivered with a teleprompter, it didn t make much sense.When Saddam Hussein was captured by the U.S. after the invasion of Iraq, he was put on trial and accused of the murder of 148 people, torture of women and children, and with illegally arresting at least 399 people.
He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to death and hanged.Trump has consistently made a mess of speaking about terrorism, arguing for waterboarding (which military experts say is a useless tool for extracting information and is considered torture under the Geneva Conventions) and for engaging in the barbaric practice of murdering the families of terrorists, even if they had nothing to do with terrorist acts.The Republican nominee has also played fast and loose with the facts on terrorism, blaming the Orlando attack on Syrian refugees when the shooter was a natural-born American citizen.
Trump has also been at the head of the line on the right that has blamed all terrorism on Muslims, and called for a ban on Muslim travel to the United States and a system to track Muslims within the United States.Trump s supporters have cheered on his advocacy of big brother, fascist policies, with some going so far as to refer to Trump as daddy, for the paternalistic world view he has offered many of them who are skeptical of a black President.In reality, President Obama has had more senior leadership within terror networks like al Qaeda and ISIS targeted and killed during his tenure than his predecessor.
In Obama s time as commander-in-chief, American forces killed Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour.Featured image via Twitter
