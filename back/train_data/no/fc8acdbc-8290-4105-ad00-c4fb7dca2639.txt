donald trump threw another twitter tantrum , so keith olbermann gave him something to really cry about.clearly , donald trump is scared that recounts in wisconsin , pennsylvania , and michigan will overturn the initial results of the 2016 election and make him a loser.that s why he threw another one of his infamous hissy fits on his favorite social media platform in opposition of the recount effort.trump attacked hillary clinton , calling her a hypocrite for supporting the recount because he was asked repeatedly whether or not he would accept the results of the election .
however , trump only said he would support the results if he wins.it was a nine-tweet rant that once again proved how unfit trump is to be president .
and olbermann absolutely smacked trump down for it.what , @ realdonaldtrump , was that bullshit from you this week about everybody uniting ?

you ve erased your dignity # getoutnow pic.twitter.com/drkuyxdtre keith olbermann ( @ keitholbermann ) november 27 , 2016olbermann even advised trump to dump kellyanne conway , who whines and commits hypocrisy every time she appears on the air.also , @ realdonaldtrump , get rid of this dolores umbridge of dc , conway .
she s doing nearly as much damage to you as your own tweets are https : //t.co/oiwzfr8okd keith olbermann ( @ keitholbermann ) november 27 , 2016hillary clinton and the american people deserve a recount .
and if that recount shows that trump actually lost , he and his team should immediately step aside .
and if it is discovered along the way that trump s team was aided by hacks into our voting system , every last one of them should be prosecuted for election fraud and put behind bars where they belong.clinton currently leads in the popular vote by over 2 million votes and her losses in the three states mentioned above were by narrow margins .
asking for recounts is perfectly legal , and in this case , very reasonable considering the fate of the free world and our democracy hang in the balance.featured image : zach gibson/getty images
