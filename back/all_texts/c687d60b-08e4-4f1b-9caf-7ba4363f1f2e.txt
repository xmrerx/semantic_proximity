What if 20 Million Illegal Aliens Vacated America?It s a good question it deserves an honest answer.
Over 80% of Americans demand secured borders and illegal migration stopped.
But what would happen if all 20 million or more vacated America?
The answers I found may surprise you!In California, if 3.5 million illegal aliens moved back to Mexico, it would leave an extra $10.2 billion to spend on overloaded school systems, bankrupt hospitals and overrun prisons.
It would leave highways cleaner, safer and less congested.
Everyone could understand one another as English became the dominant language again.In Colorado, 500,000 illegal migrants, plus their 300,000 kids and grandchilds would move back home, mostly to Mexico.
That would save Colorado an estimated $2 billion (other experts say $7 billion) annually in taxes that pay for schooling, medical, social-services and incarceration costs.
It means 12,000 gang members would vanish out of Denver alone.Colorado would save more than $20 million in prison costs, and the terror that those 7,300 alien criminals set upon local citizens.
Denver Officer Don Young and hundreds of Colorado victims would not have suffered death, accidents, rapes and other crimes by illegals.Denver Public Schools would not suffer a 67% dropout/flunk rate because of thousands of illegal alien students speaking 41 different languages.
At least 200,000 vehicles would vanish from our gridlocked cities in Colorado.
Denver s 4% unem ployment rate would vanish as our working poor would gain jobs at a living wage.In Florida, 1.5 million illegals would return the Sunshine State back to America, the rule of law, and English.In Chicago, Illinois, 2.1 million illegals would free up hospitals, schools, prisons and highways for a safer, cleaner and more crime-free experience.If 20 million illegal aliens returned home, the U.S. Economy would return to the rule of law.
Employers would hire legal American citizens at a living wage.
Everyone would pay their fair share of taxes because they wouldn t be working off the books.
That would result in an additional $401 billion in IRS income taxes collected annually, and an equal amount for local, state and city coffers.No more push 1 for Spanish or 2 for English.
No more confusion in American schools that now must contend with over 100 languages that degrade the educational system for American kids.
Our overcrowded schools would lose more than two million illegal alien kids at a cost of billions in ESL and free breakfasts and lunches.We would lose 500,000 illegal criminal alien inmates at a cost of more than $1.6 billion annually.
That includes 15,000 MS-13 gang members who distribute $130 billion in drugs annually would vacate our country.In cities like L.A., 20,000 members of the 18th Street Gang would vanish from our nation.
No more Mexican forgery gangs for ID theft from Americans!
No more foreign rapists and child molesters!Losing more than 20 million people would clear up our crowded highways and gridlock.
Cleaner air and less drinking and driving American deaths by illegal aliens!

Illegal Alien Crimes Committed In U.S.A. Statistics:CIS ICE continued to release deportable criminal aliens from its custody at an alarming rate in 2015, according to figures the agency provided to members of Congress this week in advance of a hearing taking place Thursday, April 28.
In 2015, ICE freed 19,723 criminal aliens, who had a total of 64,197 convictions among them.
These included 8,234 violent convictions and 208 homicide convictions.
While the total number of releases is lower than the past two years, since the number of arrests has declined quite dramatically, the rate of releases is approximately the same meaning that this is no progress at all, and certainly will be no consolation for the victims of these criminal aliens.The table below enumerates the criminal convictions associated with the released aliens.
The largest number of convictions was for Driving Under the Influence; there were 12,307 alcohol DUI convictions and 354 drug DUI convictions, for a total of 12,661.Convictions for Alien Criminals Released Convictions Number of Convictions Traffic Offense: Driving Under the Influence, Liquor 12,307 Traffic Offense 9,811 Dangerous Drugs 7,986 Larceny 3,535 Immigration 3,064 Obstructing Judiciary/Congress/Legislature,etc.
