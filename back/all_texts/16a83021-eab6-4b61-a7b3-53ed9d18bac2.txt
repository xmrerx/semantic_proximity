They say there s nothing worse than burying your child, which is exactly what Geneva Reed-Veal had to do after her daughter Sandra Bland died in police custody.
Bland was pulled over by a police officer for failing to signal as she changed lanes.
Hardly a crime worthy of an arrest, and most certainly not a crime worthy of a death sentence.
In most circumstances, an officer would likely give a warning, but in Bland s case she was torn from her car and placed under arrest.
Bland was later found dead in her jail cell.Looking at the broader picture of what happened when lined up next to a constant string of story after story of police brutality against people of color, Bland s mother Geneva wants change, and she feels the person to deliver that change is Hillary Clinton.In a verbal endorsement of the former Secretary of State, Geneva read aloud a poem she wrote about and for Clinton that states her many reasons why she is backing Clinton s run for the White House.Here is her poem:Now is the time, this is the place, Now we are ready.
Hillary is the face.
Why am I endorsing this woman to my right?
Because she has for years continuously put up the fight.She seeks to make equal pay for equal work a priority.
I don t know about you, but that sure works for me!
Here s a woman who has shown time and time again, She has the skill, experience and staying power more than 20 years in.Yes, there was Benghazi and the infamous email situation.
While both were stressful, she maintained her poise and dedication.
Dedicated to seeing mothers who singlehandedly raise babies Finally get compensated equal pay in this world that has gone crazy.Selfless in sitting down with a room of mourning mothers, Who have violently lost their children both sons and daughters.
Now this I know to be absolutely true; I am one of those who met with her and was able to make it through.She has a plan on gun laws that s like none other.
Unapologetically she speaks out about the NRA and issues of color.
Her plan for immigration is to keep families together.
She ll end family detention and close private immigration shelters.She supports the bipartisan U.S.A. Freedom Act.
President Obama signed it into law, and she has his back!
She has fought for quality affordable health care her entire career.
So she ll defend the Affordable Care Act and build on the successes of it here.She ll cut taxes for the middle class, raise the minimum wage, and ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share.
She ll invest in infrastructure and education.
This woman really cares.
I ve watched and followed her career, and saw her take hits.
Yet she still manages to stand here decades later as if it didn t bother her one bit!As Sandra Bland s mother, I know a little about frustration.
You have to stand and push through it, even when you want a vacation.
Like me, she misses the counsel of her late father, who told her always carry a shovel, So at any given time she could dig herself out of trouble.Like me, she lost her dad in 1993.
His wisdom played a big part in the strength she shows you and me.
I ve shared with you just some of Hillary s views, Now it s up to you to do your research and vote when you re through.People, we are expecting a new president in nine months.
Hillary is that new baby.
From now until November let s fiercely support this lady!I present to you, Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton.There s no denying Hillary s long career of hard work and dedication to those who have been oppressed by a system that seems to be working against rather than for them.
It s clear the Sandra Bland s mother Geneva feels in her heart of hearts that the person to move the country forward is the former Secretary of State.No matter who we choose on election day, we must make sure it s for someone who truly embodies a path forward for everyone.
A nation of the many, not just the few who were fortunate enough to be born into privilege.Featured image from HillaryClinton.com
