osan , south korea ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump landed in south korea on tuesday , the second leg of his 12-day asia trip dominated by the north korean nuclear standoff .
south koreans are bracing for the possibility that trump s state visit could risk further inflaming tensions with north korean leader kim jong un , who has stepped up his pursuit of nuclear weapons that could soon be capable of striking the mainland united states .
trump will visit with u.s troops and is also expected to raise criticisms of a u.s-south korean trade pact when he meets with president moon jae-in in seoul .
