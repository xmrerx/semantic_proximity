Donald Trump made a big stink a few weeks ago because it was pointed out that many of the products he has lent his name to have turned out to be complete and absolute losers, quickly discontinued and removed from the market.
Those products include Trump Water, Trump Steaks, and Trump Magazine.Buzzfeed decided to get in on the action and spent $200 to buy a bottle of Trump Vodka.
Here s what happened when they got some people to actually taste it:As pointed out in the video, the vodka from the man who has promised to make America great again in his campaign was actually a product of Netherlands.
This follows a pattern of several other Trump products, like his discontinued neckties, being sourced and manufactured in other countries (the ties were from China).
It shows that when it came to his own products that he stood to make a cut of the profits from, Trump was more than willing to make a deal to produce them cheaply overseas, adding to his personal bottom line.Trump said he got into vodka because A great friend of mine was a founder of Grey Goose and what we re going to do is to top it.
I want to top them just because it s fun to top my friends.
Despite Trump s grandiose predictions of success for the drink, it was not to be (sound familiar?
):The only trouble was, nobody bought it.
By the end of 2007 it barely registered among the top-selling vodkas, badly trailing the likes of Smirnoff and no threat whatsoever to Grey Goose.
Go figure that customers wouldn t line up for a product that existed for the sole purpose of one-upping Trump s friend.By 2011, Trump Vodka was gone.The reviewers in the video were not optimistic.
They told Buzzfeed they thought the alcohol would taste like self-tanner or misogyny.
While one drinker said it burned like a UTI, another said it tasted surprisingly good.
Another woman said it tasted good, but not $200 good.
