moscow ( reuters ) - a journalist became the second woman to enter russia s presidential race , saying on monday she wanted to use the election to campaign for the rights of single mothers and children .
the presidential election takes place in march next year .
president vladimir putin is expected to stand and win , but has yet to confirm his plans .
some opposition activists believe the kremlin s aim is to crown the field with candidates designed to distract and entertain in order to boost turnout and divide the liberal opposition .
the kremlin denies that , saying anyone who meets the legal criteria to run can take part .
on monday , mother-of-two ekaterina gordon , 37 , who has worked as a tv and radio talk show host , said she was putting herself forward as an independent presidential candidate .
she said she had never voted , but had become disillusioned by both the liberal opposition and pro-kremlin politicians .
i understood that everyone is fed from the same trough , gordon said in an online video .
there are many populist themes ...
but there is one reality - we are a country of single mothers , and no one gives a damn about them .
she said she had not agreed her candidacy with the kremlin and had experience of the kind of problems russian woman faced due to her ownership of a law firm .
another female candidate , russian tv personality ksenia sobchak , said earlier this month she planned to run for president , offering liberal voters unhappy with putin s rule someone to back , though she , like gordon , has little prospect of winning .
post-soviet russia has never had a female president .
kremlin critic and opposition leader alexei navalny wants to run too , but russia s central election commission has declared him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence , which he says was politically-motivated .
