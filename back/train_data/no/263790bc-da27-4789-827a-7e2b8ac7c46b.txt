vatican city ( reuters ) - pope francis and orthodox christian leader patriarch bartholomew called on friday for a collective response from world leaders to climate change , saying the planet was deteriorating and vulnerable people were the first to be affected .
the appeal comes three months after u.s. president donald trump withdrew from a global agreement , struck in paris , to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
we urgently appeal to those in positions of social and economic , as well as political and cultural , responsibility to hear the cry of the earth and to attend to the needs of the marginalized , francis and bartholomew said in a joint statement .
above all , the leaders of the world s 1.2 billion catholics and up to 300 million orthodox christians asked for a response to the plea of millions and support ( for ) the consensus of the world for the healing of our wounded creation .
the joint message was not addressed to any specific world leaders .
many were dismayed when the u.s. backed out of the paris accord , a decision a senior vatican official later called a disaster .
