Ammon Bundy and his band of gun-toting domestic terrorists are living up to their Vanilla ISIS nickname.As you ll recall, the international community has condemned ISIS for destroying archaeological sites and artifacts during the organization s rampage through the Middle East.
They are literally destroying history and heritage.Well, that s kinda what Bundy and his pals are doing now at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.In addition to being a wildlife refuge, Malheur is also a storage place for thousands of Native American artifacts, many of which are associated with the local Paiute tribe.And instead of leaving the artifacts alone and undisturbed, the tantrum-throwing white rednecks decided to search through the artifacts, thus putting them at risk of being damaged or stolen or destroyed entirely.The militants even posted a video of themselves doing this, and they accused the Bureau of Land Management of not storing the artifacts properly.Here s the video via Facebook.// < !

BREAKING UPDATE BURNS OREGON BLM LEFT NATIVE ARTIFACTS TO ROT IN MICE DROPPINGS!Posted by Bundy Ranch on Wednesday, January 20, 2016The Y all-Qaeda militants claim that the artifacts were left to rot in mouse droppings, but the video really doesn t offer much evidence of this.
Instead it appears to show artifacts wrapped in plastic and placed in boxes that are organized neatly on shelves.In fact, the Paiute tribe isn t as worried about the federal government handling the artifacts as they are about the militants handling them.
We are really worried about the status of the artifacts down there, said Burns Paiute tribal chairperson Charlotte Roderique.
The tribe has also demanded that any barbarian militant who even so much as disturbs an artifacts be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and they have the legal statutes on their side.According to Indian Country Today: The tribe delivered a letter to federal agencies including the U.S. Attorney and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service demanding prosecution of Ammon Bundy and other armed militants occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, If the occupiers disturb, damage, remove, alter, or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property.There are approximately 4,000 artifacts belonging to the tribe in the buildings the militants are holding.
The occupation is entering its third week.The tribe is demanding federal action under both the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and a protection against bad men provision in the treaty the tribe signed with the United States in 1868.Under ARPA, a federal law authorizing law enforcement and penalties in the defense of archeological sites on public land, removing artifacts is a felony offense.
First time offenders can be fined up to $20,000 and imprisoned for up to one year.
Second time offenders can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years.
It s not like the militants actually respect Native American culture either.
Not too long ago, Ryan Bundy said that Native Americans have no claim to the land and that current culture (a.k.a.
white culture) is more important.
We also recognize that the Native Americans had the claim to the land, but they lost that claim.
There are things to learn from cultures of the past, but the current culture is the most important.
In short, Bundy and his boys are acting like ISIS.
They have no respect for Native Americans or the artifacts of their culture.
By all rights, they should prepare to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, which they would have to pay from behind bars if the Justice Department actually did their damn job by arresting and charging these assholes as the criminals they are.Featured Image: Facebook
