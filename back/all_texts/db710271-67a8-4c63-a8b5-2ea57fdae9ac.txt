BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday he hoped to make progress with Germany on ideas to reform the euro zone by March, once Germany has a new coalition government in place, and agree a roadmap with all eurozone leaders by June next year.
Speaking at a news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel after an EU summit, Macron said a stable, strong Germany was in everyone s interests to advance European integration and that decisions would flow from that.
Our aim is to have an agreement in March because at that stage a political step will have been completed in Germany and we will have the capacity to construct together much more clearly on these issues, Macron said of eurozone reform.
Do I think that we can have a joint position and have joint solutions?
I not only think we can, but I want it.
Asked about his ideas for a eurozone budget, Macron said that in his Sorbonne speech in September, delivered two days after the German election, he had not made any mention of a specific size for the budget in terms of points of GDP.
