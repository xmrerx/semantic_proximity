The couple had met in the early 1990s on a folklore-themed online message board, and married before setting up the site.Profiles of the website disclose that for some time before it was set up, the couple had posed as The San Fernardo Valley Folklore Society , using its name on letterheads, even though it did not exist.A profile for the Webby Awards published in October describes it as an entity dreamed up to help make the inquiries seem more legit .David Mikkeleson told the Los Angeles Times in 1997: When I sent letters out to companies, I found I got a much better response with an official-looking organization s stationery.
In 2015, their marriage ended in divorce but a bitter legal dispute continues.Both stayed on as co-owners of Snopes which is registered under its legal name of Bardav, Inc. and were its sole board members.Legal filings seen by DailyMail.com detail a lengthy financial and corporate dispute which stretches long after their divorce, and which one lawyer describes as contentious in court documents.In the filings, Barbara, 57, has accused her former husband, 56, of raiding the corporate business Bardav bank account for his personal use and attorney fees without consulting her.She also claimed he embezzled $98,000 from the company over the course of four years which he expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired .When contacted by the Dailymail.com, David said he was legally prohibited from discussing his ex-wife s allegations.
I d love to respond, but unfortunately the terms of a binding settlement agreement preclude me from publicly discussing the details of our divorce, he said.
Barbara Mikkelson said: No comment.
In court records, Barbara alleged that her ex-husband removed thousands from their business accounts between April and June of 2016 to pay for trips for him and his girlfriend .One of the lead fact-checkers, Kim LaCapria, has also been a sex-and-fetish blogger who went by the pseudonym Vice Vixen.
She described her blog as a lifestyle website with a specific focus on naughtiness, sin, carnal pursuits, and general hedonism and bonne vivante-ery.
She regularly provided intimate advice and reviewed sex toys, including a vibrating wand that drives boys mad.
If you are doing something to your fella, and you apply this to the base of his cash-and-prizes while you carry on, he will scream and perhaps cry, she wrote.She also recommended one book with the review: How to Tell A Naked Man What To Do seems like the perfect how-to for the dominatrix-in-waiting, or any girl looking to get in touch with her domme side.
Mine, I wish I could shut her up sometimes, but there you go.
In others posts, LaCapria claimed to be addicted to smutty HP [Harry Potter] fanfic.
Describing her day-off activities on another blog, she wrote that she played scrabble, smoked pot, and posted to Snopes.
She added, That s what I did on my day on, too.
David Mikkelson told the Dailymail.com that Snopes does not have a standardized procedure for fact-checking since the nature of this material can vary widely.
He said the process involves multiple stages of editorial oversight, so no output is the result of a single person s discretion.
He also said the company has no set requirements for fact-checkers because the variety of the work would be difficult to encompass in any single blanket set of standards.
Accordingly, our editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds; some of them have degrees and/or professional experience in journalism, and some of them don t, he added.For entire story- Daily Mail
