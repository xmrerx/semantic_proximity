brasilia ( reuters ) - a majority of the judges on brazil s supreme court voted on wednesday to send new graft charges against president michel temer to the lower house of congress , which must authorize any trial of a sitting president .
last month , temer s allies in congress blocked the first corruption charge against the president , saving him from facing a possible supreme court trial that could have ousted him from office .
