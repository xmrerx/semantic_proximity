Bette Midler has made her distaste for the GOP s 2016 Clown Car perfectly clear, usually via her twitter account.
On Monday morning, we woke up to the gross hashtag #CruzSexScandal trending on Twitter, and on Tuesday, the Divine Miss M made her thoughts on the matter perfectly clear in hilariously appropriate tweet.
The tweet reads: I don t know if Ted Cruz really has 5 mistresses.
If he does, let s hope they have better access to birth control than he would propose.
Here is the tweet:I don t know if Ted Cruz really has 5 mistresses.
If he does, let shope they have better access to birth control than he would propose.

Now, to most of us, the idea that Ted Cruz could find five women who would voluntarily sleep with him is pretty gross, not to mention downright unbelievable.
However, that s not the point here.
Ted Cruz is no friend to women.
He is completely against easy access to birth control, and he is adamantly pro-birth.
We re talking about a guy who would make rape and incest victims give birth, no matter what, if he could.
The idea that a man like that wants to be president of the United States in this day and age is downright scary.
Cruz wants to get inside our bedrooms and uteri, but then again, that s the entire GOP s idea of so-called small government.Hopefully, if this is true, the women Cruz is stepping out on Heidi with think twice before they crawl into bed with him again.Featured image via Twitter
