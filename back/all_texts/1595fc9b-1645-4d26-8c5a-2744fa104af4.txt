Alec Baldwin didn t even wait to taste Trump s salty yet delicious tears after his brilliant Saturday Night Live smackdown of the 2016 nominee.
Baldwin perfectly captured the disaster that was Trump s performance during the second presidential debate, but the true magic happened on Twitter no, we re not talking about the actor nonchalantly retweeting Trump s tantrum.
We re talking about how he perfectly anticipated the meltdown and left a response before the show was even filmed.After the show aired, The Donald had a full-blown meltdown on Twitter (because where else?)
one Baldwin retweeted to make sure the world saw what a mess Trump is.While the world recognized how badass this was Baldwin essentially firing a rocket launcher at Trump s stupid plane and walking away without so much as looking at the explosion what many are missing is that he didn t even need to say a word.
He already did that on Friday in anticipation of the 2016 GOP nominee s oh-so-predictable meltdown.
Before Trump said a word, Baldwin had a response prepared: Fuck your feelings.
He even used a photo of one of The Donald s deplorables to do it.It s disheartening that the GOP can t field someone who won t be baited into a full-blown tantrum by someone making a few jokes about him.
But this is where we re at.
Be sure to vote BLUE on November 8 (not November 28 as Trump told his Deplorables at a rally recently).
This is probably the first time we ve had the literal life or death of our nation riding on an election.Featured image via Getty Images/Paul Hawthorn
