- accelerate the abenomics recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending to realize economic recovery and break away from deflation .

the party previously said it aimed to hit the goal by fiscal 2020 .

- maintain the bank of japan s ultra-easy monetary policy as debate on withdrawing the stimulus is premature .
hope - scrap over-reliance on fiscal spending and monetary easing .
maintain the bank of japan s massive stimulus for the time being , but call on the government and the boj to work together to seek a smooth exit from ultra-loose monetary policy .
- impose tax on companies huge internal reserves and use the proceeds to improve japan s fiscal health and make up for a shortfall of revenues from freezing the sales tax hike .
- seek to adopt a basic income system , in which all citizens receive a set amount of money on a regular basis , to help low-income households .

- use diplomacy to resolve the north korean crisis peacefully .
uphold exclusively defensive security policy .
- utilize nuclear power as an important part of japan s energy mix for now as long as its safety is ensured , but will lower the country s dependence on nuclear energy as more renewable energy sources are introduced .
