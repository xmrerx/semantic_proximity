why should armed civilians have to protect and defend our us military recruitment centers ?
muslim terrorists have made it clear that they intend to target these brave men and women who defend our nation .
is it really too much to ask that we allow them to defend themselves ? civilians , with semi-automatic carbines , eating chick-fil-a , guarding marines .
up yours , @ whitehouse .
