moscow ( reuters ) - the russian defence ministry on monday denied its planes had bombed u.s.-backed militias in syria s deir al-zor province earlier in the day , saying it was always careful to ensure its air strikes were accurate , the ria news agency reported .
ria cited major-general igor konashenkov as issuing the denial which followed allegations from the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias fighting with the u.s.-led coalition , that russia had killed one of its fighters and injured two others in the air strike .
