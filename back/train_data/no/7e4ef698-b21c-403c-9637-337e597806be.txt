vienna ( reuters ) - austria s social democrat chancellor christian kern and conservative foreign minister sebastian kurz on thursday rejected european commission chief jean-claude juncker s vision to expand eastward the euro and a border control free zone .
in his annual state of the european union speech , juncker sketched out a vision of a post-2019 eu where some 30 countries would be using the euro , with an eu finance minister running key budgets to help states in trouble .
french , german and eastern european officials have made positive comments about the speech .
kern , who is running against kurz in parliamentary elections on oct. 15 , told orf radio there was no point in expanding the euro and schengen zone as long as tax fraud , the practice of contracting out work to lower-cost eastern european firms and breaches of limits for government debt had not been vanquished .
it simply makes no sense to enlarge the euro zone before this has not been dealt with , because ( otherwise ) problems would get bigger , kern said , pointing to greece s struggle for years on the verge of bankruptcy as a prime example of such problems .
if you like this is an expansion of the problems at the end of the day and not a plus in european cooperation .
i think this concept is not thought through .
kurz also pointed to greece as a bad example of including countries which do not fulfil the conditions for public finances the eu has set for itself .
the euro and the schengen zone is open for everybody , but only for those that fulfill the criteria ... we must avoid another situation like the one in greece , kurz said .
