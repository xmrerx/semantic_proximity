WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to go to a conference committee to resolve differences between its tax legislation and a rival version passed by the House of Representatives, moving the Republican-led Congress a step closer to a final bill.
Republican leaders are aiming to finalize tax legislation to pass it and send it to President Donald Trump by the end of the year.
