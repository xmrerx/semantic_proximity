During a segment of Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedic host went all out in his defense of Bernie Sanders foreign policy experience.During the segment, the lefties at the table agreed that Sanders is excellent on economic issues.
Though some seemed skeptical that Sanders has the same grasp of foreign policy issues.
Maher was asked by MSNBC s Alex Wagner if he seriously thinks that Sanders is fit to lead the nation as president when it comes to foreign policy matters.
Wagner asks Maher: Do you want Bernie Sanders getting off Air Force One, making a deal on foreign police with ?
Do you think he s at the level that we need?
Maher responds to Wagner s question, saying: Fuck yeah!
The guy who voted right on the Iraq war?
Yea, I do.
Then, Armstrong Williams, an advisor for Ben Carson, decided to chime in.
Williams implies that it doesn t actually matter how well Sanders knows foreign policy.
That s because Sanders would be surrounded by experts.Maher says that might be good enough for Carson, who once repeatedly and publicly referred to Hamas, as Hummus.
Maher recounts the time that Carson said that we need to build a coalition of Arab nations, in order to combat the Islamic State.
When asked what nations he would have been a part of this coalition, Carson couldn t name a single nation.The idea that Sanders wouldn t be strong on foreign policy issues is ridiculous.
Both Hillary Clinton and Sanders, have not been extremely illustrative about their views on foreign policy.
That might have to do with the fact that Democrats are not that passionate about foreign policy issues this election cycle.
There may be a few areas where the two candidates diverge, though, they both seem to mainly differentiate themselves by tone on issues like the Islamic State.You can watch the segment from the show, below.https://youtu.be/62YiMIGmAdc?t=4s Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube.
