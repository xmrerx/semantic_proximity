IS HE FOR REAL?
This is so alarming on so many levels because we lost over 1,000 soldiers in Ramadi and took it back but now we re expected to do it again?
This guy is so out of touch and so aloof.
Ramadi belongs to ISIS and will be VERY difficult to take back.
We re two steps behind in our leading from behind approach to foreign policy and it s NOT working.
