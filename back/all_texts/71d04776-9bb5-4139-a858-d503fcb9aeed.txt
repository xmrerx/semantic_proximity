LIMA (Reuters) - The Peruvian attorney general s office accused former president Alejandro Toledo on Friday of taking bribes from Brazilian construction firm Camargo Correa SA [PMORRC.UL] in exchange for a lucrative highway contract during his 2001-2006 term.
An unnamed state s witness had helped uncover evidence that showed some $3.98 million in payments Camargo made to Toledo through offshore bank accounts controlled by one of Toledo s associates, the attorney general s office said in an emailed statement.
Camargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In Lima, Toledo s attorney, Heriberto Benitez, said Toledo was innocent of the accusations.
I spoke with him yesterday, he said: I didn t take money from anyone, Benitez said to Reuters in a phone interview.
Toledo is already wanted in Peru in connection with allegations that he took $20 million in bribes from Odebrecht[ODBES.UL], another privately owned Brazilian builder, for help winning a contract for building a different section of the same highway.
Peruvian authorities are seeking Toledo s extradition from the United States.
His current whereabouts is unclear, but authorities said in February that he was in California, near his alma mater Stanford University.
Following a judge s order in February that he should be held in pre-trial detention, Toledo said he would not return to Peru.
He has repeatedly described the probe as political persecution .
Last year Odebrecht admitted to paying millions of dollars in bribes in Peru to secure lucrative government contracts over a decade-long period, spurring a far-reaching investigation to determine which officials received them.
Odebrecht and Camargo were at the center of Brazil s biggest-ever graft inquiry, known as Operation Car Wash.
