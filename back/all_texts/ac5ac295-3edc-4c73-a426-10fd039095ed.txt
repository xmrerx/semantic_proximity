With the announcement of her new tour, The Formation World Tour, Beyonc is giving fans the chance to give back to communities in need and through her BeyGood initiative partnering up with the United Way she is making sure the children of Flint, Michigan get the clean water they not only need, but deserve.A statement put out announcing her tour says: True to her life s work of always giving back, fans will be given the opportunity to participate in Beyonc s #BeyGOOD initiative supporting local United Way programs and the continued work surrounding the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.
United Way of Genesee County has been at the forefront of distributing thousands of filtration pitchers, faucet mount filters, replacement cartridges and truckloads of water to underserved populations to address immediate needs in Flint Michigan.
They are also partnering with the Community Foundation of Greater Flint to create a fund that will address long-term developmental, education, nutrition and health needs of the children affected by the Flint Water Crisis.

Beyonc is stepping up big time where government is letting people down.
According to Essence: Funds from the foundation will address the immediate needs of thousands afflicted by the lead-polluted water.
Hopefully, those who are responsible, such as Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder, for this horrific poisoning of an entire community, are held responsible and face the proper repercussions.
In the mean time, Beyonc alongside Cher and several others, have made sure that these kids who have been poisoned by their government get the clean water they need and the services they deserve.Featured image: YouTube
