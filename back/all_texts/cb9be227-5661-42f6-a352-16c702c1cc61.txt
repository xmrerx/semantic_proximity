WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called his counterparts from Mexico and Canada in some of his first exchanges with foreign leaders since taking the helm of the State Department on Thursday, a State Department official said.
The official did not release details of the calls, although they came as U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s pushes to speed up talks to either renegotiate or replace the North American Free Trade Agreement with both countries.
