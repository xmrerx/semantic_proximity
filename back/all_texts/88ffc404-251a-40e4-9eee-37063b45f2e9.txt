WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday criticized Republican Donald Trump’s proposal to dismantle the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, calling the idea “reckless.” “Latest reckless idea from Trump: gut rules on Wall Street, and leave middle-class families out to dry,” Clinton said on Twitter.
Trump, in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, called the 2010 law a “very negative force.”
