Just when you think you re starting to figure out what happened with James Comey getting fired from the FBI, another tidbit of information comes out and turns the whole thing on its head once again.In a new twist, Donald Trump knew that Comey reported directly to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.
So, in an effort to move things along with Comey, he had them come to the White House.According to The Washington Post: The president already had decided to fire Comey, according to this person.
But in the meeting, several White House officials said Trump gave Sessions and Rosenstein a directive: to explain in writing the case against Comey.
And we all know what happened next.
The memos were written by all parties and made public pretty fast.
Faster than Comey could even become aware he was fired.Here s the thing, though.
Deputy AG Rosenstein is pissed he s basically become the fall guy for Trump.WaPo reports: Rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey and that the president acted only on his recommendation, said the person close to the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
You see, the narrative came out that Comey went to the Justice Department only days before he was fired requesting more prosecutors and other personnel to accelerate the bureau s investigation into Russia s interference in the presidential election.
And this request was made to Rosenstein, whose memo was used to justify Mr. Comey s abrupt dismissal on Tuesday.
Now that Rosenstein is pissed, it s looking more and more likely that Trump may have planned it this way and made Rosenstein the fall guy for Comey s removal.The plot in this story of mayhem is definitely getting thicker and it will be interesting to see how things progress in the coming weeks and months.Featured Photo by Getty Images
