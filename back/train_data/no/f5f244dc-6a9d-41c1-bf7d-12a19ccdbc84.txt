copenhagen ( reuters ) - divers searching waters near copenhagen found a second arm on wednesday that police said probably belonged to swedish journalist kim wall , who died in august on board a danish inventor s submarine .
the divers found wall s left arm on nov. 21 in the same area of koge bay near the danish capital .
police said the second arm , like the first one , had been weighed down by pieces of metal to prevent it floating to the surface .
the arm has not been investigated yet but it was found in the same area where we found the first arm and it was weighed down in the same way , police spokesman jens moller jensen said in a statement .
coroners will examine the arm on thursday .
danish inventor peter madsen has admitted to dismembering wall on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea , but he denies murdering her and also denies a charge of sexual assault without intercourse .
wall , a freelance journalist who was researching a story on madsen , went missing after he took her out to sea in his homebuilt 17-metre ( 56-foot ) submarine in august .
wall s cause of death has yet to be determined .
on aug. 23 , police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in copenhagen as wall s. in october , police said they had recovered her head and legs .
