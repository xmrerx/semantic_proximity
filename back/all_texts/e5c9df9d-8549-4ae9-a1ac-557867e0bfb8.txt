Arnold Schwarzenegger, who replaced Donald Trump as host of Celebrity Apprentice, is calling it quits:In remarks Friday, the former California governor cited President Trump, who has repeatedly mocked the ratings of his reality TV replacement, as his reason.
Even if asked [to do it again] I would decline, Schwarzenegger told Empire .
I learned a lot, I had a great time, it was a really great opportunity.
But under the circumstances I don t want to do it again.
With Trump being involved in the show people have a bad taste and don t want to participate as a spectator or sponsor or in any other way support the show.
It s a very divisive period right now and I think the show got caught up in all that division.
NYT s TV reporter John Koblin made the announcement on Twitter:Arnold Schwarzenegger told NBC he's leaving "The Celebrity Apprentice."
