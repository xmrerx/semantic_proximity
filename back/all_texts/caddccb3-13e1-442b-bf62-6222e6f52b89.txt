@realDonaldTrump : - Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses.
This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage.
Merry Christmas!
[0747 EST] - At some point, and for the good of the country, I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion.
Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start.
After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country!
[0805 EST] - “The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.” Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA.
Sadly, the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews.
We are compiling a long & beautiful list.
[0917 EST] - With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman’s Record), Regulation Cutting, Judicial Appointments, Building Military, VA, TAX CUTS & REFORM, Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more, I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
[1004 EST] - Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office.
Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
