washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. navy will likely increase its requirement for a 308-ship fleet given the rapidly changing world security situation , including the u.s. battle against islamic state , chief of naval operations admiral john richardson said on thursday .
richardson said the navy was reviewing an assessment completed in 2012 and updated in 2014 , before russia ’ s reemergence as a “ global power competitor , ” and the start of the u.s.-led campaign to defeat islamic state militants in iraq and syria .
“ i would bet a paycheck that it ’ s going to be a number greater than 308 ships , just by virtue of the additive nature of the complexity and the contestants that are confronting us right now , ” richardson told an event hosted by washington defense consultant jim mcaleese and credit suisse .
the top u.s. naval officer said the navy was already increasing its purchases of virginia-class submarines built by general dynamics corp and huntington ingalls industries inc. , but would also invest in unmanned vessels .
the study is due to be completed this summer in time to inform the navy ’ s fiscal 2018 budget proposal , according to a navy official .
the navy ’ s fleet is currently around 285 ships .
republican lawmakers have repeatedly called for an increase in the size of the navy ’ s fleet , arguing that the sheer number of threats around the world requires more ships to help the united states “ project power. ” others argue that today ’ s ships are more capable and advanced than in years past , increasing the power and capability of each ship and making the larger fleets of the 1980s unnecessary .
