paris ( reuters ) - president emmanuel macron said on friday that france s military would continue its fight against lslamic state in syria , but that the fall of the militant group s bastion in raqqa needed to lead to an inclusive political system to restore stability .
the battle against islamic state did not end with the fall of raqqa and france will maintain its military effort as long as necessary , macron s office said in a statement .
the challenges of stabilization and reconstruction will not be less than those of the military campaign .
in a declaration formally announcing raqqa s liberation from islamic state after four months of battles , the kurdish-dominated syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) said on friday that raqqa would be part of a decentralized federal syria .
france has supplied weapons to the sdf , has special forces operating in the region and has been one of core countries bombing militants as part of the u.s.-led coalition .
the statement also said it was vital that governance in raqqa respected all communities .
this principle should apply first and foremost to the city of raqqa , under conditions that will enable the restoration of normal living conditions , the return of the displaced and refugee populations , and the sustainable return of peace and stability , the statement said .
the fight against islamic state has taken place amid a wider , multi-sided civil war between the government of president bashar al-assad , who is backed by iran and russia , and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers .
syria must finally find a way out of the civil war , which has fueled terrorism since the suppression of the democratic movement by the bashar al-assad regime .
a negotiated political transition is more necessary than ever , the statement said .
