kathmandu ( reuters ) - a bus carrying passengers returning from a hindu festival to the nepali capital of kathmandu skidded off the main highway and plunged into a river on saturday , killing at least 31 people and leaving others trapped , officials said .
the accident occurred around dawn , around 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of the city on the prithvi highway that connects kathmandu with the southern plains .
we have recovered 31 bodies and are looking for more , government official ram mani mishra told reuters from the scene .
it s highly unlikely for anyone to survive for so long under water .
rescuers on rubber boats and police divers managed to spot the bus hours after the crash and were trying to lift it from water with the help of a crane , mishra said .
apart from the deaths , 16 people have been injured , government administrator shyam prasad bhandari said .
two with grave injuries were taken to kathmandu while the rest were treated at a local hospital , he said .
police said survivors were thrown out of the bus windows but another 13 people were still believed to be trapped in the bus .
the bus had left rajbiraj town in the southeastern plains on friday night .
road accidents are common in mostly mountainous nepal , where police say about 1,800 people die in crashes every year .
accidents are also blamed on poorly maintained and crowded vehicles .
