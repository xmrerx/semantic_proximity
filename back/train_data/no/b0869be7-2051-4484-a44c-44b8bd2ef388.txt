kabul ( reuters ) - at least 12 afghan police were killed and four wounded when a humvee packed with explosives drove into their checkpoint in the southern province of kandahar late on wednesday , a government official said .
abdul bari baryalai , a spokesman for the provincial government , said the attack took place in maruf district , bordering pakistan .
the attack , in one of the taliban s heartlands , underlines the threats faced by afghan security forces , notably police units on the front lines of the battle against insurgents who control or contest about 40 percent of afghanistan .
the incident came on the same day that militants attacked kabul airport while u.s. defense secretary jim mattis was visiting the afghan capital .
