The Colorado GOP needs to get their stories straight regarding an outrageously racist anti-Obama Facebook post.
Top Delta County lawmaker Linda Sorenson posted a picture of President Reagan feeding a baby monkey, and the caption read, I ll be damned Reagan used to babysit Obama.
Luckily, even though the photo was removed, a screen capture lives on so everyone can see what a racist POS this woman is:As if that wasn t bad enough, Sorenson originally said that the photo was nothing more than a joke, and went on to say, I really don t care if people are offended by it.
Considering the history of racism in America, and the way black Americans have been compared to animals and treated like animals throughout the history of this country, anyone in such a position of power should definitely know better than post a photo depicting the first black president as any sort of ape.Now, the GOP in Sorenson s county is in full-on damage control mode, and they are insisting that somehow a hacker got ahold of Sorenson s Facebook page and posted the photo to make the lawmaker look like a racist, even going so far as to try to pin the onus for the offensive post on well-known liberal website Media Matters for America.Sue Whittlesey, who is the treasurer for that particular committee, said of Media Matters regarding Linda Sorenson: They ve been harassing her the last few weeks.
Vic Ullrey, who chairs this pathetic outfit, said of the matter: This whole thing is a hoax.
Someone got into the Facebook somehow.
It was hacked and somebody got into it, definitely.
Nothing these people say matters, though.
They are clearly lying to cover this lying, racist lawmaker s ass.
She admitted to not only posting the photo, but to not caring about how offensive it is.
The GOP is full of racists, and the way this president has been treated proves it.Featured image via Mike Theiler-Pool/Getty Images
