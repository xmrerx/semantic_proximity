cairo ( reuters ) - any move by the united states to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital would fuel extremism and violence , arab league secretary-general ahmed aboul gheit said on saturday .
he spoke a day after a senior u.s. administration official said u.s. president donald trump was likely to make the announcement next week .
the palestinians want jerusalem as the capital of their future state , and the international community does not recognize israel s claim on all of the city , home to sites holy to the jewish , muslim and christian religions .
word of trump s planned announcement , which would deviate from previous u.s. presidents who have insisted the jerusalem s status must be decided in negotiations , has already drawn criticism from the palestinian authority .
today we say very clearly that taking such action is not justified ...
it will not serve peace or stability , but will fuel extremism and resort to violence , aboul gheit said in a statement published on the arab league s website .
it only benefits one side ; the israeli government that is hostile to peace , he added .
