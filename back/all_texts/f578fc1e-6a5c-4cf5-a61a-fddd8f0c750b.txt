Donald Trump announced today that his daughter, Ivanka, will be getting the office space in the White House that is traditionally reserved for the first lady.Trump has said that his two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., will run his businesses while he is serving as commander-in-chief.
Although her title has not been officially decided upon as of yet, Ivanka will have the first lady s office.This is unusual, to say the least, but it isn t exactly surprising since the actual first lady, Melania Trump, doesn t even plan to move to the White House.
For now, she plans to stay in New York and continue living in Trump Tower.
Melania said that she doesn t want to uproot their son, Barron, in the middle of the school year.
So they won t be living in Washington until the summer at the earliest.Which leaves Ivanka, the daughter Trump has repeatedly made awkward comments about dating, to fill in for his wife as the first lady in the meantime.Despite the anti-nepotism laws that prohibit the hiring of family members in the executive branch of the government, Trump has been trying relentlessly to find some way Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, can work with him directly in the White House.
After all, laws don t apply to the Trumps, right?You can watch the announcement that Ivanka will have the first lady s office here, via CNN:.
