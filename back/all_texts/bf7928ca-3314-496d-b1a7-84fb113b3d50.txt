Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson tried to use her charms to get past the Secret Service to meet with Vice President Mike Pence.
She wanted to speak with Pence about a pardon for Julian Assange of Wikileaks.
Anderson has been connected to Assange romantically and reportedly visits him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
She s also become more politically active in recent years because of her awareness of Assange s plight.Page Six reports:Spies tell Page Six that Anderson was in Manhattan filming a PSA at the JW Marriott Essex House when she learned that Pence was at the same address.
The blond bombshell has said that she loves WikiLeaks founder Assange and visits him every two weeks in his cramped room at London s Ecuadorian embassy, where he s staying in order to evade extradition.According to onlookers, Anderson marched straight up to the Secret Service and asked to see Pence.
A witness said: The Secret Service agent practically swooned and fainted when she walked up to him and started pressing her finger on his badge.
Pam said, I d like to meet the vice president.
But, the source added, The agent did get it together enough to politely refuse, saying the vice president was busy.
Pamela Anderson s attempt to woo the Secret Service was unsuccessful.When we reached activist Anderson for comment, she confirmed to Page Six: I wanted to thank [Pence] for supporting protection of sources for journalists.
He is heralded for co-sponsoring proposals for a federal shield law, which I deeply admire.
This action would have allowed journalists to keep confidential sources secret even if the government requested them.
She added, I really wanted to mention this it is a topic close to my heart.
Julian Assange deserves a pardon, and I thought I might be able to help.
Julian is a hero to most of the world s youth and free-minded thinking people.
America needs to be on the right side of history.
