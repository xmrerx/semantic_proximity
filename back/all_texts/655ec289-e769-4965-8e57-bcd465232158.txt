You may have seen the latest Republican debates held on Saturday night.
If so, chances are you caught the pre-debate moment of silence held for the belated Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who recently passed away in his hotel room in Texas.
What you may or may not have noticed, depending on how attentive you were, was that Donald Trump stuck out like a sore thumb.
Instead of bowing his head like every other Republican candidate up on the stage, he just stood there and seemed just to stare the entire time.So, this begs the question, does Donald Trump know what to do during a moment of silence?
Or, does he just not care to show respect to dead Supreme Court Justices once they pass away (a right-wing one at that)?
Either way it makes him end up looking like a jackass even more so than the one he already is.Which brings us to another point: remember that time conservatives threw a fit when President Obama was accused of being unpatriotic after a photograph circulated in the right-wing media showing him not placing his hand on his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance?
Well, guess what, that was a total lie.
It was the National Anthem, and the Star-Spangled Banner was playing.Also remember that time, not too long ago, when Republicans also tried to take jabs at the president when he showed up late for a moment of silence held by world leaders in Turkey to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris?
He got an earful in the media for that one.Pic via screen capture.Where is the outrage against Donald Trump?
That s really the question being posed here.
There isn t any.
No, it s okay for President Donald Trump to do that, but not a President Barack Obama.
Trump is going to make America Great Again.
And he s off to a great start at that.Excuse me for one-second while I go throw up now.
