new york ( reuters ) - the use of the # nevertrump hashtag grew on twitter on monday as detractors of republican presidential front-runner donald trump fretted over his momentum on the eve of super tuesday election contests .
on twitter , the top influencer , or person who received the most engagement on their # nevertrump tweets , was trump rival marco rubio , according to online research firm hashtagify.me .
the senator from florida and real estate billionaire trump are engaged in an increasingly personal battle of insults on social media before voters in more than a dozen states select their party ’ s nominee to run for the white house in november .
rubio began using the tag on friday , tweeting : “ donald trump is a con artist - and he can not be our nominee .
# nevertrump. ” the tweet received more than 8,000 “ likes ” and 5,100 retweets .
he repeated the tag in three more tweets over the weekend , with each one getting several thousand likes or retweets .
a spokeswoman for the trump campaign did not immediately return calls for comment .
another major influencer on the tag was conservative commentator glenn beck ( @ glennbeck ) , even though he has used it just once , on sunday .
beck supports u.s .
senator ted cruz of texas in the campaign .
still , beck ’ s post - “ praying for this great country .
praying for a true constitutionalist !
god bless ( an emblem for the american flag ) .
# nevertrump # cruzcrew ” - proved influential , getting retweeted nearly 1,000 times and liked nearly 2,000 times .
traffic on the hashtag was dominated by users who identify as conservative or republican , most expressing vexation with the front-runner .
many tweets focused on trump ’ s cnn interview on sunday , when he declined to repudiate an endorsement from former ku klux klan leader david duke .
trump later said he did not hear the question properly because of a defective ear piece .
whitney westerfield ( @ kywhitney ) , a republican state senator from kentucky , tweeted on monday , “ wow .
trump blaming his failure to repudiate the hatred & extremism of the kkk on a # badearpiece .
# nevertrump. ” “ no , the white supremacist/david duke/kkk question isn ’ t hard .
reject their support & denounce their hate .
again & again & again .
# nevertrump , ” said stephen hayes ( @ stephenhayes ) , a writer for the weekly standard , a weekly conservative magazine .
trump supporters have countered with their own hashtag : # alwaystrump .
“ we must continue to fight on social media , the peoples revolution , the strongest tool right now !
# trump2016 # alwaystrump , ” wrote trump supporter linda alexander ( @ noopdoggy ) .
