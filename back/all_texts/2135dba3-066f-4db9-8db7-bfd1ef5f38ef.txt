What will the world be like post-Donald Trump?
A new hashtag, #AfterTrumpImplodes, is working its way through Twitter, carrying people s predictions about what such a world will be like.
This is especially on target right now because Trump is, in fact, imploding, and he s taking the GOP with him.
That s inevitably good for a strong social media lashing.Of course, there are predictions about what will happen to the GOP:#AfterTrumpImplodes I ll sell the leftover scraps of the GOP on eBay.

AEGreallive (@AEGreallive) August 6, 2016It s pretty clear what people think of a Trump implosion.
There are some Trumpkins trying to fight the onslaught by saying that he won t implode, that it s Hillary who s imploded, and blah blah blabbity blabbity blah the typical delusional ranting from that crowd.
They re mostly being drowned out by people who see Trump for who he really is.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images
