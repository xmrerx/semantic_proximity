CAIRO (Reuters) - A suicide car bomb exploded on Saturday in Syria s eastern city of Deir al-Zor, killing and injuring dozens, the Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
Deir al-Zor, on the west bank of the Euphrates River, is the largest and most important city in eastern Syria, and is the center of the country s oil production.
The Syrian government on Friday declared victory over Islamic State in Deir al-Zor, a big blow to the jihadists as their last stronghold in Syria crumbles.
Earlier on Saturday, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least one Islamic State car bomb killed dozens of people at a refugee gathering on the east side of the Euphrates River.
