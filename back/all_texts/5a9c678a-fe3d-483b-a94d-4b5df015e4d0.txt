Donald Trump recently met with the Republican National Committee as tensions between the Republican Party and the front-runner have been growing increasingly.
Recently, Trump rescinded his initial promise he would back the eventual Republican Presidential nominee, breaking a pledge he signed with the organization in 2015.Trump cited the idea that the Republican Party has treated him unfairly as talks within the establishment of the party have been discussing how they could undermine his path to the party s nomination.
Even for most Republicans, Trump s racism and constant spewing of stupid remarks is too much for them to handle.
He has been the Republican front-runner since the primaries began, and he maintains a comfortable lead in pledged delegates.
At this point, the only thing which could stop Trump from winning the Republican nomination is if the party s leaders step in and break away from who their voters chose.
The implications would be disastrous for Republicans, and would likely inspire him to run independently, effectively killing any chances the GOP has for winning the presidency in 2016, and could potentially tear the party in two.Trump cited on Twitter that the meeting went well, but details as to what was discussed remain undisclosed.The Democratic Party has its own tensions between supporters this election as well.
The issue of campaign finance reform and money in politics has been a divisive issues among Democrats, as even prominent celebrities have openly attacked one another on behalf of each candidate.The contrast between the Republican and Democratic Party has never been greater in recent history.
Both parties have been pulled away from the moderate center.
It will be interesting to see how all of this will unfold in the coming months.Featured image via Flickr
