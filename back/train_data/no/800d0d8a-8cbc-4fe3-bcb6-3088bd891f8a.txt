everyone s been asking where the hillary van is so hillary pulls up in a gas guzzling van with tinted windows-i thought she wanted to mingle with the regular folk ?
this monster gets 16-18 miles per gallon !
ouch ! the van , however , isn t an everyday minivan or even a full-sized van .
it s a luxury vehicle outiftted with top amenities.specifically : it s a limited edition chevrolet express van upfitted with a limited se packed by explorer vans company it s very luxurious , a salesman who helped deliver this vehicle tells me on the phone .
i d rank it up there with the best .
the model being used to chauffeur hillary clinton around has a gray leather interior , heated seat , a 29 inch samsung television , and a blu-ray dvd player.there is no refrigerator in the van .
however , hillary s model does feature an ice chest between the two front seats .
( which might have been used to keep her cottage cheese cold . )
the middle chairs are swivel and quick release .
indirect lighting ( like mood lighting ) throughout the vans.oh , and there s a bed .
the power sofa in the rear of the vehicle converts into a bed .
but given the fact it s only a 6 foot wide vehicle , it might have been a little hard to get a proper night s sleep in it.but it s not exactly great for the environment .
it s a 2014 model all-wheel-drive that gets only 16-18 miles per gallon.read more : weekly standard
