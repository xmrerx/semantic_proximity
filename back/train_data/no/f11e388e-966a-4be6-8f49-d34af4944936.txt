munich ( reuters ) - lawmakers of germany s christian social union ( csu ) , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , have nominated state finance minister markus soeder as candidate for state premier in a regional election .
csu parliamentary group leader thomas kreuzer told reporters in munich that csu lawmakers had unilaterally agreed to nominate soeder , a fierce critic of merkel s refugee policy , as candidate to run for state premier in next year s regional election .
soeder said he welcomed the decision from bavarian state premier horst seehofer to keep the post of csu party leader since this would help to find a way out of the political impasse in berlin .
