moscow ( reuters ) - president vladimir putin said on wednesday that a military strike against north korea designed to destroy its nuclear and missile program might not succeed because pyongyang could have hidden military facilities that nobody knows about .
russia is strongly opposed to the idea of such a strike , an idea u.s. president donald trump has floated , favoring a mixture of diplomacy and economic incentives instead .
but putin , speaking at an energy forum in moscow , mused on the subject on wednesday , making it clear he had serious doubts about the military efficacy of such a move , as well as other political and moral concerns .
can a global strike against north korea be launched to disarm it ?
yes .
will it achieve its aim ?
we don t know .
who knows what they have there and where .
nobody knows with 100 percent certainty as it s a closed country .
putin said russia had more reason than most to be concerned by pyongyang s missile program , saying that north korea s nuclear testing range was located just 200 kilometers ( 124.27 miles ) from the russian border .
the russian leader also reiterated his call for diplomacy to be allowed to run its course and for all sides to dial down the bellicose rhetoric .
he also said he thought trump was listening to russia s views on the crisis .
more sanctions were the road to nowhere , putin told the same forum , saying around 40,000 north korean citizens were currently working in russia .
such workers are known to regularly send back part of their wages to the north korean authorities .
