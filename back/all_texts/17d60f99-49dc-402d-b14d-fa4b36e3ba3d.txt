Legendary actor Richard Dreyfuss has been hitting the interview circuit to promote Madoff, a movie in which he stars as the infamous financial swindler.
In an sit-down with Good Morning America, Dreyfuss took exception to the idea that Bernie Madoff, as bad as he was, should be considered the most despicable man in modern history.
Dreyfuss had another, far more influential, man in mind.GMA host Amy Robach: You ve certainly played a lot of roles in your long career, but what was it like playing arguably the most despicable man in modern history?Dreyfuss: Actually, he s the second most despicable man because I ve already played Dick Cheney.Boom.The host, probably told repeatedly by producers to keep it light and certainly not alienate Republican viewers, can barely contain her laughter despite her efforts.Dreyfuss went on to again clarify that Bernie Madoff is the second worst real-life person he s played, but that he loved playing both the disgraced investor and the disgraced former vice president.By this point, the host is cracking up.
You can actually hear others on the set laughing as well.
Robach tells Dreyfuss, I m recovering from that last response right now.
Dreyfuss isn t exactly overstating things when he points out that Cheney is far worse than Madoff.
Setting aside the level of moral failings that led Cheney to involve America in a disingenuous war in Iraq and his full-throated defense of torture, Cheney also gave rise to people like Madoff by consistently advocating for deregulation of financial institutions.Madoff, to be sure, was reprehensible.
He stole around $20 billion from investors using a complicated Ponzi scheme.
He ultimately cost his victims around $65 billion before going to prison.
On the other hand, Cheney s boss, George W. Bush, oversaw the largest financial collapse since the Great Depression.
All in all, there really is no comparison.Watch Dreyfuss s hilarious interview with GMA s Robach below:Feature image via YouTube
