washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama called on tuesday for america to fix its political system to stop the practice of gerrymandering congressional districts , reduce the influence of money in politics , and make voting easier .
“ democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn ’ t matter , that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest , ” obama said , according to his prepared remarks .
“ too many americans feel that way right now .
it ’ s one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better , ” he said .
