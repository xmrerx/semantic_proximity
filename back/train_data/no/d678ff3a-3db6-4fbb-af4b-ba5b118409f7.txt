washington ( reuters ) - the senate on monday moved closer to confirming dr. robert califf to lead the food and drug administration , overriding opposition from several senators who had sought to block a vote on the issue .
in a procedural move designed to prevent the opponents from blocking the confirmation indefinitely , the senate voted 80 to 6 in favor of limiting further debate on the matter to no more than 30 hours , meaning a confirmation vote could take place as early as tuesday .
democrats edward markey of massachusetts and joe manchin of west virginia among others had sought to block the confirmation vote citing disagreements with the fda ’ s process for approving opioid painkillers .
democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders also placed a hold on the nomination , saying he objected to califf ’ s close ties to the pharmaceutical industry .
under pressure , the fda recently agreed to a number of changes to its opioid approval process , and said it would convene an advisory panel meeting before approving new opioid painkillers that do not include an abuse-deterrent feature .
the opponents said the measures do not go far enough and that advisory panels should be called before any opioid is approved .
“ the fda has to be the cop on the beat , ” markey said .
before the vote opponents , including richard blumenthal of connecticut , took to the floor to berate the fda for approving opioid products such as zohydro over the objections of its advisory committee .
the fda , manchin added , “ must break its cozy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. ” he said more people die of legal prescription drug abuse in west virginia than any other cause .
