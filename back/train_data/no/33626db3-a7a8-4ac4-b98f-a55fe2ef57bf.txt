abuja ( reuters ) - a nigerian minister accused the government s political opponents of sponsoring a campaign for secession in part of southeast nigeria formerly known as biafra , where unrest has been rising .
secessionist sentiment has simmered in the southeast since the biafra separatist rebellion plunged africa s most populous country into a civil war in 1967-70 that killed an estimated one million people .
campaigners from the indigenous people of biafra ( ipob ) have intensified calls for secession since their leader , nnamdi kanu , was released on bail in april .
he was detained nearly two years on charges of criminal conspiracy and belonging to an illegal society .
the military on friday labeled ipob a terrorist organization after a week in which it was accused of surrounding kanu s home in the southeastern abia state , which it denied , and a curfew was imposed in the state .
lai mohammed , the information minister , said late on sunday that ipob was set up as a tool to destabilize the nation sponsored by people he called a coalition of the politically disgruntled and the treasury looters .
they believe that by sponsoring this group to destabilize the country and trigger chaos , they will realize their ambition of escaping justice and then be free to dip their hands into the nation s treasury again , he said .
he did not accuse any people or groups by name .
the minister also said kanu had previously publicly supported nigeria s unity when president muhammadu buhari s predecessor , goodluck jonathan , was in power .
buhari s administration , formed from his all progressives congress ( apc ) party , took office in may 2015 .
the opposition people s democratic party ( pdp ) ruled for 16 years prior to buhari coming to power .
a number of former government officials have faced corruption charges , which they have denied , since buhari took office .
the pdp has accused the president of mounting a witch-hunt against its members .
