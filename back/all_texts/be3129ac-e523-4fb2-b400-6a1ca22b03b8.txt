DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland s second-largest party Fianna Fail, which helps prop up the government, indicated on Friday it would force an election if the country s deputy prime minister does not resign over a policing scandal.
Asked in an interview with national broadcaster RTE whether the only thing that could prevent a snap general election was the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald, senior Fianna Fail member Dara Calleary said: I think so.
