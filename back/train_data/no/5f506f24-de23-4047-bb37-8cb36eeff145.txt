tokyo ( reuters ) - the international community must remain united and enforce sanctions against north korea after its repeated launch of ballistic missiles , japanese prime minister shinzo abe said in an editorial published in the new york times on sunday .
abe s editorial was published before world leaders gather in new york for a united nations general assembly meeting this week , where north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes are expected to loom large over proceedings .
north korea launched a missile over japan on friday , its second in the past three weeks , and conducted its sixth and by far most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3 , in defiance of international pressure .
such tests are in violation of u.n. security council resolutions and show that north korea can now target the united states or europe , abe said .
diplomacy and dialogue will not work with north korea and concerted pressure by the entire international community is essential to tackle the threats posed by north korea , abe wrote .
a week ago , the 15-member u.n. security council unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .
