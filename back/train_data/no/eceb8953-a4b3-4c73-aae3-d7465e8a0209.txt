( reuters ) - a pastor from idaho who was among five american prisoners released by iran over the weekend will return to the united states on thursday from germany , his wife said on wednesday .
“ saeed will be landing on american soil thursday evening , ” naghmeh abedini said in a facebook posting .
saeed abedini , 35 , a naturalized u.s. citizen , was detained in 2012 .
he was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2013 after being accused of harming iran ’ s national security by setting up home-based churches in his native country .
“ he will spend a few days with his parents and then the kids and i will join him on monday , ” his wife said .
the couple have two young children .
the americans ’ release coincided with the implementation of a nuclear deal under which international economic sanctions against iran were lifted in return for curbs on iran ’ s atomic program .
the white house offered clemency to seven iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the united states .
abedini , along with washington post journalist jason rezaian and former marine amir hekmati , arrived at a u.s. military hospital in landstuhl , germany , on sunday .
also released by iran were iranian-american nosratollah khosravi-roodsari , who stayed behind , and american student matthew trevithick .
