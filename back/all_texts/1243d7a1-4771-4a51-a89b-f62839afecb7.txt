Things got really awkward on the set of Fox & Friends on Sunday when host Brian Kilmeade surprised his fellow co-hosts by saying that he liked his meat tight.
Here is the full quote below: I like my meat tight not loose.
Tighten up my meat!
The only response they could muster was: Okay.
Thanks for that information, by the way.Now, it s not like he just started talking about his meat out of nowhere.
The exchange began when co-host Steve Doocy stated to Kilmeade that he s got to try the loose meat sandwich when he goes to Iowa later today.
It s like a sloppy joe with no tomato sauce.
The look on his co-workers faces is priceless because they just weren t expecting him to come back with something like that.
Anything that includes the phrase my meat probably isn t the best way to say it, especially with that kind of enthusiasm.In any case, Kilmeade is never going to live this one down.
He s already becoming an internet sensation for it, and not in a good way.Does anyone else like their meat tight, and not loose?
I mean, there is a difference.
And, no not that kind of meat.
Get your head out of the gutter.
This really is a thing.
And as Steve Doocey was trying to say Iowa s loose meat sandwiches are world famous.
Anytime a sandwich is that good you have to try it no matter how you like your meat.
Kilmeade needs to stop being so uptight and try a good sandwich every once and a while.
