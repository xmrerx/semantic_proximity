WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday there is no “rush” to get a vote on Republican healthcare legislation in the U.S. Congress before he reaches his 100th day in office next weekend.
“We’ll see what happens - no particular rush,” Trump told reporters as he left the U.S. Treasury Department.
“Doesn’t matter if it’s next week, next week does not matter.”
