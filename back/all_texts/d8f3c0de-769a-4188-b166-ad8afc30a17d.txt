John Coleman, Founder, The Weather Channel, appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources with host Brian Stelter, after writing an open letter to UCLA denying the existence of anthropogenic global warming.
This is a great takedown:Coleman told Stelter that CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus.
Well there is no consensus in science.
Science isn t a vote.
Science is about facts, and that he was terribly disappointed by his former network, The Weather Channel, because it has bought into [climate change].
But so has all the media.
That s no big surprise.
Coleman notes that he is not a paid shill (as has been claimed) of the Koch Brothers, concluding his letter with a link to Heartland s Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) website.
Coleman s open letter to UCLA was sent to numerous local television stations in the Los Angeles area, as well as the Los Angeles Times.Coleman produced a special report for KUSI-TV, entitled Global Warming: The Other Side.
The program suggests that Global Warming is a scam and presents what Colemen contends is evidence of a deliberate manipulation of world temperature data by NASA and other groups.
