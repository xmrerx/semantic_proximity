After Donald Trump won the Indiana primary on Tuesday and Ted Cruz dropped out, Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.
This means, that a reality television star and real estate mogul who puts down women and minorities, as well as also being endorsed by the KKK, is going to represent the GOP this November at the ballot box for President of the United States.This is a moment when satire becomes reality, and all you can really do is hold up hope that the Democrats will win.Trump as president is a horrifying prospect.
He has zero public policy experience, no foreign policy experience, and is pretty much hated worldwide.
The world is looking at the United States right now as if we have lost our ever-loving minds.
How could such a vile person be a legitimate choice for leader of the free world?If you don t believe he is hated, because maybe you re a bigot yourself, or maybe you hate yourself enough to like him, or you are absolutely ignorant to reality, take a glimpse at what CNN just accidentally aired.Behind the CNN reporter speaking about Trump supposedly wanting to help the GOP raise money, there is a woman who is speaking for all of us in one united voice as she give Trump Tower the middle finger.
Thus, flipping off Donald Trump.Here s the image that was captured as it happened:via CNNSome may think this is crude, but so is Donald Trump.
If he can dish out insult after insult, and vile comment after vile comment, then he deserves to get a middle finger pointed in his general direction.Donald Trump should not and cannot be our next president.
No matter where you are on the political spectrum, have enough wherewithal to do not only what is best for the nation, but also the world.No matter who VOTE BLUE.Featured image via screenshot of CNN
