While a lot of the nation seems to not give a sh*t that a foreign power just helped decide who became President of the United States, and the mainstream media is sitting on their hands, as well as the fact that Trump has business ties around the world that are a threat to our national interests, the grassroots group Pantsuit Action Network is stepping up and doing the work.The group, also knows as Pantsuit Nation, is a group synonymous with Hillary Clinton s most tried and true supporters, but it is also far more than that.
They are a group dedicated to doing what is best, fair and honest for our nation.In an effort to force our elected officials to investigate Trump s abundance of foreign business conflicts, the Pantsuit Action Network has put together a call to action that with a few key strokes will contact your representatives and ask them to push for an investigation with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Ethics Committee.They write: Mr. Trump s business & financial conflicts of interest are not only unethical, but also illegal & unconstitutional.Urge both the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform and the Senate Ethics Committee to conclude their respective investigations before Trump is inaugurated so that any prohibitive conflicts can be resolved prior to taking office.KEEP FOREIGN INFLUENCE OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE If you wish to contact your local United States Representative and Senators visit their website.You can also urge people to text 528-86 with INVESTIGATE.It is also absolutely critical that we do not allow a foreign power get away with dictating our election.
If this news from the CIA is not looked into further it will set a precedent that the United States is open to outside manipulation and that should send shivers down every spine, whether American or not.Please contact your representatives today!Featured image via Pantsuit Nation
