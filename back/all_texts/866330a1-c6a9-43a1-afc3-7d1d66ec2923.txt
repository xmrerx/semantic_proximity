Team Trump has reportedly been involved in a heated battle with Walt Disney World over the speech given by the president s robotic likeness at Disney s The Hall of Presidents exhibit.A source told Vice that there has been a back-and-forth with Trump s aides and Disney.
Trump s team has insisted that they will write the speech given by the president s robot at the attraction.The source explained to Vice, When Disney tried to get this process started earlier this year, Trump s people said, We ll be writing the speech that the president s audio-animatronic figure will be saying.'
For the last two decades, a robot of the current president gives a speech at the end of the attraction.
In the past, Disney employees have worked together with presidential teams to write appropriate addresses.
The source explained to Vice that: The Imagineers [the researchers and developers behind Disney s theme park attractions] tried to point out that they re typically involved with this process.
That they directly collaborated with Clinton, Bush, and Obama s people when it came to figuring out what the president s audio-animatronic figure would say.
Trump s people said, No.
We re writing this speech.
You guys have no input on this.'
Vice s source says that Disney is afraid of a park boycott of Trump decided to take his disagreement out to Twitter.
They d particularly like to avoid him tweeting about this situation.
It would most likely result in a call for conservatives to boycott Walt Disney World, which is the company s biggest fear.
Disney has denied the report and insists they are working with the White House to schedule a recording session.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
