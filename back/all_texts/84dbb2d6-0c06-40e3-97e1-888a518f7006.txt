NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he thought the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare had a “very good chance” of passing and said the U.S. Senate eventually would be forced to make a deal on the issue.
“I think there’s tremendous support for it.
I think it’s actually much better than the previous shot,” Trump told reporters in New York.
“I thought that when I won (the election) I would go to the Oval Office, sit down at my desk, and there would be a healthcare bill on my desk, to be honest.
And it hasn’t worked out that way.
And I think a lot of Republicans are embarrassed by it.” Trump said he hoped the latest effort would succeed.
“We think this has a very good chance,” he said, describing President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law as dysfunctional.
“At some point the Senate is going to be forced to make a deal.
They’re just about at that point right now.”
