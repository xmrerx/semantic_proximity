For the last ten years, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have been co-hosts on MSNBC s Morning Joe.
They have often seemed a little too chummy, and it has long been speculated that the two were an item.
However, both were also married to other people.
Scarborough got divorced from his wife in 2013, and Brzezinki was officially free in 2016.
To that end, it seems that now that we are in 2017, a respectable enough amount of time has passed to where they can go ahead and confirm the public s belief that they were more than co-hosts.It is now being reported that the two are not only an item, but are actually engaged to be married.
This comes after a bizarre round of congratulations on the Thursday edition of the show.
Of course, the duo s guests said the congratulatory sentiments were about ratings, but now we know that it was about upcoming nuptials.
The news comes courtesy of the New York Post s Emily Smith, who writes: We re told Scarborough, 54, got down on one knee and proposed at the scenic Bar Bellini at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, which has a breathtaking moonlit outdoor terrace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.
Now, think what you want of Mika and Joe I personally have mixed feelings and a bit of a love/hate relationship with Morning Joe but at least they are finally being honest with the public and their fans.
It could be just a bit scandalous, because if they are engaged so soon after Mika s divorce, obviously there was an affair happening while either one or both of them were still married.Of course, these days scandalous affairs are pretty routine for celebrities, though they are supposedly news people or, at the very least, pundits so who knows how the network will handle it.There have been no public statements on the announcement from Joe, Mika, or MSNBC as of this writing.Featured image via Frederick M.
