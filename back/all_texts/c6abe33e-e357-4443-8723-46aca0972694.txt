LONDON (Reuters) - The chances of Northern Ireland s political parties restoring a power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland are not positive and talks in the last few days have stalled, Britain s minister for the region said on Wednesday.
If I had given evidence to this committee last week I might have indicated some momentum, more progress.
That progress stalled at the end of last week, James Brokenshire told a parliamentary committee.
Unless there is a renewed spirit of compromise then the outlook for imminent resolution is not positive.
Time is running out.
