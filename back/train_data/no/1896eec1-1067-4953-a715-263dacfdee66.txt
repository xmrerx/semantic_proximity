nairobi ( reuters ) - kenya s opposition said on sunday it had postponed plans to swear in its leader raila odinga as an alternative president , easing political tensions and opening a window for possible talks with the government of president uhuru kenyatta .
opposition coalition nasa had planned to publicly inaugurate odinga at a rally on tuesday , kenyan independence day , in what the attorney general said this week would be an act of treason .
kenyatta was re-elected as kenya s president with 98 percent of the vote in a repeat election held on oct. 26 which odinga boycotted .
he had beaten odinga in the original poll , held in august , which was nullified by the supreme court on procedural grounds following opposition allegations of vote-rigging and other malpractices .
nasa said in a statement it would postpone the swearing-in after consultations and engagement with a wide range of national and international interlocutors .
it did not specifically name any mediators involved in the talks .
the coalition said it would be announcing a new date for the swearing in ceremony and the launch of its people s assembly as well as a more vigorous and prolonged resistance .
the plan to install odinga as an alternative president had threatened to exacerbate rifts opened by an acrimonious election season that left more than 70 people dead in political violence .
the united states had also urged opposition leaders to work within the law and avoid actions like the proposed inauguration ceremony .
