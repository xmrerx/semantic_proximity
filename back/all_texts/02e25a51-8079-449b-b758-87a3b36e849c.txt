Donald Trump once again attacked our intelligence community for spreading fake news on Sunday, but this time he received a response he probably didn t want.
Outgoing CIA Chief, John Brennan, blasts Pres-Elect Trump on Russia threat.
Does not fully understand, Trump tweeted, once again accusing our intelligence agencies of spreading fake news by presenting him and President Obama with some very real documents detailing the dirt Russia has on him.
Oh really, couldn t do much worse just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes.
Not good!
Was this the leaker of Fake News?

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2017This outburst attracted the attention of Anonymous, the hackers who gained both fame and notoriety (depending on who you ask) after blowing the lid off the Steubenville, Ohio rape case.
YourAnonCentral, an account used by the hacktivist colleective to relay information during the protests in Ferguson and during other times of strife, made sure that Trump knows they are watching him:.
@realDonaldTrump you have financial and personal ties with Russian mobsters, child traffickers, and money launderers.

You are going to regret the next 4 years.
@realDonaldTrump Anonymous (@YourAnonCentral) January 16, 2017We could care less about Democrats attacking you @realDonaldTrump, the fact of the matter is, you are implicated in some really heavy shit.

Anonymous (@YourAnonCentral) January 16, 2017Oh and please tell your interns not to waste money hitting us with your Moldavian bot farm, stay frosty @realDonaldTrump.
Anonymous (@YourAnonCentral) January 16, 2017Anonymous has largely shied away from high-profile hacks involving the government for a number of years, but this exchange indicates interest in perhaps exploring that option among at least some involved with the group: Over the summer, Anonymous leaked Donald Trump s voicemails, which revealed a rather cozy relationship between The Donald and MSNBC s Joe Scarborough.
The recordings were released by Gawker, which was killed off thanks to an aggressive legal attack campaign spearheaded by a guy Trump wants to put on the Supreme Court and carried out by Melania Trump s lawyer.Will Trump s election be enough to rally the Anons to action?
Maybe.
Are they exactly the heroes we need right now?
