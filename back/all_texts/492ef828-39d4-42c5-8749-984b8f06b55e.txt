On Tuesday, Trump announced that he would be skipping Thursday night s GOP debate because Fox News host Megyn Kelly would be moderating it, and Trump is scared sh*tless of her even since she made him look like a complete idiot the first time moderated the GOP debate.Since Trump got his ego handed to him on a silver platter, Trump has kept himself busy with a mostly one-sided feud against Kelly, solidifying the very sexist, misogynistic behavior the Fox host called him out on during the first debate.
It should come as no surprise that Trump s supporters are just like him disrespectful with unhealthy, hateful views toward women.
And it couldn t be any more apparent than their activity on social media.VocativVocativThe tweets from Trump s supporters are hardly surprising these are the same people who routinely attack protesters at Trump s rallies animalistic, violent behavior which Trump sometimes even encourages.Because Trump has refused to participate in the debate, Trump s fans have been demanding that Kelly be removed from her position as moderator after Trump s initial demand for her exclusion was denied.
Trump s followers are all sexist, misogynistic babies and it s easy to see why Trump appeals to these people.Featured image is a screenshot
