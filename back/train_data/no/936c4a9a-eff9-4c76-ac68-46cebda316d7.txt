the antifa supporter who physically assaulted posobiec was immediately arrested .
after reviewing the footage , antifa member , luke kuhn was immediately recognized .
( a face that creepy is impossible to forget ) .video footage of assault where you can see luke kuhn clearly.note the woman who is pretending to be a reporter with a notebook in her hand who tells the police officer , nothing happened when he rushes across the street after clearly seeing what just happened .

lying , violent liberals wearing their little sister s bike helmets and masks .
