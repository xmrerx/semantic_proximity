This weekend, Donald Trump will visit Saudi Arabia and the country is going out of its way to make him comfortable.Everyone knows that Donald Trump basically has the diet of an unhealthy toddler he survives entirely on fast food and junk.
It s previously been reported that Trump prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See s Candies and Diet Coke.
And he shuns tea, coffee, and alcohol.
This was a concern for the POTUS first trip overseas, but Saudi Arabia has come to the rescue.
During Trump s visit, he will be served steak which Trump likes burnt to a crisp with ketchup (his favorite) after all.The Associated Press reported on the preparations that must be made for Trump s visit, stating that there were extra steps that needed to be taken just for Trump: People with knowledge of the planning for Trump s trip say the caterers are planning to offer the president steak and ketchup alongside the lamb and hefty portions of rice on the menu.
All the meat will have been butchered in a Shariah-compliant halal manner as per Islamic custom.
And of course, Trump will probably still find a way to be difficult and ungrateful.
The Associated Press wrote: Trump s hosts on his upcoming trip are well-aware of his aversion to travel and are trying to make accommodations to keep him happy.
Even if things are going perfectly, we re sure Trump will find a way to complain.
He has made outlandish requests before, and just recently canceled a trip to Israel because he wasn t allowed to land his helicopter on top of the mountain fortress of Masada.
This kind of diva behavior is humiliating for the country, and we can bank on Trump have some sort of issue while he s overseas.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images
