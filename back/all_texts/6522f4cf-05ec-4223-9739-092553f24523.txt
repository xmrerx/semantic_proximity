With the sex scandal allegations piling up against Ted Cruz regarding the accusations presented in The National Enquirer, the Republican presidential candidate has been left on the defense, and in the process has been blaming everyone but himself, including fellow Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Well, not to take being blamed for allegations that may or may not be true printed by a tabloid paper, Donald Trump released his own statement surrounding the whole controversy.Here s Trump s statement regarding the allegations against Cruz: I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week s issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it, and have not, as yet, read it.
I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence.
Ted Cruz s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J.
Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin Ted Cruz.
I look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin, winning the Republican nomination and ultimately the Presidency in order to Make America Great Again.
As much as you may hate Trump, you probably also hate Cruz, and this statement is beyond hilarious.
He basically said, yeah, it s probably true, but I had nothing to do with it.
However, he did it in the most hilariously sarcastic way ever by saying The National Enquirer was right about O.J.
Simpson and John Edwards.
Ha!
So much shade.Meanwhile, the adults in the room, otherwise known as the Democratic presidential candidates, are likely sitting back and eating popcorn watching this whole ordeal unfold.
