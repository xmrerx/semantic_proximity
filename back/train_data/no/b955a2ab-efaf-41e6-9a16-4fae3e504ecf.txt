berlin ( reuters ) - half of germans are in favor of calling a new election after chancellor angela merkel failed to reach a deal to form a new coalition with two other parties , while a fifth back forming a minority government , an opinion poll showed on wednesday .
the poll , conducted by insa for the bild daily , showed 49.9 percent favoring another election .
it also showed 48.5 percent think the center-left social democrats ( spd ) are right to rule out joining a new grand coalition with merkel s conservatives , which only 18 percent would favor .
the spd lost ground in the september election after sharing power with merkel for the last four years .
the collapse of talks between merkel s conservative bloc , the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) and environmentalist greens has thrown germany into political uncertainty and raised the prospect of new elections .
the poll showed that 28 percent blame fdp leader christian lindner for the failure of the talks , followed by 27 percent , who blame merkel , while only 13 percent blame greens leader cem ozdemir .
four out of 10 people polled say merkel should run again as chancellor if new elections are called , while 24 percent would prefer another candidate for her christian democrats ( cdu ) , although there is little consensus on who that should be .
the poll showed that most voters would prefer a coalition between the cdu and fdp after new elections , followed by a coalition between spd , greens and the left-wing linke .
however , the poll showed that a new election would bring little change to the results of the september vote , with the cdu down slightly on 30 percent , the spd steady on 21 percent , the greens on 10 percent and the fdp on 11 percent .
that would still mean that the only possible coalitions with a majority would be between the cdu and the spd or between the cdu , fdp and greens .
