WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday repeated his accusation that a Democratic lawmaker had misconstrued private comments from U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.
“His comments were misrepresented,” Trump told reporters, when asked about reports that Gorsuch had criticized Trump’s comments on the judiciary during a meeting with Senator Richard Blumenthal.
