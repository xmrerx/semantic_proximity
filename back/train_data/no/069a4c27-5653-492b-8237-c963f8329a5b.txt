seoul ( reuters ) - south korea s president moon jae-in said on sunday the government will continue to phase out nuclear-generated electricity , following a public opinion survey that dealt a blow to his plans to do so .
we will completely stop all plans for the construction of new nuclear reactors like the government previously stated , moon said in a statement distributed to reporters by his office .
the government will also step up usage of natural gas and renewables in order to maintain its stance of phasing out nuclear-generated power .
moon s statement came after a public opinion survey on friday found a majority of almost 60 percent in favor of resuming the stalled construction of two reactors .
the president asked his supporters on sunday to respect the outcome of the survey , which he called a wise and intelligent response .
completing the two reactors could mean a reversal of a strategy to slowly reduce nuclear energy s share of the power mix , and also significantly eat into the liquefied natural gas ( lng ) demand of the world s second-largest consumer of the fuel .
with the two reactors set to be completed in october 2021 and october 2022 , according to state-run nuclear operator korea hydro & nuclear power , moon said safety standards for nuclear plants would be ramped up .
moon also reiterated his plan to shut down the wolsong no .
1 nuclear reactor , the nation s second-oldest , once the government confirms stability in energy supplies .
the 697-megawatt reactor in southeastern south korea was taken offline in 2012 after reaching its 30-year lifespan , but the regulator approved a restart a few years ago until 2022 .
south korea has 24 nuclear reactors , supplying a third of its electricity .
