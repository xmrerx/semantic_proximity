the boston globe ran a sunday edition with a fake cover slamming donald trump for his desire to secure our border with mexico .
it was kind of a look at how supposedly horrible life would be with a president who actually puts americans first .
fake news is happening everywhere these days but it s a big deal when a major newspaper does it .
this is yet another example of how the media is so desperate to hurt trump.the great thing is that there s the new media that responded almost immediately with a cover of obama .
the different in this cover is that these horrible things are really happening under obama !
way to go !
