DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - A planned meeting of leaders of the eleven countries in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) did not take place on Friday, officials said.
The leaders were set to meet in the afternoon on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam to discuss how to push ahead with TPP, after the United States pulled out this year.
The meeting did not happen, work remains to be done and that s what s happening now, a Canadian official said.
Trade ministers of the TPP countries had met on Thursday but it was not clear if any agreement had been reached.
Japan had said an agreement in principle had been reached, but Canada disputed that.
