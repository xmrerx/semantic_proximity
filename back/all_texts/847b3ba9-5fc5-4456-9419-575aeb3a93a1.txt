An as yet unconfirmed number of white students of a Catholic school in California have been suspended after sending a video to a black student threatening a lynching.The Modesto Bee reports:A racist death threat video posted on social media by a Central Catholic High junior has led to the suspension of students involved and a criminal investigation, but an African American community group is calling for calm while police do their work.
People are asking me, What can I do?, but I want to find out what s been done, first.
Let the natural process take its course, said attorney Jacq Wilson, who is working with the family of the boy targeted in the video.Efforts to dismiss the incident as a high school prank fell on deaf ears in the community.
As Wilson puts it: When has bullying ever been a joke?
When has a death threat ever been a joke?
Right now, with everything going on (nationally), what were they waiting for, for someone to die?
The fact is that people are hurt.
People are scared.
It s a hate crime.
It s possibly even a domestic act of terrorism.
It s a criminal threat, It is also reassuring that Central Catholic High President Jim Pecchenino came out immediately with his own unambiguous statement on the matter.
Students involved in that video have been suspended.
They are not on our campus.
We ll follow our process for discipline, he said.
The whole video is despicable, every part of it.
The noose, the gun going off, it s just unconscionable to view.
It s very unsettling.
The students remain on suspension while the matter is investigated further, with a view to pressing chimerical charges against those responsible.
