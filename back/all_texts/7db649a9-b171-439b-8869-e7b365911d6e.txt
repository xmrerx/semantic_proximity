Nancy Pelosi is obviously geographically challenged She thinks we can dig a hole to China to hear the communist regime laughing at President Trump.
Wrong!
We believe they re laughing at Pelosi for her ridiculous statements During a press conference on Capitol Hill, the House Minority Leader told reporters all we have to do is dig a hole because she thinks China is on the other side of the world from America .It s not.Criticizing the president while he s overseas a taboo practice when President Obama was in office told the media, Candidate Trump said that what s happening in China trade was the greatest theft in the history of the world.
And yesterday, he said our trade deficit with China, which was huge is not China s fault, Pelosi said.Trump blamed Obama s poor negotiating and incompetence for the imbalance, according to a Thursday tweet.
You can almost hear the leadership of the Chinese government laughing from China to America, she continued.
Maybe you can feel it coming through the ground because if you dig a hole here, you will reach China, Pelosi said.What Pelosi did not mention is the president also noted, during his same remarks this week, that while he doesn t fault China for doing what is in its best interest, he does fault previous administrations for entering into bad trade deals.
He said trade between the United States and China is unbalanced and steps must be taken to change that.Trump is right on this but Pelosi continues to pull out all the stops to bash the president Shame on her!
This drama queen needs to go!
