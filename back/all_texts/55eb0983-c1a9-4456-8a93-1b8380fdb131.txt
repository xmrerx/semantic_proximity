Stephen Colbert showed up at the site of the disastrous clusterf*ck that will be the Republican National Convention on Sunday.
The late night host and his crew visited with convention-goers and made preparations for his coverage of the upcoming event.
But the comedian decided to have a little fun with the level of access he was granted when he jumped up on the stage and hijacked the microphone.Dressed as his Hungry For Power Games character, Colbert launched into an assault on Trump and his new sidekick, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.
Colbert declared that Trump has formed an alliance with Indiana Governor Mike Pence just before he pretended to fall asleep.
Sorry, I blacked out there for a moment, Colbert says, before slamming down a gavel and announcing, it is my honor to hereby launch and begin the 2016 Republican National Hungry For Power Games!
As a security guard attempts to remove him, Colbert drops the most memorable line of this stunt:The former Comedy Central host is then escorted off the stage.Stephen Colbert just ran onto the RNC stage.
