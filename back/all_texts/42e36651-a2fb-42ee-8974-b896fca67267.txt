JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will deliver a televised speech on Wednesday in response to U.S. President Donald Trump s anticipated announcement that Washington recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital, a Palestinian official said.
The president (Abbas) will first listen to President Trump s speech, and will then give a response, the official told Reuters, adding that the remarks would be broadcast on Palestine TV.
Trump s announcement on Jerusalem, a city at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was set for 1 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far held off on commenting explicitly about Trump s planned policy shift.
