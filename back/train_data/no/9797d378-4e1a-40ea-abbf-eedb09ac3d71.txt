kinshasa ( reuters ) - at least four civilians and a police officer were killed in eastern democratic republic of congo on monday in clashes between security forces and protesters demanding the departure of president joseph kabila this year , human rights watch said .
the national electoral commission announced this month that an election to replace kabila , whose mandate expired last december , can not take place until april 2019 .
the delay has raised fears of an escalation of violence in congo , which is africa s biggest copper producer .
activist groups in the eastern city of goma had called for a general strike on monday to protest against the election delay .
unrest broke out by 5 a.m. ( 0300 gmt ) between police and protesters , who barricaded roads and burned tires , local residents and the police said .
security forces killed at least four civilians and one police officer also died in the clashes , said ida sawyer , central africa director at new york-based human rights watch .
a spokeswoman for the u.n. mission in congo said it had documented 37 arrests but could not yet confirm a death toll .
provincial police commissioner placide nyembo said that the police officer was beaten to death by protesters and one demonstrator was killed by a stray bullet .
the police also said in a statement that they broke up a planned demonstration in the northern province of tshopo by protesters with jerrycans filled with petrol .
deteriorating security across congo this year , including a spike in militia violence , has prompted fears the country could slip back to the multi-sided civil wars of the turn of the century , when hundreds of thousands were killed in violence and millions are believed to have perished of hunger and disease .
kabila says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters .
his opponents say he plans to change the constitution to remain in power , as other african leaders have done .
