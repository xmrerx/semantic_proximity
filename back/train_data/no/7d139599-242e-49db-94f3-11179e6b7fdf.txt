brussels ( reuters ) - granting catalan leader carles puigdemont political asylum in belgium would be not unrealistic if he asks for it , the belgian migration minister said , underlining his country s position as a contrarian voice in the spanish standoff .
the madrid government sacked the catalan leader and dismissed the region s parliament on friday , hours after it declared itself an independent nation [ nl8n1n280l ] .
spain s constitutional court has also started a review of catalonia s independence vote for prosecutors to decide if it constituted rebellion .
while there was no indication puigdemont was hoping to come to belgium , the country is one of few members of the european union where eu citizens can ask for political asylum .
it is not unrealistic if you look at the situation , belgium s migration minister , theo francken , told belgian broadcaster vtm .
they are already talking about a prison sentence , francken , a member of flemish nationalist party n-va , said .
the question is to what extent he would get a fair trial .
it would be difficult for spain to extradite puigdemont in such a case , he said .
while most european leaders have refrained from commenting on the spanish crisis , saying it was an internal matter and the country s constitution should prevail , belgian prime minister charles michel called for dialogue between madrid and barcelona [ nl8n1md34z ] .
michel , a centrist from french-speaking wallonia , has governed in coalition with the n-va since 2014 , a period during which the party toned down its calls for more independence for belgium s dutch-speaking north .
the relationship between belgium and spain soured over a similar issue in the 1990s and 2000s , when the country refused to extradite a spanish couple wanted over alleged involvement with the basque militant group eta .
