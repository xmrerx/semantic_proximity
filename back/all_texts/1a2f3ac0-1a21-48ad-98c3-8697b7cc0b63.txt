The media is so DONE taking Donald Trump s constant abuse.As he left his Florida resort on Sunday, Trump was greeted by a crowd of protesters who oppose him and his poisonous agenda.The media reported on the protests, and that led to Trump posting yet another temper tantrum accusing the media of being fake news because they accurately reported that the crowd was protesting Trump.Trump apparently is demanding that the media portray protesters as his enthusiastic supporters.
You know, so it looks like everyone loves Trump and he can feel good.Just leaving Florida.
Big crowds of enthusiastic supporters lining the road that the FAKE NEWS media refuses to mention.
Very dishonest!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017Reporters were not amused.George Bennett of the Palm Beach Post wrote that while there were a few Trump supporters in the crowd, they were clearly outnumbered by protesters..@realDonaldTrump motorcade passes hundreds of protesters and a few supporters in West Palm Beach.

@realDonaldTrump while you re still worried about fake news, the people of #Oroville are running for their lives https://t.co/dFl6RE6c0z AJ Joshi (@AJ) February 13, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump Still just a shitty salesman at best.
Look up #OrovilleDam the next time you take to your twitter throne.

Shelley (@itzshelleybell) February 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump we your Floridian neighbors only saw an overwhelming number of protesters.
I understand though, if you couldn t read the signs they held Derek Smart (@dsmart) February 13, 2017If Donald Trump thinks the media is just going to roll over for him because he keeps insulting him, he should think again.
Because the media is getting sick and tired of taking Trump s shit and they are only going to keep calling him out for lying.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images
