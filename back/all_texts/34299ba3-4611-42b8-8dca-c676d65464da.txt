Will this news only increase Obama s desire to work harder to stoke the racial flames in America?
Rasmussen poll released Thursday reveals that two out of three black people prefer the term all lives matter to the protest slogan black lives matter, reports The Hill.Only 31 percent of black people surveyed said that black lives matter most closely comports to their own beliefs, compared to 64 percent who chose all lives matter.
Seventy-eight percent of total respondents also chose all lives matter, including 81 percent of white and 76 percent of minority respondents, according to the poll.Black Lives Matter co-founder Julius Jones told CNN s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday that the notion that all lives matter is a violent statement : And when people say all lives matter, it s actually a violent statement because the only time that people say all lives matter is in opposition to Black Lives Matter and it s the most violent statement of love that you can do, he said incomprehensibly.Apparently the 64 percent of blacks who chose that violent statement didn t get Jones memo.The Rasmussen poll surveyed 1,000 respondents and has a 3-point margin of error.Via: Truth Revolt
