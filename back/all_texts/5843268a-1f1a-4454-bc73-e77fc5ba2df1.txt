If you re a college-age Bernie Sanders supporter, it looks like the Primary schedules were designed to screw with you.
They re going to fall right in Spring Break.
So, if you don t want to be done over by the establishment, it s time to get over this obstacle.The conservative media is already licking it s lips with the prospect that our young Americans are, in their opinion, too stupid and feckless to turn out for Bernie.
As The Daily Caller puts it:Many college students will be too busy drinking and partying on spring break to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders in March, just as his presidential campaign gears up for a series of crucial Democratic primaries in their states.
