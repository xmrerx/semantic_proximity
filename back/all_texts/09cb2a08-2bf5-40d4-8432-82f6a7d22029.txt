If there s one person in this world that clearly gives no f*cks about what people think of them, it s Chelsea Handler.
Her no-nonsense humor is not only hilarious, but often times brutally honest.
She ll say what most people are thinking, but just don t have the courage to say out loud.During this election cycle she s definitely let her voice be heard regarding the candidates running for president, in particular, the Republicans.
Most recently, she s gone after Trump, tweeting:hey @realDonaldTrump.
Do you want to come over and watch #chelseadoesracism with me?
you can even wear a white hat I'll have made for you.
Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 2, 2016Clearly going after the Republican frontrunner s racism and his band of merry racist morons.Now, Handler is going after Trump and his hands, which every one clearly knows is code for dick size.
She goes for the jugular and hilariously tweets out:It stopped raining!
Now what?
@realDonaldTrump, do you want to come over and swing our dicks around my backyard?
Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 6, 2016As recently as last night during a press conference after his Super Saturday victory, Trump was going on and on and on about how big his hands were.
He said: So I just simply held up the hands.
These are very strong hands.
And they re fairly large, actually.
Handler, clearly noticing this coded language and how pathetic it is for someone to try to prove themselves in this manner, called him out perfectly.
Also, just as an FYI to Trump, if you re trying so desperately to prove your hand size and manhood, it likely means you re overcompensating for something.Oh, and guess what?
Dick size has nothing to do with running a country.
In fact, you don t even need one.Featured image: Twitter/flickr
