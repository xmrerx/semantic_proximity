BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Spain s economy is expected to be impacted by the political crisis with Catalonia next year, Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on Monday.
For 2018, we expect growth of 2.3 percent, which would be 2.7 or 2.8 percent without the Catalan issue, he told reporters as he arrived at a meeting with his EU counterparts.
The government had already lowered the 2018 forecast from 2.6 percent to 2.3 percent last month due to Catalonia.
