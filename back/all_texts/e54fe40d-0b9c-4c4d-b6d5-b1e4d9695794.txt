The last thing any politician running for the presidency needs is negative or scandalous hashtags about them trending on Twitter.
However, that is just what America is waking up with regards to GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz.
You see, overnight, rumors began circulating that Ted Cruz has been cheating on his wife with MULTIPLE women.
Of course, those are just rumors at this time, apparently started by The National Enquirer, and there is certainly no proof.
But in the age of the internet, that doesn t matter.Ted Cruz is a creepy guy who nobody likes, so of course people on both the left and right are having a field day over this one.
Here are just a few choice tweets from the #CruzSexScandal hashtag:Hey @tedcruz what were you doing on @ashleymadison?
Is the #CruzSexScandal a reflection of your values?

Obviously some think it s true, while others think it s a bogus smear job.
Either way, the thing about it is this: if the rumors really are true, this isn t about what Cruz or anyone else chooses to do in the bedroom.
It s about the hypocrisy of going all in on the whole family values platform and judging and discriminating against other as a matter of policy and practice.
If these religious bigots weren t so high and mighty and self righteous, nobody would care who they choose to crawl into bed with or anything else in their personal lives.
But, when they politicize sex, they bring this on themselves when these sorts of scandalous rumors start flying.Good luck with this one, Ted.
