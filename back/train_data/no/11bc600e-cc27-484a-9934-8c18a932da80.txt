brasilia ( reuters ) - brazilian highway police on wednesday detained cesare battisti , an italian former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in his country , as he was attempting to cross the border into bolivia in a taxi , federal police said .
battisti was apparently trying to leave brazil after italy reportedly asked brazil s government to revoke his asylum status and extradite him to serve his prison sentence .
he was stopped by highway police as he was about to cross the border in a bolivian taxi and was held for possession of a significant quantity of undeclared foreign currency , the federal police said in a statement .
battisti faced life in prison in italy , where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s , when he belonged to a guerilla group called armed proletarians for communism .
he escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in france before fleeing to brazil to avoid being extradited to italy .
battisti s lawyer , igor sant anna , told reuters that he had sought a habeas corpus injunction last week due to the risk that president michel temer s government could agree to italy s request .
habeas corpus is a legal procedure that keeps a government from holding a person without showing cause .
the police statement said he was being held for breaking currency rules .
o globo newspaper reported last week that italy had asked the temer government to review the status of battisti , who was granted refugee status by former leftist president luis inacio lula da silva on his last day in office in 2010 .
lula had refused an italian extradition request , a decision that upset relations between the two countries .
