On Friday, Donald Trump gave a speech to the NRA after picking up their endorsement ahead of the general election (they don t care if he has a week record on guns, as long as he s a Republican), and in his speech Trump made an insane claim about the country he hopes to lead.
Trump proclaimed, We don t win anymore.
We never win.
This is, of course, absurd.
You can check out the hashtag #WeWinDonald for examples of America winning over the last 240 years (disclosure: I started it).But before the ink on the NRA s endorsement was even dry, along came news of another American victory.
This time against the Taliban, who once harbored Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks (his death, another win for America).The Pentagon says it launched an airstrike in Afghanistan Saturday targeting Mullah Akhtar Mansur, the Taliban s overall leader.
Though the Pentagon is still assessing the results of the airstrike a U.S. official said Mansur was likely killed in the airstrike personally authorized by President Obama.
Today, the Department of Defense conducted an airstrike that targeted Taliban leader Mullah Mansur in a remote area of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, said Peter Cook, the Pentagon s Press Secretary in a statement released Saturday.The Pentagon press secretary also explained that Mansur has been actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners.
President Obama authorized the drone strike that appears to have killed the Taliban leader while en route to Vietnam on Air Force One.You may remember that President Obama s epic correspondent s dinner roast of Donald Trump came at the same time the Bin Laden raid was about to be executed.
Perhaps it s time to start panicking if you re in Al Qaeda or the Taliban or ISIS when Trump s buffoonery is in the news.Featured image via Flickr
