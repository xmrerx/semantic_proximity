Two days ago, the former MSNBC host Joy Reid suggested that reporters should humiliate President Trump and ask him if he knows the names of the 4 U.S. soldiers who were killed by Islamic extremists in Niger?The next time Donald Trump holds a press briefing, I hope a reporter will ask him to simply name the four soldiers killed in Niger.
Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) October 18, 2017Reid was quickly slammed by Benghazi survivor Kris Paronto who asked Joy if she knew his name, or any of his teammates that were left to die along with my by your messiahs @BarackObama and @Hillary Clinton?
Do you know my name Joy?
how about my teammates that were left to die along with me by your messiahs @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton https://t.co/FQpu6yp1Vu Kris Paronto (@KrisParonto) October 18, 2017The very next day, Reid again stuck her foot in her mouth regarding the Niger attack on our U.S. troops.
With no knowledge or understanding of the reason our troops were stationed in Niger, the former MSNBC host tried to attack President Trump, as she suggested that it was Trump s fault that 4 of our brave US troops were killed there by Islamic extremists.Again: why are US troops in Niger?
And why haven t the relevant Republican committee chairs scheduled hearings?

Miller s response to Reid was hilarious and humiliating all at once Hi Joy.
Troops were sent to Niger by Barack Obama.
Hope this helpshttps://t.co/QDfYg8gtQu https://t.co/9wMOqaWp6Z Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 19, 2017That wasn t the end of the criticisms for the uninformed former host of the propaganda network MSNBC.
Joy s tweet continued to take more hits from people who are sick and tired of watching the media (or former media in Reid s case) make up lies about our President without being challenged.Via CBS NEWS.
Which is obviously an alt right news outlet now.
Braindead liberals.
