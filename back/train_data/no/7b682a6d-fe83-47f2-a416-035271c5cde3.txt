paris ( reuters ) - french government spokesman christophe castaner said on wednesday that emmanuel macron was backing him to lead the year-old republic on the move ( lrem ) party that brought the president to victory earlier this year .
if castaner wins a nov. 18 election for the party s leadership , it could trigger a minor government reshuffle as he is a cabinet member in charge of relations with parliament .
lrem won a large majority in parliamentary elections in june , consolidating macron s presidential win in may .
like macron , most lrem lawmakers had never previously held elected office .
if he chose me and supported my candidacy in the collective talks we re having , it s because i ve got the support of the party s rank and file , castaner said on rtl radio .
previously a socialist lawmaker from southwestern france , castaner joined macron s campaign early as his spokesman .
since macron s victory , castaner has become a familiar face on national television defending the president s reform agenda .
thanks to castaner s socialist roots , macron s backing for him could help counter recent criticism of macron as a president of the rich for partially scrapping the wealth tax , a symbol of france s income redistribution system cherished on the left .
castaner said that for the moment no one else had put forward their candidacy to lead the party .
