frankfurt ( reuters ) - the german army contemplated fissures in the european union and a rise in global conflicts as one of six scenarios that might play out by 2040 , german magazine der spiegel wrote in this week s edition .
the eu experienced a damaging debt crisis in 2010-12 and is now navigating britain s departure from 28-country club , the first country to choose to lose the bloc .
in their scenarios , the german army s strategists envisaged a situation where more countries follow britain s footsteps and the world becomes increasingly disorderly .
the eu enlargement has been largely abandoned , more states have left the bloc , they wrote in the study cited by der spiegel .
the increasingly disorderly , sometimes chaotic and conflictual world has dramatically changed the security policy environment for germany and europe .
the magazine said the study would be followed by concrete armaments plans to be developed in the coming years .
a defence ministry spokesman said on sunday the study , labeled strategic perspective 2040 , made robust predictions but did not attach probabilities to them or trigger decisions .
he declined to comment about the content of the report , which is confidential .
the five other scenarios cited by der spiegel include one where some eastern european states halt progress in eu integration and others enter the eastern bloc , a likely reference to russia and its allies .
german chancellor angela merkel has said the eu risked running into trouble unless it allowed members to participate at varying levels of intensity , with those using the euro currency pulling closer together .
two scenarios in the army s study saw a comeback of russian-style state capitalism in some eu countries and a halt in globalisation .
a further two envisaged a more peaceful world .
