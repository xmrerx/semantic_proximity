HARARE (Reuters) - Following are key figures in Zimbabwe First Lady Grace Mugabe s G40 political faction, the target of an overnight coup by the military.
The whereabouts of all of them are unknown, although sources in Harare have said some are in detention.

JONATHAN MOYO - A slick propagandist and former information minister, Moyo was G40 s brains and mouthpiece who never shied away from an acerbic comment or Tweet about his rivals.
His Twitter feed has been uncharacteristically silent since the coup.
SAVIOR KASUKUWERE - A bruising former ZANU-PF Youth minister nicknamed Tyson , Kasukuwere ran Mugabe s attempts to indigenise the economy, essentially forcing foreign investors to surrender large stakes in their businesses to locals.
IGNATIUS CHOMBO - A former University lecturer and Mugabe s homeboy, Chombo was promoted in an October cabinet reshuffle from the interior ministry to the finance portfolio, just as a severe domestic currency shortage tipped over into full-blown financial collapse.
AUGUSTINE CHIHURI - As Commissioner General of the police, Chihuri was accused by rights groups of presiding over vicious crackdowns on dissent and popular protest in the last 18 months.
KUDZAI CHIPANGA - The 35-year-old youth leader ingratiated himself to Mugabe and Grace and organized nationwide youth rallies that Grace Mugabe used to attack Mnangagwa and his allies.
