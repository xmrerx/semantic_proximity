every nameless , beaten down , forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what we called the middle class , loves trump .
the human hand grenade they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them .
and on november 8th , election day , although they ve lost their jobs , although they ve been foreclosed on by the bank , next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone , the cars been re-po d , they haven t had a vacation in years and they re stuck with the shitty obamacare bronze plan where they can t even get a f * cking percocet .
they ve essentially lost all that they ve had except one thing .
the one thing that doesn t cost them a cent , and it s guaranteed to them by the american constitution the right to vote ! they might be penniless they might be homeless it doesn t matter because it s equalized on that day .
the millionaire has the same number of votes as the person who doesnt have a job .one !
so on november 8th , the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth , be handed a ballot , close the curtain and take that lever , or felt pen or touch screen and put a big f * cking x next to the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives donald j. trump .
watch :
