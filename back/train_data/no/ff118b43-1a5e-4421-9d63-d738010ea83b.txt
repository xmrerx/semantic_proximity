no matter which candidate you are supporting , this is awesome !
cnn tried to get a gotcha moment with an interview between carol costello and donald trump s former butler : he s an incredibly generous person .
he s been generous to his employees .
he s generous to strangers .
he s an entirely a nice guy .
he s not the gruff person that people make him out to be .
sure , you attack him , he s going to fight back .
but most of the time he s just a nice man .
i lasted with him for 20 years , he had to be pretty good .
