( reuters ) - hurricane irma is likely to be downgraded to a category 4 storm by the time it makes landfall in florida , the u.s. national hurricane center said on thursday .
irma , at present a category 5 storm packing maximum sustained winds of 180 miles ( 285 km ) per hour , is moving off the northern coast of the dominican republic , the nhc said .
it has become a little less organized over the past few hours but the threat of direct hurricane impacts in florida over the weekend and early next week continues to increase , it said .
hurricane watches were in effect for the northwestern bahamas and much of cuba .
irma , one of the most powerful atlantic storms in a century , killed eight people on the caribbean island of saint martin and left barbuda devastated on thursday .
meanwhile , a hurricane swirling in the gulf of mexico , katia , which is about 195 miles ( 310 km ) northeast of veracruz with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour ( 130 km per hour ) , is likely to gain near major hurricane strength by landfall , the nhc said .
a third hurricane in the atlantic , jose , has strengthened slightly and is expected to intensify further over the next 48 hours , it added .
hurricane jose is about 815 miles ( 1,310 km ) east of the lesser antilles with maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour ( 150 km per hour ) , the miami-based weather forecaster said .
