united nations ( reuters ) - about 66 million people are forcibly displaced worldwide and weak international cooperation and solidarity are behind the rising numbers , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees , filippo grandi , said on thursday .
grandi , speaking to the united nations security council , said the number of displaced is up from 42 million in 2009 , the last time one of his predecessors addressed the 15-member group .
the sharp rise in forced displacement reflects weaknesses in international cooperation and declining capacity to prevent , contain and resolve conflicts , grandi said .
the ongoing conflict in syria and violence in iraq account for about a fourth of those currently displaced , grandi said , adding that a combination of poverty , lack of development , environmental degradation , inequality and persecution combine in poorly governed parts of the world to trigger more crises .
he highlighted the importance of the u.n. s peace-keeping missions , whose role he called critical .
grandi criticized countries with closed borders and hurdles to asylum access and said some are often those least impacted by refugee flows , and often wealthy .
last month , grandi singled out europe , the united states , and australia for increasingly unwelcoming policies .
[ nl8n1md24c ] many refugee-hosting states , particularly those neighboring conflict zones , keep their borders open and generously host thousands sometimes millions of refugees , he said .
grandi asked the security council to find political solutions that could prevent even more people from being displaced .
they , the uprooted people , grandi said , are counting on your leadership to help deliver those solutions .
