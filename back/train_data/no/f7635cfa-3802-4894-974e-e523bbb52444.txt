phnom penh ( reuters ) - cambodia s main opposition party on monday put up banners around the country calling for the release of its detained leader kem sokha in a challenge to the government of prime minister hun sen , which has accused him of treason .
kem sokha , the leader of the cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) , was arrested on september 3 and charged with plotting against the state .
western countries and human rights groups have condemned the arrest and said it raises severe doubt over whether next year s general election can be fair .
in the ballot , hun sen could face his greatest electoral test of more than three decades in power .
the party s banners , which have a picture of kem sokha waving from a vehicle during the last election campaign in 2013 , called for the leader s immediate and unconditional release .
hun sen has said the opposition must drop kem sokha and choose a new leader or face a total ban .
we will put up the banners , not just here , but we will put up banners at our branches in provinces , said pol ham , a deputy leader of the party .
son chhay , another senior member of the party , said the crisis was worsening and talks were needed to resolve it .
the evidence presented against kem sokha so far is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of u.s. experts .
hun sen says his rival was getting help from the united states .
the u.s. embassy has rejected any suggestion of interference in politics .
government spokesman phay siphan said the opposition party s banners amounted to pressure on the court and an attempt to interfere with its work .
this is unacceptable , he said .
a court is scheduled to hold a hearing to determine the legality of kem sokha s detention on tuesday .
