berlin ( reuters ) - germany hopes to resume its mission training kurdish peshmerga fighters in northern iraq on sunday , provided the conflict between the kurds and the iraqi government does not worsen , a german defense ministry spokesman said on friday .
germany suspended its training assistance last week citing the increased tensions between baghdad and the kurds after the semi-autonomous kurdistan region in northern iraq voted in a non-binding referendum for independence .
germany , along with other western nations , joined baghdad and iraq s neighbors in opposing the referendum , partly due to concerns that it would distract from the fight against islamic state militants , in which the kurds have played a key role .
if there is no serious changes on the ground , it s highly probable that the training will resume on sunday , the german defense ministry spokesman said .
the spokesman said germany took the decision to resume the training after consultations with the kurdish and iraqi parties and with the united states .
he was speaking on the day when iraqi forces completed their push to take back control of the contested province of kirkuk from the kurds , who had moved into the area in 2014 to prevent islamic state seizing the oilfields .
germany has provided 32,000 assault rifle and machine guns , as well as other weapons valued at around 90 million euros since 2014 .
about 150 german soldiers are providing training to the kurdish peshmerga fighters for their combat against islamic state militants in syria and iraq .
