Not too many people had heard of Bernie Sanders until recently.
Although a senator, Sanders doesn t come from a famous political family, nor is he a party favorite.
However, Sanders has taken the country by storm and ignited an energy and excitement for the political process not seen in decades.
That s because Sanders ideas have hit home for many people.
His new campaign ad for the presidency sums up his policies in such an impassioned way that it will leave you in tears.
The ad begins with the statement: What does it mean to lead a moral life?
When we talk about morality, and when we talk about hope, we have to understand that there is no justice when so few have so much and so many have so little.
There is no justice when the top 1/10th% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%.
Sanders also touches on the fact that millions of people are working long hours but unable to feed their children, and the fact that the United States today has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any country in the developed world.
Instead, Sanders says we use our money for the wrong reasons: How can we talk about morality and justice when we turn our backs on the children of our country?
We have in this country sufficient amounts of money to put more people in jail than any other country on earth but apparently we do not have enough money to provide jobs and education to our young people.
The touching four minute ad continues to hit on topics vital to the interests of millions of Americans including healthcare to all people as a right.
All of the people, the poor and the wretched have a right to go to the doctor when they are sick.
Bernie Sanders ideas resonate with many Americans because he s been able to eloquently bring to light issues that the majority of politicians lack the courage in tackling.
He s the most genuine presidential candidate in generations.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSRUmRYrRLY]Featured image via video screenshot.
