HELSINKI (Reuters) - If the United States withdraws from the Paris climate deal, it would be a big setback, Finland’s Prime Minister Juha Sipila told parliament on Wednesday.
“If this is true, it is a big setback.
Then, we must find partners to continue, because this work must not stop,” Sipila said.
Climate change was a priority for Finland in the Arctic Council as well as the European Union, he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make an announcement on whether he will stay in the agreement this week, with media reports on Wednesday suggesting he had made up his mind to withdraw.
