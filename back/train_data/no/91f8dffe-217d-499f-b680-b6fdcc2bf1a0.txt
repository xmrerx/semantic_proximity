moscow ( reuters ) - russia respects the desire of iraqi kurdistan to assert its identity but this must be done in dialogue with the iraqi government , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on monday at talks with his iraqi government counterpart .
relations between iraqi kurdistan and the central government in baghdad have been in crisis since the region held an independence referendum last month .
the iraqi military took back the oil-rich kirkuk area from kurdish forces last week .
we understand the hopes of the kurdish people as it concerns their striving to strengthen their identity , their self-awareness , lavrov said at a news conference with iraqi foreign minister ibrahim al-jaafari .
however , we believe it is correct to realize those desires , those hopes exclusively via the iraqi government and taking fully into account the significance the kurdish question has on a regional scale , and taking into account the need to avoid additional sources of instability in the region .
lavrov was meeting jaafari days after russian state oil major rosneft agreed to take control of iraqi kurdistan s main oil pipeline .
iraqi oil minister jabar al-luaibi said on saturday he had sought clarification from rosneft .
lavrov said russia would continue its economic ties with iraqi kurdistan , as it does with other constituent parts of iraq .
he said russia was not closing its consulate in erbil , the main city in iraqi kurdistan , but said the mission was subordinate to the russian embassy in baghdad .
