Conservative columnist Ann Coulter took her vomit-inducing support of Donald Trump onto MSNBC yesterday to argue that the presumptive Republican nominee shouldn t even bother trying to convince prominent GOPers like House Speaker Paul Ryan to support him.
She said it was a complete waste of the business mogul s time because he pretty much owns the GOP and represents the heart and soul of the Republican party now.As the discussion about Trump s Thursday meeting with Ryan was being discussed, host Chris Matthews wondered what might actually convince Ryan to support a presidential candidate that he was clearly having reservations about and who could blame him?!
Coulter shrugged this off and laughed, asserting her opinion that Trump was only having this meeting with Ryan out of the goodness of his heart.
Coulter told Matthews: It shows that Trump is being unbelievably gracious.
He doesn t need to have this meeting [with Paul Ryan].
He is the party.
He is the heart and soul of the party.
Pointing out just how incredibly gracious this stunt by Trump is, she told Matthews that he could have just said, hope he comes aboard, we re gonna have a lot of fun, but if he doesn t, oh well after Ryan withheld his endorsement.To make Coulter s appearance on the show even more outrageous, she made sure to promote her new book, In Trump We Trust.
She said that in the future, she hoped that Trump wouldn t waste any more of his precious time convincing the GOP to back him.
The people are with him, and there s no point in meeting with all these generals without armies.
According to Ryan, his meeting with Trump will be centered around how to unify the Republican Party.
Ryan said: It s been a bitter and divisive primary.
It s going to take more than one week just to repair and unify this party.
Apparently, Trump thinks he s got this one in the bag.TwitterFeatured image is a screenshot
