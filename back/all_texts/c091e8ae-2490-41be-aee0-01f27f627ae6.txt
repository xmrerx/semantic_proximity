WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A budget proposal to be released by President Donald Trump on Thursday will call for spending cuts of up to 31 percent for the U.S. State Department and 28 percent for foreign aid, congressional aides said on Wednesday.
The reduction in the State Department budget, while steep, is below the 37 percent cut some officials in recent weeks had said was possible.
