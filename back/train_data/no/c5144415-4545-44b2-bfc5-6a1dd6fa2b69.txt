sydney ( reuters ) - australia s second-largest state on wednesday took another step towards adopting a law allowing voluntary assisted dying for terminally ill patients .
any resident of victoria state over 18 , with a terminal illness and with less than six months to live can request a lethal dose of medication under the new legislation .
assisted dying will remain illegal in australia s other five states .
in a vote in victoria s upper house , 22 of 40 senators supported the legislation .
the legislation required amendments to pass the upper house , including halving the time frame for eligible patients to access the scheme , reduced from 12 months to live to six months to live .
the amendments must be approved by the lower house before becoming law .
the legislation is not expected to be opposed .
there will be exemptions for sufferers of conditions such as motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis , who can request a lethal dose of medication even if they have been given up to a year to live .
many countries have legalized euthanasia , including canada , the netherlands , switzerland , and some states in the united states .
but australia s federal government has opposed legalizing euthanasia even though the remote northern territory , which does not hold australian statehood , became the first jurisdiction in the world to do so in 1995 .
the federal government enacted its own legislation to override the northern territory law in 1997 under rules allowed by the constitution .
state law , however , can not be overridden .
