Tell us Susan what s worse, Iran with a nuclear weapon and billions of dollars to help fund muslim terrorists or Iran with a nuclear weapon and frozen assets?
President Obama s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, told CNN s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that we should expect Iran to use the money it gets under sanctions relief for military and even terrorist operations.As part of Obama s nuclear agreement with Iran, tens of billions of dollars frozen as part of the sanctions on Iran will be released over time provided Iran complies with a list of deadlines outlined in the agreement.
What do we think they ll spend that money on?
We think, for the most part, they re going to need to spend it on the Iranian people and their economy which has tanked, she told Blitzer.Of course, murderous regimes like Iran don t generally limit themselves to domestic infrastructure projects and welfare schemes, which Rice quickly acknowledged.
But yes, it is real, it is possible, and, in fact, we should expect that some portion of that money would go to the Iranian military and could potentially be used for the kinds of bad behavior that we have seen in the region up until now, she said.By bad behavior Rice is presumably referring to Iran s funding of terrorist organizations, and its expanding military operations throughout areas such as Yemen.Despite the fact that the Obama administration fully expects Iran to use its newly released billions to fund terrorism, Rice told Blitzer those concerns didn t play an important role in negotiations.
The goal here, Wolf, was never, and was not designed to prevent them from engaging in bad behavior in the region.
They re doing that today, she said.
The goal is to ensure that they don t have a nuclear weapon, and therefore, when they are engaging in that bad behavior, are that much more dangerous.
Rice s acknowledgement of Iran s bad faith might not bother the administration, but it is likely to cause a little concern in congress.After all, Iran s bad behavior is a pretty good indication that the murderous regime in Tehran has no intention of cleaning up its act which makes it somewhat hard to trust they will abide by an Obama sponsored agreement.Via: BizPacReview
