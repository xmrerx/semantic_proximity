donald trump s fans are idiots and this time it could have gotten people killed .
since before the election , an incredibly stupid story has been circulating in right-wing circles regarding hillary clinton , john podesta , and the two of them running a child sex ring out of a pizza joint in washington , d.c .
ever since this story began circulating , the owners of comet ping pong say they have received numerous death threats and a wealth of harassment.ever since this story began circulating , the owners of comet ping pong say they have received numerous death threats and a wealth of harassment .
though they have done all they can including contacting the fbi and other law enforcement agencies and even facebook in an attempt to get the wildly untrue and horrible pizzagate story taken down .
on sunday , restaurant employees worst fear came true when one of trump s rabid , violent , and dangerously stupid fans showed up with a gun.police received a call about a man carrying a weapon just before 3 p.m. and chaos erupted .
police sealed off the surrounding block with tape suspect was fortunately arrested without incident .
naturally , trump supporters see this as a validation of their whacked-out beliefs on the matter : it is very clear that law enforcement is not going to act on # pizzagate unless we all make a huge public stink they can not ignore .
paul revere ( @ prponline ) december 4 , 2016the # pizzagate deniers are really coming out of the woodwork .
who knew that pedophiles had such strong support with america 's left ?
paul revere ( @ prponline ) december 4 , 2016of course the lefties do n't want an investigation of # pizzagate .
they 've been trying to normalize pedophilia for years now .
wife with a purpose ( @ apurposefulwife ) december 4 , 2016the entire reason for dnc and msm creation of a # fakenews narrative is to discredit the future scandal known as # pizzagate comet ping pong trumptrain ( @ trumptrain09 ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules most likely an attempt to discredit # pizzagate .
no different from the hate crime hoaxes .
nikolajs ? ?
( @ greatnikolajs ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules maybe pysop .
to prove how `` fake news '' hurts innocent small businesses # pizzagate # pedofiles goldensack ( @ goldensack ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules likely a false flag that will be blamed on the right .
nothing ( @ ixyfang ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules @ zeduslepedus what i dont understand is this .. any accusations of pedophilia , harm to child or related matters must be .. rakka ( @ ericbarton_okc ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules @ zeduslepedus investigated has anyone .. called tipline or any authorities for investigation ? ?
yall research for proof make rakka ( @ ericbarton_okc ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules @ zeduslepedus a few phone calls that will have to be looked at .
rakka ( @ ericbarton_okc ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules @ zeduslepedus take your hest evidence and report to multible agencies , from multible people reporting .. see what happens rakka ( @ ericbarton_okc ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules @ zeduslepedus future kid rapes fall on those who know and do nothing .
like @ corey_feldman he eithet full of crap or has rakka ( @ ericbarton_okc ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules @ zeduslepedus blood on his hands rakka ( @ ericbarton_okc ) december 4 , 2016 @ cassandrarules its amazing how no one is investigating this bryce pity ( @ heeldowlin__ ) december 4 , 2016fortunately , no one was hurt this time but conservatives have a bad habit of getting worked up over fake stories .
last month , a macedonian teen who has been duping the right with fake stories for quite some time explained that liberals tend to catch on to non-legit stories quickly , but conservatives just run with it .
we ve tried to do similar things to liberals .
it just has never worked , it never takes off , he said .
you ll get debunked within the first two comments and then the whole thing just kind of fizzles out .
the teen makes between $ 10,000 and $ 30,000 monthly from right-wing stupidity .
while some may blame those who act as purveyors of fake stories , the blame truly lies with people who are too stupid to exist in a functioning society.watch a report on the gunman below : featured image via washington post/getty images ( john w. adkisson )
