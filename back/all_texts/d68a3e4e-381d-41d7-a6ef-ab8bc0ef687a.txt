AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A preliminary autopsy indicates that Bosnian Croat war crimes convict Slobodan Praljak died of cyanide poisoning, Dutch prosecutors said on Friday.
Praljak said he had taken poison in the courtroom immediately after his conviction and 20-year sentence were upheld on Wednesday, and died shortly afterward.
In a statement, prosecutors said a toxicological test found Praljak had a concentration of potassium cyanide in his blood.
This has resulted in a failure of the heart, which is indicated as the suspected cause of death .
