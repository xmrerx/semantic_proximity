baghdad ( reuters ) - elections for iraq s kurdistan region s presidency and parliament set for nov. 1 will be delayed because political parties failed to present candidates , the head of the electoral commission hendrean mohammed told reuters on monday .
parties have been unable to focus on the elections because of turmoil that followed a referendum on sept. 25 on kurdish independence , a kurdish mp said on condition of anonymity .
authorities in baghdad as well as neighbors iran and turkey opposed the referendum that saw a clear independence majority .
last week , iraqi forces captured the oil city of kirkuk and other territory claimed by the kurds in retaliation for the referendum , dealing a severe blow to kurdistan regional government ( krg ) president masoud barzani .
the kurdish electoral commission s mohammed , speaking by phone from the krg capital erbil , in northern iraq , said it is up to the kurdistan region s parliament to fix a new date for the elections .
the deadline to present candidates expired last week and was extended until monday .
the current krg presidency , held by barzani since 2005 , and parliament , elected in 2013 , are expected to continue until new votes are held , he said .
the loss of kirkuk prompted calls from gorran , the main opposition party to barzani , for his resignation .
gorran , or the change movement , supports the right of iraq s kurds for self-determination but it opposed holding the referendum on sept. 25 , saying the timing was ill-chosen .
