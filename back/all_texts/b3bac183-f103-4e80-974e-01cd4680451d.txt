During a segment of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the issue of voter disenfranchisement.
Republicans have everything to gain by making it harder to vote.One of the hot button issues of the day is Republicans creation of laws that force people to have valid identification when they vote.
The genius behind the plan is that it seems so innocent to require people to show identification in order to vote.
However, it has been shown that it can be far harder to have all the valid identification that some states are now requiring than one might think.
Oliver notes how hard it can be just to get an ID due to the times that ID-issuing offices are closed: And in some parts of the country, the offices that issue IDs are hardly ever open.
In 2012, a study found that in Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi, fewer than half of all ID-issuing offices in the state are open five days a week.
And in Sauk City, Wisconsin the ID office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month and only four months in 2016 even have five Wednesdays, Oliver says.Those Republicans wish to see vote the least are minority voters, who traditionally back Democratic candidates.
That s why during the segment, John Oliver points out how much these anti-democratic schemes disproportionately hurt Black and Latino voters.
Studies have shown these restrictions tend to disproportionately impact African-American and Latino voters.
In Texas, for instance, experts found that African-American voters were nearly twice as likely to lack voter ID, and Latinos were nearly two and a half times as likely.
It s just one of those things that white people seem to be more likely to have, like a sunburn or an Oscar nomination, says Oliver.The Republican Party is dying due to demographic and ideological changes.
Instead of changing their Party s platform, they would rather sink to these pathetic voter disenfranchisement schemes.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot
