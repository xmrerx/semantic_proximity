the u.s is the land of opportunity and dreams for many people all over the world .
the heightened profile for khairullah , a former teacher in the paterson public schools who worked at office depot , represents growing political power for muslims in new jersey politics.seven weeks ago , passaic county elected its first muslim freeholder when assad akhter , a deputy chief of staff to u.s. rep. bill pascrell and the son of pakistani immigrants , took of the seat of hector lora .
