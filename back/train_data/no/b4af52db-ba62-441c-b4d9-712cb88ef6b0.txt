washington ( reuters ) - the no .
2 u.s. house of representatives republican , majority leader kevin mccarthy , said on friday he was committed to working with president donald trump to fix the iran nuclear agreement but did not advocate ending the deal .
mccarthy is one of the congressional leaders allowed under a 2015 law to introduce legislation that , if passed , would have immediately reimposed u.s. sanctions on iran ’ s nuclear program lifted under the international nuclear accord .
his comment was an indication that the republican-controlled congress does not intend to pursue that course .
