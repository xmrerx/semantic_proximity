PARIS (Reuters) - Franceâ€™s foreign ministry on Wednesday said new U.S. sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea appeared at odds with international law due to their extra-territorial reach.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday for these sanctions, which could affect European firms.
The foreign ministry said in a statement that French and European laws would need to be adjusted in response and added that discussions would be necessary at European Union level because of the potential impact on European citizens and firms.
