buenos aires ( reuters ) - an activist whose disappearance in southern argentina in august captured the country s attention in the months before mid-term elections died of drowning and hypothermia , the judge investigating the case said on friday .
santiago maldonado had been missing from aug. 1 .
he had attended an indigenous land rights protest in patagonia that day .
his body was found on october 17 in a nearby river .
federal judge guillermo gustavo lleral told reporters outside a morgue that an autopsy showed the cause of maldonado s death was drowning and hypothermia , and that his body was in the chubut river for at least 55 days .
some government opposition and rights groups have said that state security forces took maldonado , a 28-year-old craftsman , after police reportedly clashed with mapuche indians who claim territory throughout southern argentina and chile .
the groups allegations that president mauricio macri s government covered up maldonado s whereabouts overshadowed a mid-term congressional election on oct. 22 .
macri s government has said there was no evidence that showed security forces had detained maldonado .
on friday , maldonado s brother said he would keep insisting on an investigation .
this was the cause of death , but we still do not know what happened , sergio maldonado said after a meeting with lleral .
