One of the sitting members on the Homeland Security Advisory Council s (HSAC) Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism is a 25-year-old immigrant of Syrian heritage who said that the 9/11 attacks changed the world for good and has consistently disparaged America, free speech and white people on social media.Laila Alawa was one of just 15 people tapped to serve on the newly-formed HSAC Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism in 2015 the same year she became an American citizen.
Just last week, the subcommittee submitted a report to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, recommending that the DHS avoid using Muslim terminology like the words sharia and jihad when discussing terrorism.Alawa says she immigrated into the U.S. when she was ten years old.

In April 2013, she responded to a tweet from activist Pamela Geller who called the Boston Marathon bombings jihad by tweeting: go fuck yourself.

The report also recommended that, in order to combat violent extremism, the DHS Focus on gender diversity of youth through careful attention to the range of push and pull factors that attract individuals of differing gender.
As originally reported by The Daily Caller, the subcommittee Alawa serves on instructed the DHS to begin using American English instead of religious, legal and cultural terms like jihad, sharia, takfir or umma when discussing terrorism in order to avoid offending Muslims.Two months before Secretary Johnson created the Subcommittee on Combatting Violent Extremism, Alawa tweeted: THE US HAS NEVER BEEN A UTOPIA UNLESS YOU WERE A STRAIGHT WHITE MALE THAT OWNED LAND.
