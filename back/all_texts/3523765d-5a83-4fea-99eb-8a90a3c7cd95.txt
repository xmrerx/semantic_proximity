Bill Maher finished Friday s episode of Real Time by absolutely destroying the always-failed experiment that is Republican economics.
It wasn t that hard, really.
All he did was compare Kansas, a state controlled by far right lunatics, to California, a state that purged the Republican politicians that were strangling it:California raised taxes on the wealthy.
A lot.
And our economy is booming.
We just passed France and India to become, all by ourselves, the world s 6th largest economy.How did California get its act together?
Simple, they put Democrats in charge of EVERYTHING: Democrats, from governor on down, control every office and voting body in this state.
So we can really study what happens when liberal policies are tried unimpeded.
And the only thing I have to say to Republicans about that is: scoreboard, bitches.
