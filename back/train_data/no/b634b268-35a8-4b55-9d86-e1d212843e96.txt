tallinn ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel praised the ideas of french president emmanuel macron for reform of the european union on thursday and said they could form the basis for intensive franco-german cooperation .
macron offered a sweeping vision for europe s future in a speech on tuesday , calling for the eu to cooperate more closely on defense , immigration , tax and social policy , and for the single currency bloc to have its own budget .
as far as the proposals were concerned , there was a high level of agreement between german and france .
