( reuters ) - the iowa supreme court has maintained a block on a three-day waiting period for women seeking an abortion until a legal challenge concludes , a decision cheered by abortion-rights advocates .
the provision was signed into law in may by former republican governor terry branstad , part of new regulations that also included a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks .
the waiting period portion was challenged earlier this year by the american civil liberties union of iowa and planned parenthood .
the iowa state attorney general ’ s office could not be reached for comment on tuesday .
the u.s. supreme court legalized abortion in 1973 although states can limit and regulate abortions .
u.s. state legislatures enacted 41 new abortion restrictions in the first half of 2017 , according to the guttmacher institute , a reproductive health group that supports abortion rights .
planned parenthood on tuesday praised the court ’ s decision , issued on monday , to keep in place a prior stay on the requirement that women wait 72 hours before having an abortion .
“ this ruling ensures that women in iowa will have continued access to the health care they need throughout the course of this lawsuit , ” said susan allen , a spokeswoman for planned parenthood of the heartland .
a lower court had earlier upheld the disputed provision of the law , noting that 27 states have implemented waiting periods for abortion , ranging from 18 to 72 hours , the des moines register reported on tuesday .
in may , planned parenthood said it would shutter four of its 12 clinics in iowa as a result of another iowa measure that blocked public money for family planning services to abortion providers .
