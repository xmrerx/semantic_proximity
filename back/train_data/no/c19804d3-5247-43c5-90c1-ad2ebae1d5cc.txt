dubai ( reuters ) - the united states is scaling back its involvement in some joint military exercises in the gulf region , a spokesman said on friday , following a rift between qatar and its neighbors .
saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and bahrain , along with egypt , severed ties with qatar in june , accusing it of supporting terrorism , in the most serious rift between the united states gulf arab allies .
doha denies it supports terrorism and says the sanctions are intended to force it to change its foreign policies .
asked whether the united states had scaled back military operations with some gulf cooperation council countries due to the rift , u.s. central command ( centcom ) spokesman colonel john thomas said in an emailed statement : we are opting out of some military exercises out of respect for the concept of inclusiveness and shared regional interests .
we will continue to encourage all partners to work together toward the sort of common solutions that enable security and stability in the region , he added , without elaborating .
the u.s. central command is responsible for 20 countries in the middle east and south and central asia , from egypt to kazakhstan .
the united states has sought to encourage its arab allies to discuss their differences , which appear to revolve around qatar s support for the muslim brotherhood , an islamist group designated by saudi arabia and its allies as a terrorist organization .
gulf arab states also accuse qatar of cozying up to non-arab iran , which they accuse of trying to expand its influence in arab countries by supporting shi ite muslim minorities , something tehran denies .
the united states maintains close military ties with all gulf arab states and regularly holds joint exercises .
it has military bases in several of the counties , including qatar which hosts the largest u.s. military base in the middle east .
