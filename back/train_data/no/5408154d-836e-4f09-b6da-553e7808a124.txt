washington ( reuters ) - the pentagon said on monday it was reviewing adjustments in arms for u.s.-backed kurdish forces in syria but stopped short of declaring a halt to weapons transfers , suggesting such decisions would be based on battlefield requirements .
turkey said on friday that u.s. president donald trump told president tayyip erdogan he had issued instructions that weapons should not be provided to syrian kurdish fighters , which ankara views as threat .
it called on monday for washington to follow through on its pledge .
we are reviewing pending adjustments to the military support provided to our kurdish partners in as much as the military requirements of our defeat-isis and stabilization efforts will allow to prevent isis from returning , said pentagon spokesman eric pahon , using an acronym for islamic state , which u.s. and u.s.-backed forces are battling in syria .
