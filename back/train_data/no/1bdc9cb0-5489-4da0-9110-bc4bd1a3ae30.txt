athens ( reuters ) - greece s supreme court will decide on dec. 13 whether to extradite a russian to the united states where authorities want to put him on trial for laundering $ 4 billion via a bitcoin platform .
alexander vinnik , who says he is a bitcoin consultant , is accused by u.s. authorities of running the btc-e exchange , which they allege was a conduit for laundering proceeds from illicit activities .
vinnik denies the charges and is fighting his extradition to the united states .
i don t think there is independent justice in the united states for a russian citizen , vinnik told the court in session in athens .
he also said conditions in american prisons were terrible .
addressing the court , a greek public prosecutor recommended vinnik s extradition .
the 38-year-old was arrested in northern greece on the basis of a u.s. warrant in july , one of seven russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on u.s. cybercrime charges .
since his arrest , russia has also sought vinnik s extradition there on lesser charges of fraud .
vinnik has agreed to be extradited to russia .
in competing requests of this nature , the final decision of where vinnik will be extradited rests with greece s justice minister .
