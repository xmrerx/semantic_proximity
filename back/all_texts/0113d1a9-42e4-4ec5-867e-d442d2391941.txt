It finally dawned on Glenn Beck that his buddy Sarah Palin isn t quite right in the head.
Last night on his television show, Beck expressed concern for Sarah Palin s erratic behavior lately and wondered if she suffered a brain aneurysm, according to Right Wing Watch.
The half-term Governor of Alaska had thrown her full support behind Donald Trump s bid for the White House, then after his win she attacked him for the Carrier deal, calling it Crony Capitalism.
For once in her life, she got something right but she should have known that Trump would pull such a move.
Beck called Palin s enthusiastic endorsement of Trump crazy.
Sincerely, has she had a brain aneurysm?
Beck said Monday night on his program.
Because I don t know what has happened to her.
Because before Palin attacked the Carrier deal, Trump was considering her for a cabinet position.
She s totally unqualified for the position of Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but Trump is also unqualified to be leader of the free world so it kind of makes sense he chose her.
But, Beck thought she would have done a fine job in that capacity.Beck said Palin attacking Trump over the Carrier deal is absurd, because you own it, Sarah.
You brought it to the table.
He said he would do that!
Beck and his staff members decided that maybe Palin is lashing out at Trump because she is just butt-hurt over the fact that she may not get the V.A.
secretary position after all.Watch:The political arena in this country is so insane that Glenn Beck is making sense.
Glenn.
Fucking.
Beck.
Let that sink in for a moment.Sarah Palin does own this.
Instead of draining the swamp, Trump is filling it with terrifying creatures.
Everything Trump accused Hillary Clinton of, he is doing.
Trump hasn t even been sworn in yet and he s plagued with scandals.
But, Hillary s emails were made into a scandal so he s going to be the next president.Photo: J.D.
