President Obama made history yet again by making the rate for Americans without health insurance reach another historic low.
However, you wouldn t know about it because virtually none of the mainstream media have talked about it on any level.Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index was updated on April 7th with new data for the first quarter of 2016.
The statistics have now been released, and it shows that the uninsured rate for American adults dropped to 11 percent, which is the lowest ever recorded in the poll s history.This unmitigated success has followed a trend since the third quarter of 2013, which is the last one before the Affordable Care Act s mandate for health insurance took effect.The graph below shows the virtual bottoming out of the uninsured rate.
Considering where we were as a nation only three years ago, coupled with the stubborn resistance of many in complying with the new requirements, the results are simply amazing.Not only are the results on the uninsured rate historic overall, but the largest benefits are among African-Americans, Hispanics, adults under 34 years of age, and adults making less than $36,000 per year.
If Republicans really want to repeal every word of Obamacare as they promise to do, it would literally make their party go extinct.
Young and minority voters will be lost to Republicans for a generation or more, and doom them extinction.The Republican plan during the 2016 election has been more of the same.
Repeal, repeal, repeal with no plan to replace as usual.
However, there has been a lot less talk of repeal as of late.
Even Ted Cruz, who could have I will repeal every word of Obamacare chiseled on his tombstone, has been strangely silent on the issue.
Votes to repeal have seemed to be drying up, and you hear hardly a peep coming from Senate Republicans on the matter these days.Perhaps the GOP has finally reached the last stage of grief acceptance.Featured image via Getty
