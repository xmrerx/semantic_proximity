Pretty much all of Sarah Palin s endorsement of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump was definitely off the wall.
You weren t sure if you were watching a circus performance by a lady dressed in wind chimes, a piece of visual art that you might find at the Museum of Modern Art, or a person just before they get a psych evaluation.Nonetheless, there Palin was in all her glory.
Watching her speak, you really couldn t tell if she was just really excited or maybe just really drunk.
However, her enthusiasm for Trump was most definitely spirited and could be felt through television sets across the nation by people who were dumbfounded at what they were actually witnessing.However, if there was one moment of all the crazy moments that could perfectly sum up the embodiment of Palin s long-winded endorsement of a man who shouldn t even be allowed on a tour of the White House, let alone be president, this was it:Sarah Palin s poetry to describe Trump supporters pic.twitter.com/Hl2OmGIxZT Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) January 20, 2016If you need a translator to figure out what the hell she just said, it went something like: How bout the rest of us?
Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution.
In all honesty, that s really all she needed to say.
That pretty much wraps up the modern-day Republican party full of extreme right-wing, bitter people clinging to their guns and religion and pretending to follow the Constitution.
It s also the perfect summary of her entire speech.
Everything else, along with that jumbled sentence, sounded like drunken jibber jabber to the point Donald Trump looked extremely uncomfortable standing next to her with a look of oh sh*t, what did I just do?
However, now he s stuck with her and all her unhinged glory.
Hopefully she ll bring the same luck to Trump s campaign that she brought to John McCain s.Featured image: Twitter
