Vice President Joe Biden has been a strong advocate for sexual assault victims and he is letting it be known exactly where he stands when it comes to Donald Trump bragging about being a sexual predator.During the interview on Meet The Press, Biden told NBC s Chuck Todd that when Trump boasted that he could grab em by the p*ssy, the GOP nominee was giving a textbook definition of sexual assault.
Todd asked the vice president why Trump didn t deserve to get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the sexual assault allegations against him that have been piling up.
Biden s answer was simple: His own words.
His own words, I don t even have to go to the accusers, Biden explained.
When a man says what he said, that is a textbook definition of sexual assault.
I mean, it s a textbook definition.
But what makes it believable that he engaged in that kind of activity, it s not that just that he said it, but sort of his instinctive abuse of power.
He acts like that in private sector and he acts in the way he treats employees, he continued.
You know, I live in the penthouse.
I m a billionaire, I m a star and I can do what I want.
That s the most disturbing piece!
You know, my father used to say, The greatest abuse is the abuse of power.
Economic power, political power, physical power.
And this is not a guy who should be representing the United States in anyway.
