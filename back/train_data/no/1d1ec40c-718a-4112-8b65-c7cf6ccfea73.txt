sarajevo ( reuters ) - bosnia must start making concrete reforms if it wants to join the european union , or the window to becoming a member could close , the bloc s enlargement chief said on monday .
the european union accepted bosnia s application 15 months ago - but johannes hahn said the balkan nation had not made any of the reforms or changes agreed with the bloc and international creditors .
so far nothing has been delivered .
we now expect very concrete results , hahn said after meeting political leaders .
bosnia s prime minister , denis zvizdic , said he hoped the leaders would reach a compromise on outstanding issues by later this month or early january .
the ethnically divided country has so far not managed to respond to the initial eu questionnaire on its readiness to join the bloc .
political bickering has held up a law raising excise tax on fuel , required to unlock external financing for infrastructure projects .
there has also been no sign of development and energy and agriculture sector strategies demanded by the bloc .
there are a lot of issues in the pipeline but i would like to have them through the pipeline , said hahn .
it is absolutely high time now to deliver on what has been agreed , otherwise , the window can be closed again and this is not something we all would like to see , he told a news conference .
hahn urged government and opposition leaders to stop appealing to ethnic nationalism , and said the eu would be looking for evidence of european values , including a respect for court rulings .
without that understanding one can not make any progress , he said .
