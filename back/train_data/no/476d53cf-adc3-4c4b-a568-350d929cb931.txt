warsaw ( reuters ) - mateusz morawiecki was sworn in as poland s new prime minister on monday and european council president donald tusk called on the new leader to pursue european unity .
poland s ruling law and justice party ( pis ) is at odds with the eu over immigration , logging in an ancient forest and government attempts to control the courts and the media .
critics say the eurosceptic party s policies have subverted democracy and the rule of law .
at the same time , acrimony between tusk and the pis dates back years .
poland , acting on orders from the pis boss and long-time tusk adversary jaroslaw kaczynski , was the sole member of the 28 eu members to vote in march against tusk s re-election .
morawiecki , 49 , replaced beata szydlo , who became a deputy prime minister .
pis sacked the popular szydlo last week in a bid to improve poland s image abroad and prepare the conservatives for a series of elections .
morawiecki will remain finance minister and economy minister .
all other ministers have kept their jobs for now , although some ministerial changes are expected in weeks to come .
morawiecki said his government will continue the work of szydlo .
he is expected to outline his policies on tuesday .
tusk , a former polish prime minister before pis came to power in 2015 , said he counts on good cooperation .
acting for poland s strong position in the european union and for the unity of all member states is the need of the moment , tusk wrote .
former polish president lech walesa , who is a critic of the pis said on twitter : the circus has stayed the same , only the clowns have changed their roles .
walesa led protests and strikes that shook communist rule in the 1980s .
szydlo s government was one of the most popular in poland since the 1989 collapse of communism .
it registered around 40 percent approval due to low unemployment , increases in public spending and a focus on traditional catholic values in public life .
