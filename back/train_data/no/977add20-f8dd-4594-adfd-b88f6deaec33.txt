there never seems to be a shortage of smug , know-it-all , self-righteous effeminate men supporting queen hillary .
maybe that s why there s a certain amount of pleasure hillary s every day americans derive when they see a member of the mainstream media call them out on national t.v hillary clinton campaign manager robby mook said a federal judge s ruling that clinton and her top aides should be questioned under oath about the candidate s private email server is part of the ring wing s effort to hurt her chances of becoming president he was then confronted with an inconvenient fact.asked by cnn anchor jake tapper about the latest development in the months-long email scandal , mook tried to dismiss the judge s ruling as a right-wing group s attempt to hurt clinton s chances of becoming president.tapper was quick to point out that judge emmett sullivan , who sits on the u.s. district court for the district of columbia , was appointed by clinton s own husband , bill clinton .
it s the judge s decision to make , mook responded .
my point is this was promulgated by a right-wing group .
indeed , sullivan was appointed to his current position in 1994 by then-president bill clinton.he was previously tapped in 1984 by president ronald reagan to serve as associate judge of the superior court of the district of columbia .
in 1991 , he was appointed by president george h.w .
bush to serve as associate judge of the district of columbia court of appeals , before being elevated to his current job.via : the blazeh/t weasel zippers
