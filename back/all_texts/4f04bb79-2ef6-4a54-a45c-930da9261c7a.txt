Shaming people into voting for someone now that s what I call desperation.
How about we let young women decide for themselves who they vote for without being told they ll go to hell if they don t follow in lockstep with the demands of the left.
Note to Hillary and Ms. Albright: Women can think for themselves these days.Former Sec.
of State Madeleine Albright attempted to shame young women voters at a Hillary Clinton campaign event on Saturday, repeating her now-famous line: There s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other.
Albright joined New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at a rally in Concord, N.H., just days before the nation s first presidential primary of the 2016 campaign.The 78-year-old diplomat, who served in the Bill Clinton White House, complained that some young women don t understand the importance of why young women have to support Hillary Clinton.
The story is not over, they re going to want to push us back.
Appointments to the Supreme Court make all the difference, Albright said of Republicans, adding that young women have to help and that Hillary Clinton will be there for you.
Just remember: there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other, Albright said, much to the joy of Clinton, who is seen laughing at the remark, which she has used numerous times in the past.
