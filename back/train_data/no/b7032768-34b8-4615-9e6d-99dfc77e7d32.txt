kellyanne conway went at it with anderson cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled cooper on the chain of command in government .
the facts make no sense to him because he s in denial .
conway said trump s decision to fire james comey had nothing to do with the fbi s investigation into russian interference in the presidential election .
she goes on to explain to cooper that the letter recommending that comey be fired was sent to president trump .
was trump supposed to then deny the assistant attorney general s decision ?
it s good to note that the assistant ag was just confirmed by over 90 % of the senate .
he s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under ag jeff sessions just two weeks ago .
the letter sent to trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing comey .
trump did not do this alone but you have the fake news media beating the russia , russia , russia drums over and over.watch how kellyanne conway runs circles around anderson cooper while cooper just keeps coming back to the russia scenario : it s not a cover up .
the president makes it very clear in his letter .
comey assured him he s not under investigation .
i think you re looking at wrong set of facts here .
you re going back to the campaign .
this man is president of the united states .
he acted decisively today .
you want this to be about russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the fbi the fbi director reports to deputy attorney general , the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the united states .
this has nothing to do with russia .
it has everything to do with whether the current fbi director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties .
