Poor Sean Hannity has had to struggle so hard to get respect.
On the cable news network that promotes anti-intellectualism, Hannity may be the dumbest in the bunch, so it shouldn t be a surprise to anyone that he accidentally retweeted a sarcastically pro-Russia, genuinely anti-Trump tweet.
He quickly deleted it, but not before it was captured.The original tweet came from Twitter user Donnie L il Hands, which should have been Hannity s first clue.
It wasn t. YES!
All Americans must join together to MAKE RUSSIA GREAT AGAIN.
Teamwork!!
#MRGA.
Clearly, that was a dig at Trump and his Make America Great Again slogan, but Hannity retweeted it anyway.
It was gone within about 45 minutes.The internet went nuts!#SeanHannity tweets an AMEN for making Russia great again then deletes it.Putin s like, he s the WORST Manchurian Candidate EV-UH.

@seanhannity tried to delete this.
Apparently he, like his orange god, doesn t realize a screenshot is forever.
