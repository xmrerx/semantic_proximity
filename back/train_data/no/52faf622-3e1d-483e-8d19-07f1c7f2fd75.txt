sydney - ( reuters ) - thousands of people rallied around australia on saturday urging the legalization of same-sex marriage , one week before final ballots can be submitted in a contentious postal survey on the issue that has divided the country .
the largest crowd was in sydney , where organizers said between 5,000 and 10,000 people gathered in front of central station before marching along one of the city s biggest roads to victoria park .
it s a good reflection of the enthusiasm of people , australian marriage equality s tiernan brady said .
they are very determined , very positive and not complacent .
other rallies in favor of same-sex marriage were held in the northern city of brisbane and the central hub of alice springs .
rallies organized by the coalition for marriage , the lead campaigner against same-sex marriage , also were held across the country .
the coalition , which includes the australian christian lobby and other religious groups , encouraged those who haven t returned their surveys to do so .
we re so pleased so many people have engaged with this process and we encourage those who haven t to tick no and put it in the post , spokeswoman monica doumit said .
though the postal ballot is non-binding , a yes vote is expected to lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage which could further fracture the government of prime minister malcolm turnbull .
ballots were mailed out from sept. 12 , with the australian bureau of statistics recommending all votes be returned via the postal service by oct. 27 .
the latest update from the abs , issued on oct. 17 , showed almost 11 million postal votes had been returned , about 68 per cent of the total distributed .
