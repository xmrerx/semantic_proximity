Civil Rights activist Rev.
Jesse Jackson Sr. attended the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition convention in Chicago on Thursday, where he claimed President Donald Trump stole the election.Jackson was introducing the Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez when he made the accusation against Trump.
To have a head of our party who is sensitive to the plight of working people is the order of this day, Jackson told the crowd.
Don t forget when you lose, you tend to amplify would ve, could ve, should ve.
When you win you cover up your sins.
We worked last year.
We won the election.
It was stolen, Jackson concluded.
-WFBTrump derangement syndrome is apparently alive and well with the Reverend Jesse Jackson at his Rainbow Push shakedown convention in crooked Chicago, IL.
If it wasn t so funny, we d almost feel sorry for these two bit jack-holes like Jesse Jackson, former Democrat presidential candidate, lifetime shakedown artist and father of former IL State Rep and convicted felon Jesse Jackson Jr
