paul ryan has had almost 8 years to lead the charge to impeach obama for his unlawful , unconstitutional acts against america .
where was all of the tough talk from ryan when obama was shoving obamacare down our throats ?
house speaker paul ryan ( r-wi ) has made clear he doesn t agree with a proposal put forward by donald trump whom ryan has endorsed to ban muslim immigration into the united states , but in an interview with the huffington post thursday , ryan floated taking a president trump to court if he tried to implement such a ban or some of his other controversial proposals unilaterally .
i would sue any president that exceeds his or her powers , ryan said in a back-and-forth about trump s claims that he could implement a muslim ban or build a mexican border wall without congressional approval.really paul ?
where have you been for the past year ? ryan said he wasn t sure of the legal question of whether trump could institute a muslim ban on his own as president .
that s a legal question that there s a good debate about , he said , citing the 1952 immigration and nationality act .
on the broader question , are we going to exert our article i powers and reclaim this article i power no matter who the president is ?
absolutely , ryan said .
he also said he discussed the limits of the executive power with trump.in the interview , ryan said his endorsement of real estate mogul did not give trump a blank check , and that he was still trying to achieve real unity between the presumptive nominee and his caucus .
i am going to keep being who i am , i am going to keep speaking out on things where i think it s needed , where our principles need to be defended , and i am going to keep doing that , i hope it s not necessary , ryan said .
but the last thing i want to see is a another democrat in the white house via : talking points memo
