in almost 7 years this president hasn t learned that words don t stop bullets .
he is fundamentally out of touch with human reality , with the reality of history , with the reality of warfare , and vladimir putin ruthless and vicious and ugly though he is he s the one that s on the side of history , now .
not us .
we re clinging to 20th century platitudes , and putin is changing the world .
changing the world , as we do nothing .
putin is a man of action and god help us our president is a deer caught in the headlights of history .
