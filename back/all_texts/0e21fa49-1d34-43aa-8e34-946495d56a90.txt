Whether Republican nominee Donald Trump actually ever wanted to be the next President of the United States has been under speculation for a while now, especially with rumors about a Trump TV network surfacing as his campaign came to an end.
It probably doesn t help that Trump celebrated Election Day by dissing his own presidential campaign, perhaps in early acceptance that he might come out of this defeated.In an interview with Fox and Friends on Tuesday morning, Trump decided to spend Election Day telling Americans that his campaign might very well have been a big waste of time for him.
His exact words were: If I don t win, I will consider it a waste of time, energy and money.
Seriously, could Trump be any less deserving of America s future?
His rival, Hillary Clinton, would never have called her campaign a waste and understands what an honor it is to lead this country.
To imply that he might have better things to do with his time is extremely disrespectful and ignorant of Trump, which is hardly surprising when you look back on how awful his campaign was.
You can watch Trump diss his own campaign below:What Trump s family members said on Election Day wasn t much better.
On MSNBC s Morning Joe, Donald Trump, Jr. seemed to already be accepting defeat as he spoke about what the Trump family would do after the election.
Trump s son said: [If he doesn t win,] we go back largely to doing what we re doing.
But I think hopefully he was able to create enough of a movement that forces people in the political elite, people in that political class to truly represent their people.
These interviews clearly show that Trump doesn t understand the responsibility or honor that comes with being the commander-in-chief.
We ve never had a less worthy presidential candidate, and he doesn t deserve to be elected.Featured image via Andrew Renneisen / Getty Images
