as gop candidate , donald trump walked through a packed group of supporters at a rally in sc , he was approached by a man who yelled out , i m a muslim and i support this man all the way !
the media has spent an enormous amount of time trying to convince voters that trump will never get the muslim vote because of the hate he has earned from the muslim community , after saying we need to stop allowing un-vetted muslim refugees to enter our country.look for this exchange to be used in future trump ads :
