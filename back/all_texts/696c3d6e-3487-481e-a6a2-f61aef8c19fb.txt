The man who won two Super Bowls for the city of Pittsburgh says that he now regrets the fact that he and his Steelers teammates refused to stand on the field for the national anthem during Sunday s game.
Now he regrets it?
How is it that these athletes didn t feel strongly enough BEFORE the anthem to stand up?
Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger says he regrets standing in tunnel with team for national anthem pic.twitter.com/4hkoC8o7o1 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) September 25, 2017 I was unable to sleep last night and want to share my thoughts and feelings on our team s decision to remain in the tunnel for the National Anthem yesterday.
RoethlisbergerCAN T YOU BE UNIFIED AS A TEAM BY STANDING FOR THE ANTHEM?
The idea was to be unified as a team when so much attention is paid to things dividing our country, but I wish we approached it differently.
We did not want to appear divided on the sideline with some standing and some kneeling or sitting.
He closed out by saying: I appreciate the unique diversity in my team and throughout the league and completely support the call for social change and the pursuit of true equality.
Moving forward, I hope standing for the Anthem shows solidarity as a nation, that we stand united in respect for the people on the front lines protecting our freedom and keeping us safe.
God bless those men and women.
He also spoke on Monday during practice in Pittsburgh and confirmed that the Steelers will not skip the anthem again this season.
