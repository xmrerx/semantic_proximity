Students at the University of California, San Diego, were shocked this week when Muslim internment flyers were posted around the campus.NBC 7, a local channel in San Diego, report that the flyers were posted on billboards around the campus and took the form of Internment Notices, which signaled the roundup of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II.
But these notices targeted Muslims.
The poster read, in part: All Muslim persons, both alien and non-alien, will be evacuated from the above designated area by 12:00 o clock noon Wednesday, April 8, 2017.
No Muslim person will be permitted to enter or leave the above described area after 8:00 a.m., Thursday, April 2, 2017, without obtaining special permission from the Provost Marshal at the Civil Control Station A person claiming responsibility for the flyers emailed NBC and explained that the posters were not intended to be anti-Muslim.
Instead, the goal was to shock and anger people by using our own shameful past of Japanese internment camps to warn people about the path we are currently on.
The posters were meant to mimic the internment posters because I wanted to shock/anger people and to show them what could happen if they didn t do anything to stop it.
It was a warning presented as a possible future, the email read.The flyers appeared on the same day that Donald Trump signed his updated executive order banning citizens of several Muslim majority countries from entering the United States.This time, only six countries are included in the ban since Iraq has been excluded from the list.
The updated version also outlines exclusions for valid visa holders, green card holders, and several other groups.
Reportedly, Trump decided not to give preferential treatment to Christians in the updated ban either.
To avoid the chaos the order created last time, there is a 10-day grace period before the bigoted ban kicks in on March 16.Featured image via Twitter and Wikimedia Commons
