Donald Trump has taken a beating on his favorite playground Twitter from many notable individuals (and multiple dictionaries), so the Pope decided to try to reach The Donald that way.Pope Francis has tried in every way possible to reach Trump, including a direct inauguration-day message and multiple statements indirectly condemning the policies of our resident Manchurian couch potato, all to no avail.
Despite his best efforts, Donald Trump is still a useless, racist, xenophobe who hates the poor and anyone too brown or too Muslimy for his small-minded world view.
Recently, many of His Holiness tweets seem to be directed at Mr. Trump.
I invite you not to build walls but bridges, to conquer evil with good, offence with forgiveness, to live in peace with everyone, Pope Francis posted on Saturday, a clear reference to The Big Beautiful Wall That Will Solve All of America s Problems.I invite you not to build walls but bridges, to conquer evil with good, offence with forgiveness, to live in peace with everyone.
Pope Francis (@Pontifex) March 18, 2017At around the time the White House announced the budget one that guts social programs like Meals on Wheels that are aimed at helping the disadvantaged was announced, the Pope reminded everyone that people who actually follow the teachings of the Bible love life, especially when it is weak and vulnerable.
Of course, this could easily be a reference to the GOP s ongoing effort to strip healthcare from our most poor and vulnerable.The word of God helps us to open our eyes to welcome and love life, especially when it is weak and vulnerable.
Pope Francis (@Pontifex) March 15, 2017The prior day, Pope Francis reminded us to open our doors to the weak and poor.
Let us pray for one another so that we may open our doors to the weak and poor.
Pope Francis (@Pontifex) March 14, 2017Naturally, people who call themselves Christians are not happy with the Pope:@Pontifex easier said than done when a society (Muslim) wants to destroy anything Christian (and has).

(@Cruncher19621) March 18, 2017@Pontifex You really think after 1500 years you can convert Muslims?
They are evil.
The devil will not allow it.
