sunday , gotnews reported that the primary source of the white house leak was traced back to deputy chief of staff and # nevertrumper kate walsh .
the goal was to undermine the trump presidency and administration.walsh is being investigated as a primary person of interest and is said to have been distributing highly confidential information to the new york times and others .
from got news : everyone knows not to talk to her in the white house unless you want to see it in the press , says a source close to the president .
the only question is whether or not she s doing it at the behest of [ white house chief of staff ] reince priebus or if she s doing it to advance herself in dc media circles .
walsh would have significant access as she controls the president s schedule .
there s also reportedly a trove of e-mails where katie walsh and reince priebus discuss how to rid themselves of trump , according to a former # nevertrump consultant .
the president and his allies have been deliberately feeding her fake information in order to find her network , says a source close to the president s family .
it s been going well .
walsh was a # nevertrump republican during the campaign .
