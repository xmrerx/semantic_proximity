brussels ( reuters ) - european council president donald tusk said on tuesday that it was up to britain to determine if there was to be a good deal or no deal in brexit talks .

if we fail it , the negotiations will end in our defeat .
we must keep our unity regardless of the direction of the talks .
the eu will be able to rise to every scenario as long as we are not divided , tusk , who chairs summits of eu leaders , told the european parliament .
it is in fact up to london how this will end , with a good deal , no deal or no brexit but in each of these scenarios we will protect our common interests only by being together , he said .
