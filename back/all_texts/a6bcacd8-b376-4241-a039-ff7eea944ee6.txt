On the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii many have been remembering all those who lost their lives on that fateful day.
It was what brought the United States into WWII and the date, as FDR said, will live in infamy.
Yet, as most treat December 7, as a solemn day, Newt Gingrich just tweeted out what sounded like praise for what the Japanese did to us that dreadful day.Gingrich tweeted out: 75 years ago the Japanese displayed professional brilliance and technological power launching surprises from Hawaii to the Philippines.

Really?
That s what Gingrich thinks of when he think of the attacks on Pearl Harbor.
How the Japanese surprised attacked us?2.403 Americans died during the attack at Pearl Harbor, with 1,178 wounded.Gingrich thinks that is professional brilliance ?This tweet is absolutely disrespectful to all those who lost their lives and their families.
There really couldn t be a more weird and awkward tweet to put out on the day we remember Pearl Harbor.And while relations with Japan have since been mended, we must never think what they did that day was at all brilliant.
For goodness sake, someone please take away Gingrich s Twitter privileges.
He clearly is out of his mind, much like his pal Donald Trump.Featured Photo by National Archive/Newsmakers
