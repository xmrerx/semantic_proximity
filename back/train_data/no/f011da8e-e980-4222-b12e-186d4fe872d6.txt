washington ( reuters ) - u.s .
senator ben cardin , the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee , said on wednesday he does not expect an upcoming vote on a $ 700 million sale of f-16 fighter jets to pakistan to keep the deal from going ahead .
however , he said there was still discussion of whether u.s. taxpayer funds could be used to finance the purchase .
president barack obama ’ s administration announced on feb. 12 that it had approved the sale of the lockheed martin corp ( lmt.n ) aircraft as well as radars and other equipment to pakistan .
it drew immediate criticism from india and concern from some members of congress .
republican senator rand paul in late february invoked legislation known as the arms export control act in the hope of stopping the sale by passing a resolution of disapproval , calling pakistan “ an uncertain ally. ” cardin told reporters he opposed paul ’ s resolution and expected it would fail , with the chamber ’ s republican and democratic leaders opposing it .
the measure could be taken up by the senate as soon as thursday .
cardin said lawmakers had concerns about pakistan ’ s nuclear program , commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the afghanistan peace process but generally supported the sale .
“ it was not controversial that pakistan needs to modernize its air force and its counter insurgency and counter-terrorism activities , particularly in the mountainous territory of the border with afghanistan , ” he said .
congress is currently considering a request to “ reprogram ” some funds , in other words , use them for a different purpose than allocated in a budget bill , to help finance the deal .
cardin said he was not yet prepared to make a judgment on whether u.s. taxpayer funds should be used to help pakistan with the purchase .
