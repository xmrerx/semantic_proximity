The president-elect on Monday took issue with a photo of himself used by CNN for the cover of its book about the 2016 election.
Donald Trump took to Twitter to write, @CNN just released a book called Unprecedented which explores the 2016 race & victory.
Hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017This is the book cover:Get the 2017 inaugural edition of CNN s book Unprecedented in stores or online https://t.co/3ix857A9E5 pic.twitter.com/m23kFq7Y49 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 2, 2017This isn t the first time Trump put his massive ego on display.
He never learns.
In late November, he yelled at reporters for using a picture of him which showed his multiple chins.
Ever since, people have been tweeting out the image he dislikes so much.
Well, it s happening again.The Internet responded to the tragically insecure president-elect s tweet with impunity.
Twitter users are looking for the picture in question.
(Psst: It s in the above linked tweet).This is apparently the photo the Mirror-Gazer in Chief hates.
Make sure not to retweet it!

Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) January 2, 2017@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @CNN he probably thought that book was about him.
Subverting Trump (@rationalsquad) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump @CNN Now the president elect is whining about a photo they used.
Jesus.
What a clown.

@realDonaldTrump @CNN I hope it s this one!!
pic.twitter.com/KpOUkPcNIQ Matthew D Ambrosio (@drmattdambrosio) January 2, 2017The reason for his meltdown, as Brian Stelter explains, was likely because he was on CNN talking about the Unprecedented book and Trump s doubts he would win.
Then he tweets about both.
Coincidences?

Wait until he has to endure what President Obama was put through for 8 years.
It s called karma and he s going to get a massive dose of it.Photo by Isaac Brekken/Getty.
