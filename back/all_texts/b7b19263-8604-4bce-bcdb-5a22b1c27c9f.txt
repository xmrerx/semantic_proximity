Republicans are beginning to jump ship, and are now becoming members of the growing Never Trump train.
Senators are denouncing him, some flat out refuse to endorse him, and now some are starting to un-endorse him.Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the Republicans refusing to endorse, is urging his GOP colleagues to rescind their endorsements of Donald Trump, like Senator Mark Kirk did on Tuesday.Comparing the Republican nominee to Joe McCarthy, Graham told the New York Times that Republicans cannot justify supporting Trump after his comments regarding Judge Ganzalo Curiel:This is the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.
If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it.
There ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary.Nice little pun he included.
And kudos for Graham to call out his party for hating Clinton more than they love their country.It s not known if Graham has been in contact with any Senate Republicans on the issue, but Susan Collins, who has not expressively endorsed Trump, claimed she was holding out for a redemption before making a decision.The contingency for Republicans rests on Trump s ability to retract or tone down rhetoric regarding the Judge and Mexicans overall.
However, Bloomberg reported that Trump and his surrogates plan on ramping up the attacks.
That should go over well for vulnerable Senators down the road.If Mark Kirk wants to help keep his GOP majority, he ll be calling on Ron Johnson, Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey, Richard Burr and the rest of the vulnerables to quickly and unequivocally denounce Trump and rescind endorsements.Heed Graham s warnings, Republicans.
He shouldn t have to beg them.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
