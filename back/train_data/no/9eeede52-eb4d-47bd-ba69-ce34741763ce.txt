the city of biloxi , mississippi tweeted out a notice to all its residences friday afternoon saying that non-emergency offices will be closed this coming monday .
monday is when the country is officially observing martin luther king , jr. s birthday , so that makes sense .
but their notice didn t say mlk day , martin luther king day , martin luther king , jr. s birthday , or anything like that .
no , they tweeted out the following : image via twitteryes , seriously , they re calling mlk day great americans day .
so twitter is busy blowing them to smithereens for it , as well they should : @ cityofbiloxi ( even the state calendar of holidays doesn t say it .
maybe you got mixed up with six flags great america ?

@ cityofbiloxi i m terrified to learn what you call black history month roland scahill ( @ rolandscahill ) january 14 , 2017one would think that biloxi would take an opportunity to say something like , sorry , we screwed that up , we apologize for being a bunch of racists here , but they didn t. noooo they said this instead : image via twitterthe funny thing is that the state s website doesn t say great americans day under their list of state holidays , and a quick search on google reveals a whole ton of nothing .
there are great americans days everywhere , but they re celebrated all year long .
so who renamed mlk day if it wasn t biloxi ? there might be some interesting goings-on in biloxi next tuesday.featured image by chris graythen via getty images
