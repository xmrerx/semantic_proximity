skopje ( reuters ) - a macedonian court sentenced 33 ethnic albanians to jail terms on thursday , including seven given life sentences , after they were found guilty of plotting attacks and clashing with the police in a 2015 shootout in which 22 people were killed .
the 33 were accused of being part of a group of albanian gunmen involved in the may 9 , 2015 shootout with police in the northern macedonian town of kumanovo , in which eight police officers were among those killed and dozens were wounded .
some of the defendants were from neighboring kosovo , while others were from macedonia s own albanian minority .
the evidence offered by the prosecutor shows that the accused committed the criminal acts of terrorism and terrorist organization , the presiding judge said .
the court was under heavy police protection , with helicopters flying overhead .
the defendants protested while the verdict was being read , prompting the judge to order 33 of them to leave the courtroom before hearing sentences .
the 2015 shootout occurred during a police raid that followed an attack by armed men on a border post .
some of them were former guerrillas from the national liberation army ( nla ) , an ethnic albanian militia that had fought an insurgency in 2001 in which scores of people were killed .
the nla disbanded in 2002 and some of its former leaders entered the government .
naser raufi , one of the defense lawyers , said the trial was staged and that he did not expect to see such lengthy sentences .
this calls for an independent investigation , he said .
macedonia , a small ex-yugoslav republic of about two million people , declared independence in 1991 and mostly avoided the violence that accompanied the break up of yugoslavia in the 1990s , until the clashes with ethnic albanian fighters in 2001 .
albanians are believed to make up around 30 percent of macedonia s population , living mostly in the northwest near the borders with kosovo and albania .
