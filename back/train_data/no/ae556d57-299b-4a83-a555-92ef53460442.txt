the enquirer is placed by publix between other tabloids that do not have censor shields blocking their covers.trump s name and photo was featured on the front page of the enquirer on issues dated november 28 , december 5 , 12 , 19 , 26 in 2016 and the most recent issue dated january 2 , 2017 that featured the trump family on the cover .
the publication dates are generally about a week-and-a-half ahead of the actual date the issue is released for sale .
