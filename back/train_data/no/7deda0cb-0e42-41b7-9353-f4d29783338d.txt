a clear violation of obama s lopsided deal with iran hey barry do you still think iran wants to be our friend ?
what was the rush for america to cave to iran while totally ignoring their nuclear ambitions ?
iran unveiled a new underground missile depot on tuesday with state television showing emad precision-guided missiles in store which the united states says can take a nuclear warhead and violate a 2010 u.n. security council resolution.the defiant move to publicize iran s missile program seemed certain to irk the united states as it plans to dismantle nearly all sanctions on iran under a breakthrough nuclear agreement.tasnim news agency and state television video said the underground facility , situated in mountains and run by iran s revolutionary guards , was inaugurated by the speaker of parliament , ali larijani .
release of one-minute video followed footage of another underground missile depot last october.the united states says the emad , which iran tested in october , would be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and u.s. officials say washington will respond to the emad tests with fresh sanctions against iranian individuals and businesses linked to the program.iran s boasting about its missile capabilities are a challenge for u.s. president barack obama s administration as the united states and european union plan to dismantle nearly all international sanctions against tehran under the nuclear deal reached in july .
