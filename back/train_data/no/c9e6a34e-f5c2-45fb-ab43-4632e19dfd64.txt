( reuters ) - president donald trump on friday was dealt his biggest blow since taking office just over two months ago when house republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the u.s. healthcare system .
throughout his presidential campaign and since taking office , trump had repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace obamacare , the signature domestic achievement of his democratic predecessor , barack obama .
below are a sampling of tweets that trump posted in march on his plans to repeal obamacare , followed by comments from trump on friday after his fellow republicans yanked the plan .
