are you aware that the secret service has an obligation to protect trump from harm by these pathetic basement dwellers ?
how is the secret service supposed to determine if the flying objects being lobbed at the motorcade are starbucks cups from the anti-capitalists punk protestors molotov cocktails ?
here is the video footage of trump s motorcade barreling through the police barricade : it appears there was a security failure by allowing a horde of anti-trump protesters with a history of violence across the state and nation to gather en masse within feet of trump s departing motorcade at a vulnerable point as it crept out of the service entrance for the arena and had to make a hard turn off a driveway exit ramp .
the apparent high-speed detour through the police line moments later seems to have been a corrective action.via : gateway pundit
