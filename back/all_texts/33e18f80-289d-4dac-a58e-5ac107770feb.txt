Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez didn t mince words when he called out the GOP for their appalling health care plan.
Their plan would have resulted in tens of millions of Americans being without insurance coverage by the end of the next decade.
Perez made his point loud and clear when he explained that the reason Republicans are okay with this plan is because they just don t give a sh*t about people.
Perez made the comments at an event for the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, which was broadcast live on Facebook.
While speaking to the crowd, he discussed Republicans failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last month.The DNC chair said that Trump wants his name on everything, but for some reason, he didn t want his name associated with the GOP s Make America Sick Again plan in any way, shape, or form.
Well I ll tell you my idea, because you know what embodies their program?
I don t care, Perez said of the GOP s health care plan, prompting a round of applause from the crowd.
Because they don t give a s about people.
Perez served as former President Barack Obama s Labor secretary and was elected as chairman of the DNC in February.
His first act in this new role was to nominate Rep. Keith Ellison, who had run against him for the position, as his deputy.You can watch Perez slam the GOP and their wealth care plan in the video below, via the New Jersey Working Families Alliance: Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images
