A teenage girl in Texas was sent to the hospital Saturday after one of her responsible, gun owning relatives turned a simple family gathering into an afternoon of terror.
While the NRA encourages gun owners to take their weapons everywhere, to act as the last hope if a bad guy with a gun rears his ugly head, a simple Spring family barbecue serves as the latest example of why the hero-worship of everyone who straps a piece of metal to their thigh (or wherever) is not only irresponsible it s dangerous.
It was crazy, like you would never expect somebody to bring a gun to a barbecue or a family gathering at all, said neighbor Micah Stewart, who witnessed the shooting.Neighbor Rasheed Seals says that the incident all began with two people at the gathering having a water gun fight.
Unfortunately, one of the participants brought a real gun to the party: We come around here to get home and there s two people playing, like they re having a water gun fight.
Stewart says that the responsible gun owner proved himself to be anything but responsible as he was drying off: The man went over there to his car to get his dry clothes and he must have had the gun so he started playing with it and tried to do this and I thought he probably had it on safety and he accidentally shot the girl in her collar bone area.
The bullet struck a mere inch from the 15-year-old victim s neck.
A stray bullet also hit a car about five houses away.
Fortunately, no one else was hurt.Harris County Constable Lt. Daniel Garza explained that Cy Creek EMS tended to the female who is reported to be in stable condition, though it is not clear if the shooter surely a good guy with a gun the NRA and its acolytes will immediately disavow will be charged with a crime.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured Image via screengrab
