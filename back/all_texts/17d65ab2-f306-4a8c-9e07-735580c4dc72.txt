During a brief photo-op in the Oval Office, Canada s Prime Minister was forced to ensure something most of us would never dream of doing: touching Donald Trump.
The two shook hands for the cameras a handshake that lasted a full 13 seconds less than Trump s recent one with Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
All in all, it was an inconsequential moment but the moments leading up to the moment Justin Trudeau realized he had to make skin-to-skin contact with The Donald caught the attention of the nation.As Trump extended his hand, Trudeau stared at it like it was a pile of sh*t he had just been asked to eat on a reality show.An accurate representation of what Canadians think of us #TrudeauMeetsTrump pic.twitter.com/pWvnmxSvgo Elisabeth Ashlee (@lis_ashlee) February 13, 2017Justin Trudeau is looking at Trump's hand like he just read the Russian Dossier pic.twitter.com/XGpGF7O7LG Matthew A.

#TrudeauMeetsTrump pic.twitter.com/s2uZbgka2g Chris Daniels (@sirchrisdaniels) February 13, 2017Trudeau was pretty clearly embarrassed by having to shake Trump s hand, but he was doing his best not to ruffle any feathers so he took that moment like a champ.
While Canada s leader acted in a manner befitting his office (unlike a certain orange buffoon we know), he has been quite critical of The Donald in the past.Asked about Trump before he was sworn into office, Trudeau told reporters, there are things that we hold dear that the Americans haven t prioritized.
Then he explained what some of those things are: And I m never going to shy away from standing up for what I believe in, he said, whether it s proclaiming loudly to the world that I am a feminist, whether it s understanding that immigration is a source of strength for us and Muslim Canadians are an essential part of the success of our country today and into the future.
Trudeau added that he hoped to nevertheless have a constructive working relationship with the incoming American administration, saying, These are issues that are things we can have discussions on and respectful disagreements on with our neighbors to the south, if indeed we have to have disagreements on them.
The last thing Canadians expect, Trudeau said during his visit, is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves.
Trudeau was polite, but he may be our greatest ally in opposing Donald Trump s hateful agenda That s the fear expressed by right-wing vomit-bin and unofficial Trump propaganda outlet, Breitbart, anyway.Trudeau is everything an American President should be.
Can we just, you know, surrender to Canada?Featured image via screengrab
