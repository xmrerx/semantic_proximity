George W. Bush is back to put the nail in the coffin of his family name and his brother s presidential campaign, with a little help from Jimmy Kimmel.Earlier this month, former President George W. Bush narrated an ad on behalf of his brother Jeb Bush in an effort to put a third Bush in the White House.It certainly appears to be an act of desperation on Jeb Bush s part if he has to resort to asking his brother to campaign for him, especially since W s legacy poisoned the GOP over the last two presidential elections.And as Jeb and George campaign in South Carolina in an effort to pull off a miracle victory in a state where Jeb is currently polling at 10 percent, a full 28 points behind front-runner Donald Trump and 12 points behind Ted Cruz, this appears to be Jeb s last gasp on the campaign trail.And so, Jimmy Kimmel decided to help Jeb by releasing his own version of the ad reminding us just how dimwitted George W. Bush was during his eight years in office.
America needs help, a Bush sound-alike begins.
Parents can t put food on their families and our children still isn t learning.
I know Jeb.
I know his good heart.
It s inside his body next to other things, like his stomach, which is where his snacks go.
I know that and I know that experience in judgement count in the Oval Office, which is the room where the president works at his desk.
That s where my little brother would work if he were president.
Don t bet on it but don t underestimate Jeb either.
He s got a cute little wife and he s a good little guy.
And he knows how to open doors for America.
Cue President Bush trying and failing to open a door after a speech as the audience laughed their asses off.Here s the video via YouTube.This was the perfect ad and it demonstrates why Jeb Bush would have been much better off leaving his brother at home.
At least he could have lost with what s left of his dignity.
Now he has none.
