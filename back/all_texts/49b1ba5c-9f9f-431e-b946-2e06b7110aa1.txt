SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singaporean bodybuilder has died after a celebrity Muay Thai fight against former Singapore Idol contestant Steven Lim in the city-state, the event organiser and local media said.
The match on Saturday was the 32-year-old Pradip Subramanian s first Muay Thai fight, the Straits Times newspaper reported on Sunday.
Subramanian was a late replacement for Lim s original opponent, Sylvester Sim, who pulled out because of insurance issues.

Subramanian died at the Singapore General Hospital at about 1300 GMT on Saturday, Asia Fighting Championship said in an emailed statement.
According to the preliminary medical report released by Singapore General Hospital, Mr. Pradip Subramanian suffered a cardiac arrest respiratory failure episode which led to his passing, the statement said, adding the final medical report would be released in 30 to 60 days.
Lim said in a Facebook post: Rest in peace, my really truly respected fearless warrior and fighter and awesome boxing instructor, Pradip Subramanian!!
