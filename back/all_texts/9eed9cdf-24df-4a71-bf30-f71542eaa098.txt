MOSCOW (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said in an interview with Russian state television that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could become a natural ally to Damascus if he shows he is sincere about fighting terrorism.
“If Trump can genuinely fight against terrorism, he can be our natural ally,” Assad, speaking through an interpreter, said in the interview which was broadcast on Wednesday.
Assad said he was encouraged by Trump’s declarations during the election campaign about fighting violent Islamists and not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.
But it was unclear if Trump would carry through on those promises once in office, Assad said.
