HELSINKI (Reuters) - A senior politician in Finland s euroskeptic Finns Party said on Tuesday he would step down from the leadership of the party, formerly part of a coalition government, after harassing a lawmaker in parliament.
Finnish media quoted a female MP from another party as saying that Teuvo Hakkarainen, a deputy chairman of the nationalist Finns Party, last week grabbed her neck and kissed her in parliament caf despite her objections.
I am very sorry for what happened, alcohol does not suit me ...
I have hurt (her), Hakkarainen said in his Facebook page.
I will step down from the position of the party s second deputy chairman.
Finns Party s lawmakers issued a warning to Hakkarainen over the incident, saying any harassment was unacceptable.
Hakkarainen will remain a member of the Finns Party parliamentary group.
Hakkarainen was part of a new hard-line leadership nominated by the party in June, a development that led to it being kicked out of the government by Prime Minister Juha Sipila.
More than half of its lawmakers subsequently left the party and formed a new group to keep their government seats.
The Finns Party, formerly called True Finns , rose from obscurity during the euro zone debt crisis with an anti-EU platform, complicating the bloc s bailout talks with troubled states.
Hakkarainen was fined earlier this year for a Facebook post calling for a Muslim-free Finland which a district court said amounted to agitation against an ethnic group.
The party currently has polling support of about eight percent, down from 18 percent in 2015 general election.
