msnbc s brian williams spoke the truth on tuesday night when he said that it is the media s job to scare people to death over north korea .
wow !
these are the first true words this serial liar has spoken in years ! williams commented that he thought secretary of state rex tillerson s tone was different from president trump s north korea stance.andrea mitchell couldn t wait to jump in and criticize trump : there s pressure .
this could have been a signal to beijing as well ; listen up , take this seriously .
it could have been president trump sending signals in a number of directions .
the next comment from mitchell is hysterical because she uses two of the most anti-trump people in congress to say that even they criticized trump s tone : senators dianne feinstein and john songbird mccain wouldn t respond positively to pretty much anything that trump said.brian williams then delivered his truth bomb : malcolm , our job tonight actually is to scare people to death on this subject so the talk isn t as free as it is about a preemptive or a surgical military strike .
you know that part of the world .
the population centers , andrea and the general have talked about , south korea , the japanese , and so on and so on .
what was williams thinking ?
he let the cat out of the bag and actually told the truth .
the lefty media is frothing at the mouth to make president trump out to be clueless on strategy when in reality trump is a master strategist !
he s also surrounded himself with great military leaders ! would this crew of armchair quarterbacks want trump to do what previous leaders did and kick the can down the road ?
it s no thanks to those weak kneed leaders that we re in the position we re in now with north korea !
