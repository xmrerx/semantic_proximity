brasilia ( reuters ) - brazilian police on friday said they arrested former minister geddel vieira lima on new charges after a corruption probe found his fingerprints in bags hiding more than 51 million reais ( $ 16.52 million ) in cash .
vieira lima was in charge of president michel temer s relations with congress until november .
he had been under house arrest since july , accused of obstruction of justice for allegedly trying to deter entrepreneur l cio funaro , who worked for politicians close to temer , from striking a plea bargain deal with prosecutors .
judge vallisney de souza oliveira said in a ruling authorizing the arrest that it was necessary to stop lima from committing other crimes .
police took hours to calculate the exact amount of money found in boxes and bags earlier this week at an apartment in salvador , in the nation s biggest-ever cash seizure .
when lima resigned from his cabinet post in november , he was the fifth minister to leave the administration over graft allegations .
temer himself was later charged by the country s top prosecutor of corruption , an accusation he managed to defeat through a lower house vote in august .
lima s lawyer , gamil foppel , said his client had no access to the court documents about the evidence found by police , in clear violation of the law .
