wow !
this is fantastic !
we highly recommend the entire video : office of management and budgets ( omb ) director mick mulvaney outlines the structure , intents and purposes of the trump administration fiscal year 2018 budget the taxpayers budget the best part of this great news conference is when a reporter asks about cuts to climate science programs : at the 17:00 mark mick mulvaney rips into the reporter and it s just awesome ! we recommend the entire video because you ll see trump hired one smart cookie !
mick mulvaney knows the budget and handles the press beautifully !
