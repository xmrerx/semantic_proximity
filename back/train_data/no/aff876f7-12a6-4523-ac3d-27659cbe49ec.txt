washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. treasury department on monday sanctioned a network of individuals and companies it said counterfeited yemeni bank notes potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars for iran revolutionary guard s qods force .
the network circumvented european export restrictions in order to provide the counterfeiting supplies and equipment , according to a treasury statement .
president donald trump last month declared iran s revolutionary guard a supporter of terrorism and authorized treasury to impose tough sanctions limiting its access to goods and funding .
republican trump has been critical of the 2015 agreement his predecessor , former president barack obama , a democrat , reached with iran and said the united states must take stronger steps to ensure the country does not acquire nuclear weapons .
the counterfeiting scheme exposed the deep levels of deception that the qods force , a revolutionary guard unit carrying out missions outside the country , employs against companies in europe , governments in the gulf , and the rest of the world to support its destabilizing activities , said treasury secretary steven mnuchin .
according to treasury , pardavesh tasvir rayan co. is a printing operation controlled by businessman reza heidari and owned by tejarat almas mobin holding that procured equipment and materials to print counterfeit yemeni rial bank notes .
qods force used the currency to support its activities .
heidari used front companies and other methods to keep european suppliers in the dark about their ultimate customer .
he coordinated with mahmoud seif , tejarat s managing director , on the logistics of procuring materials and moving them into iran , treasury said .
treasury sanctioned both men and both companies , as well as forent technik gmbh , which heidari owns , and printing trade center gmbh for serving as front companies in the operation .
