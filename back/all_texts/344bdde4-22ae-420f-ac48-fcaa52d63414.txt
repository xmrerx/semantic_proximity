(Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Monday that a widespread vaccine to combat the Zika virus will likely not be available for years.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters during a briefing at the White House that initial steps are under way but health officials believe it is “unlikely to have vaccine that’s widely available for a few years.”
