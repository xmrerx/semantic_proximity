chicago ( reuters ) - an illinois man accused of abducting a chinese visiting scholar at the university of illinois faces a new charge of kidnapping resulting in death and was arraigned on wednesday .
yingying zhang , a 26-year-old visiting scholar from southeastern china at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign , disappeared on june 9 .
officials believe zhang is dead , although no body has been found .
brendt christensen , a former master s student at the university , faces one count of kidnapping resulting in death and two counts of making a false statement to the federal bureau of investigation , according to an oct. 3 indictment , which alleged the crime involved torture or serious physical abuse to the victim .
christensen pleaded not guilty to all charges , the u.s. district clerk s office in urbana , illinois said on wednesday .
a lawyer for christensen declined comment .
previously christensen , 28 , was charged with one count of kidnapping and pleaded not guilty in july .
zhang , who had been studying photosynthesis and crop productivity at the university , was last seen when a security camera recorded her getting into a black car that authorities linked to christensen , according to court documents .
christensen was placed under surveillance by federal agents who heard him talking about how he kidnapped zhang , court records said .
a jury trial is scheduled for feb. 27 , the clerk s office said .
conviction of kidnapping resulting in death carries a sentence of mandatory life in prison or death .
in august , zhang s family asked president donald trump to provide additional resources to help find her .
a lawyer for zhang s family did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
the new indictment also said christensen told fbi agents that he stayed at his apartment , slept and played video games all day on june 9 .
the indictment said that was a lie and that he had picked up zhang as she waited for a bus .
