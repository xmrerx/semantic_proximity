It s Memorial Day Weekend so, along with last week being Fleet Week in New York City, The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon had to come up with something to celebrate all those troops being in town.
Fallon s tribute?
A song called, I ve Got Friends On All Bases, which he and Adam Sandler sang to an audience full of service men and women from all five branches of the military.Fallon began the song with: Well I ll tell you the truth, I love all the troops, protectin the land, sea and air.
Sandler chimed in with: Now you re back in town, keepin us safe and sound, from that crazy-ass Elmo in Times Square.
They both sang that they have friends from the Navy, up to the Air Force Aces; the Army Greens, Coast Guard and Marines, being absolutely certain to include everyone in their comedic piece of music.
It s especially fitting since we still have lots of troops in the Middle East, and may send a lot more there (and everywhere else) if Donald Trump gets elected in November.But while the song itself was amusing (to say the least), it was the troops reaction to the song that was the real treat of the evening.
Watch below, via The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon: I ve Got Friends On All Bases is a parody of Garth Brooks I ve Got Friends In Low Places, which Fallon and Sandler clearly had a lot of fun with.
However, it s a good bet that their audience of soldiers had even more fun than they did.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
