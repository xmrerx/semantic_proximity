CNN host Don Lemon has had it with conservatives who claim things are fake news just because they disagree.
He got that point across loud and clear when he suddenly cut a segment short rather than let a guest continue to argue that the network is pushing fake news stories.Lemon was moderating a panel discussion regarding the expense of Trump s weekend trips to his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida.
But when Paris Dennard, a political analyst and commentator, finally got a chance to give his opinion things went completely off the rails.
Dennard declared that the entire topic they were discussing was fake news.
The president is not breaking any laws, and he s not doing anything, Dennard said.But Lemon wasn t having it.
The CNN host cut Dennard off and decided to educate him and the viewers at home about just what the term fake news actually means.
Fake news is when you put out a story to intentionally deceive someone and you know that it is wrong, he said.
This story that we re doing right now is not to intentionally deceive anyone.
We are simply talking about the cost to keep a president safe, he continued.
Please stop it with that stupid talking point, that it is a fake news story.
If you don t want to participate in the news stories on this network, then don t come on and participate.
But don t call them fake because you don t agree with them.
Go on.
Dennard was given another chance to speak, but he still insisted that this is a fake news story.
And at that point, Lemon had had enough and yanked Dennard off the air, abruptly ending the segment rather than let Dennard continue to undermine the press with his bogus claims.Watch the segment below: Featured image via video screen capture
