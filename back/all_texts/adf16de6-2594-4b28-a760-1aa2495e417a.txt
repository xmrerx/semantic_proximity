Coolest.
President.
Ever.During his scheduled stop in Buenos Aires, Argentina, President Obama was asked to stand up and dance as a tango played at the State Dinner that took place at the Centro Cultural Kirchner on Wednesday night.After a pair of professional Argentine dancers finished performing for President Obama and the First Lady, the duo split off and asked the First Couple to do the tango with them.At first, President Obama politely declined but the beautiful woman in the gold dress finally got her wish.President Obama was every bit the gentleman and smoothly danced the Argentine Tango with his excited partner, proving once again that he is the President of Cool.Obama participated in the dance for a minute and then he returned to his table while the lady in the gold dress embraced First Lady Michelle Obama who looked just as surprised by her husband s moves.Here s the video via YouTube.Can you imagine Donald Trump or Ted Cruz pulling off the tango like President Obama did?
Such a nightmarish image would be humiliating for this country and the presidency similar to all those times former President George W. Bush tried his hand at dancing at the White House like when he invited a a group of Africans to the Rose Garden in 2007.But Trump and Cruz would likely top Bush by being more embarrassing and even scarier.As President Obama continues to strengthen U.S. relations abroad, the Republican presidential candidates continue to embarrass themselves and the nation with their hateful and bigoted rhetoric that has made the world cringe.Luckily, President Obama is still in charge until next January and still light enough on his feet to dance the tango and school conservatives at the same time.
