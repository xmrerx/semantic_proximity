toronto ( reuters ) - canadian designer line the label shot to prominence on monday after u.s. actress meghan markle wore a coat from the brand in her first public appearance after her engagement to britain s prince harry .
markle appeared in the sunken garden at kensington palace on monday in the late november chill , donning the c $ 799 ( $ 627.11 ) white wrap coat with oversized collars and cinched at the waist with a knotted belt .
the surge in interest in the coat caused the style to quickly sell out and crashed the toronto-based knitwear label s website in some parts of the world , including in london .
the company is taking reorders on the coat , an external spokeswoman said by email .
line has since named the coat meghan , company president and co-founder john muscat said in a statement , adding it was one of her favorite pieces from the fashion label .
we are incredibly honored that meghan chose to wear a line coat to mark this very special occasion , muscat said .
we are elated for meghan and wish her a lifetime of happiness with prince harry .
markle , who has a starring role in the toronto-filmed u.s. tv show suits , has lived in the canadian city for several years .
markle also wore a line coat to the closing ceremony of the invictus games in toronto in september , days after the pair made their first public appearance together .
celebrities including sandra bullock , jennifer garner and kate hudson have also been photographed wearing the brand .
line was founded in 2000 by muscat and designer jennifer wells .
it was acquired a few years later by canadian fashion house and importer pya , which is based in a north toronto suburb .
