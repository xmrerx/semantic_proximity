The Senate Republicans unveiled their disastrous health care bill on Thursday, and it was immediately shot down by everyone from Republicans to Democrats to former President Barack Obama.
Now, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has broken her silence to weigh in on the bill and the GOP is going to HATE it.On Friday, Clinton urged her supporters to speak out against the Obamacare replacement plan, encouraging them to choose people over politics.
As the Republicans health care plan will strip tens of millions of Americans of their life-saving health coverage, her message is surely an important one.Clinton took to Twitter to take her message public.
In solidarity with the words of former President Barack Obama, Clinton slammed the GOP bill: @BarackObama is right.
This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics.
Speak out against this bill.
The Senate Republicans have been creating this bill in absolute secrecy, and it s no wonder why.
This health care bill is a monstrosity and an assault on the lives of most Americans.
Thanks to the GOP s proposal, cuts would be made to Medicaid and federal funding for Planned Parenthood would be prohibited, which has made even conservatives voice their concerns.Yesterday, Obama called the Senate s pathetic attempt at replacing his health care bill a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.
He also said it was not a health care bill at all.
Clinton called the GOP out even more viciously by following up her first tweet with this: Forget death panels.
If Republicans pass this bill, they re the death party.
We could not have said that any better.
The GOP s health care bill proves that they don t give a sh*t about the lives of Americans, and this measure must be stopped in its tracks.Featured image via Bryan Thomas / Getty Images
