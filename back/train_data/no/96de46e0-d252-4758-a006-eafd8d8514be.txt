how many times have liberals used the argument that everyone s relatives came here illegally !
?
the answer is about a million or more times .
liberals can t seem to differentiate between people who came to our nation to either escape persecution or to find a better life that came through ellis island or immediately applied for citizenship in america , and those who float across the rio grande on an inner-tube after paying a coyote a fee to help them illegally cross our borders.this meme brilliantly explains the difference in 4 short bullet points .
: here s a little visual for anyone who tells you # 4 isn t true : it is estimated that 12.5 million illegal aliens are currently living in the united states.below , are a series of visuals from the federation for american immigration reform or fair to help americans to understand the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying americans .
this data from september 27 , 2017 , paints a pretty bleak economic picture for america if we continue to ignore the serious problem of illegal immigration : fair at the federal , state , and local levels , taxpayers shell out approximately $ 134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens , and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens .
that amounts to a tax burden of approximately $ 8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $ 115,894,597,664 .
the total cost of illegal immigration to u.s. taxpayers is both staggering and crippling .
in 2013 , fair estimated the total cost to be approximately $ 113 billion .
so , in under four years , the cost has risen nearly $ 3 billion .
this is a disturbing and unsustainable trend .
