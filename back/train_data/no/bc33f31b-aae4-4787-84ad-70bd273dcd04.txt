hey robert mueller !
do you care to find out which foreign leaders candidate hillary clinton spoke with during her campaign ?
because according to hillary , she received messages from foreign leaders asking her if they can endorse her to stop donald trump from becoming president .
i am already receiving messages from leaders .
i m having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop donald trump .
hillary clinton , march , 2016hmmm is there a tape of candidate donald trump like the one of hillary , where he admits to having discussions with foreign leaders about how to stop hillary from becoming president ? while speaking at a democratic presidential townhall meeting in columbus , ohio , in march of 2016 , hillary thought she was rather clever by attempting to make it appear as though donald trump was wildly unpopular with all of her foreign connections .
it s too bad the media forgot about this clip : treason ?
video surfaces of hillary admitting she was in contact with foreign leaders interfering in our election !
