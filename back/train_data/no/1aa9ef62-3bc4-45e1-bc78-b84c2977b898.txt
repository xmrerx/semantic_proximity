how bad is it in venezuela ?
people are eating one meal a day and the government is doing its best to cover up the humanitarian crisis .
we know about the toilet paper shortage but a food shortage is horrific .
the lines for pretty much everything have been very long .
there s a shortage of everything .
the bottom line is that socialism sucks !
