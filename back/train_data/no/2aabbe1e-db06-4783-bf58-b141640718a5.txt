i don t think there are too many people who would disagree with that sentiment , given obama s obvious desire to make americans believe islam has nothing to do with islamic terror .
in the wake of yet another attack on american soil by a radicalized muslin gunman , actor scott baio questioned whether president barack obama wants to eliminate the united states as it was created .
appearing on fox business , the former happy days star was asked if the president is reluctant to say islamic terror .
he s absolutely reluctant , baio replied .
i can t tell , lester , if he s dumb , he s a muslim or he s a muslim sympathizer .
and i don t think he s dumb .
watch here : baio , an ardent supporter of donald trump , was asked to explain obama s actions .
i have no idea , the actor replied .
like i said , either he s a sympathizer , a muslim sympathizer or he s a muslim to allow this to keep happening .
he insisted that trump is the only person who wants to do something about these attacks by islamic extremists.borrowing from obama s 2008 promise of fundamentally transforming the united states of america , baio speculated on what may be the end game for liberals like obama and hillary clinton .
is it to totally eliminate the united states as it was created and founded and the way it is now ?
he asked.the actor went on to say he is baffled by the inaction from obama and clinton , saying the only time they get angry is at republicans .
