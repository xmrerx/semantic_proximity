He made great points about the need for law and order over violence: From what I understand, any rumors that they ve been told to stand down will be squashed today.
They are not going to allow this disobedience, they are not going to allow the ski masks we ve been seeing around the country, so we still have a presence here at Berkeley today.
We don t want to do anything that is going to give us a public relations black eye.
We ve stayed within the framework of the law and I intend that protesters will continue to stay within the framework of the law I DIDN T SEE AN UPSIDE IN COMING TO BERKELY AND STANDING TOE TO TOE WITH TWINKLE TOES AND BUTTER CUPS
