baghdad ( reuters ) - iraq is opposed to the united states recognising jerusalem as israel s capital and moving its embassy there , prime minister haider al-abadi said on tuesday , warning that such a decision would negatively affect middle east stability .
u.s. president donald trump told palestinian president mahmoud abbas on tuesday that he intends to shift the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem , breaking with decades of u.s. policy that the city s status must be decided in negotiations with the palestinians .
the iraqi government received this news with the utmost worry and warns about this decision s ramifications on the stability of the region and the world , the iraqi cabinet said in a statement .
abadi and his government joined a mounting chorus of voices saying trump s move would unleash turmoil .
a senior u.s. official told reuters last week that trump was also likely to recognise jerusalem as israel s capital .
the european union , the palestinian authority , saudi arabia , turkey , and the arab league all warned that any such declaration would have repercussions across the middle east .
