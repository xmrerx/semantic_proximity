but that s another story make a sub-standard movie win sub-standard prizes.moving on to 2017 who has time to worry about slights against black actors or directors this year , it s trash trump time , and regardless of facts ( like uh the fact that obama and his dhs actually created the list of muslim majority countries who trump used in his temporary ban ) duvernay showed up wearing a dress she claims was made in a majority muslim country .
how very progressive a small sign of solidarity .
i chose to wear a gown by a designer from a majority muslim country .
thanks to @ ashistudio of lebanon .

we re just two moms with teenage daughters who want to see our girls grow up in a sharia-free zone .
so while you re out at the academy s pretending there s something glamorous about being a woman in a majority muslim nation , you might want to consider what you re promoting .
here s a few more photos of women s fashion in majority muslim nations just for fun : so next time you re going to wear a dress that represents muslim women from majority muslim nations , maybe you should remember the burka you don t want to be caught dead without one in yemen or something like that .
