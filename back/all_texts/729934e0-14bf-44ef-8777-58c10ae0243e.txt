At this point, it seems like Donald Trump cannot hold a rally without there being a protest.
Some of those protestors have a tendency to be beaten, and or forcefully removed from the event.
On Sunday, during a campaign rally in Muscatine, Iowa, a man wearing a red turban was forced to leave the venue.He was with a group of people protesting the event.
He was carrying a sign that said, Stop Hate.
That s a message completely antithetical to the values of Trump and his supporters.A video shows the crowd at the event was ecstatic about the man being forced to leave.
Hundreds of people can be heard cheering and shouting, U.S.A!
U.S.A.!
U.S.A!
It s a pretty good symbol for where America s racism is at.
That s when Trump says: He wasn t wearing one of those hats, was he?
Protesters escorted out of @realDonaldTrump rally "He wasn't wearing one of those hats was he?"

Apparently Trump was asking if the man was wearing a Make America Great Again hat that Trump supporters use to identify each other with.
It s the 21st century equivalent to the white hood the KKK wears.
In Trump s America you do not need to cover your face to be openly racist.It isn t hard to believe why people are protesting Trump.
Just last week he retweeted @whitegenocideTM, a Twitter account known for putting out images like one that shows Donald Trump pulling the lever on a gas chamber with Bernie Sanders inside.
Bernie Sanders being a Jewish man, who embodies everything that Trump and his supporters are against.
Values such as, equality, tolerance, and the idea that everyone deserves a chance to succeed.
Donald Trump has brought out the worst of the United States and exposed the Republican for what it is.
