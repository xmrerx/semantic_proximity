president donald trump s senior counselor kellyanne conway clarified a comment in which she mistakenly referred to a bowling green massacre .
she said friday on twitter that she meant to say terrorists instead of massacre , referencing a 2013 abc news story on two suspected terrorists living as refugees in kentucky.according to the story : the discovery in 2009 of two al qaeda-iraq terrorists living as refugees in bowling green , kentucky who later admitted in court that they d attacked u.s. soldiers in iraq prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones , known as ieds , for other suspected terrorists fingerprints .
an undercover fbi operation exposes al qaeda terrorists posing as refugees in the middle of the american heartland .
they quickly learned the laxed background checks were to blame .
but it turns out that may be just the beginning .
there may be dozens more now in this country as well.the video below shows an admitted al qaeda terrorist who had already killed american soldiers in iraq , trying to get weapons to kill more of them .
and authorities tell abc news he may be just one of dozens of men with american blood on their hands where mistakenly allowed to settle in the us as refugees.the two men came from iraq 4 years ago among tens of thousands of refugees who the state department approved to come here , seen as no threat to the us .
but the two were in fact , as the fbi says part of an al qaeda connected insurgent group that had already killed american soldiers with road side bombs .
