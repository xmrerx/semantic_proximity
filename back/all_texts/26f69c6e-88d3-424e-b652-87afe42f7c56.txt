Ted Cruz has made a staggering confession during an appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show, which confirms just how deep the hatred between Cruz and rival GOP primary candidate Donald Trump has become.
In a new low for the Republican race, Cruz confessed he d quite like to run Trump over with his car.On Wednesday night s show, Kemmel asked Cruz: Donald Trump is he the person you dislike the most, of anyone in America?
The Texas senator and nearest GOP rival to Donald Trump first adopted a folksy tone in response, saying: Oh, no, But then Kimmel pushed him with a marginally tougher question: Who do you like better, he asked, Obama or Trump?
This sent the audience into fits of laughter while Cruz took a long pause, seemingly struggling with his answer, finally answering somewhat less than diplomatically: I dislike Obama s policies more.
As Kimmel nodded and reassured the Republican with an I see, Cruz added: But Donald Donald is a unique individual, If I were in my car and getting ready to reverse, and saw Donald in the backup camera I m not confident which pedal I d push.
Just pause and let that sink in for a moment.
The two favorite Republican candidates for President of the United States, have now reduced their campaigns to sl*tshaming each others wives, and fantasies about doing each other physical damage.Between Cruz and Trump, there is almost zero breathing space in the Republican race to ventilate the real issues facing America over the next decade; issues that aren t going to magically vanish if one of them somehow manages to secure the Presidency.
So we face the very real potential of heading into a Presidential election with a Republican candidate (either Cruz OR Trump) who would rather devote campaign time to frat bro level antics, than statesmanship.
Just when we thought the GOP primary could sink any lower, it did.
