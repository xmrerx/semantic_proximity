manila ( reuters ) - philippine lawmakers on wednesday said they would hold more hearings before deciding whether to confirm the appointment of the country s environment minister , although some said they were likely to approve the step .
the confirmation of environment and natural resources secretary roy cimatu is being closely watched given the policy implications for the mining sector in the world s top nickel ore supplier .
cimatu , a former soldier , replaced staunch environmentalist regina lopez who was rejected by the same legislative panel in may after less than a year in office .
all ministerial appointments in the country go through a similar process .
during her term , lopez ordered the closure or suspension of 26 of the nation s 41 mines and banned open-pit mining , measures that cimatu has not reversed .
he has said his team was still reviewing the closure and suspension orders .
i am not pessimistic about his confirmation , but we need additional hearings , senator tito sotto , part of the 25-member commission on appointments , told reporters .
apart from sotto , two other senators , juan miguel zubiri and gregorio honasan , also expressed support for cimatu .
this is a proud moment for me , honasan , also a former soldier , said at the hearing .
i can vouch for his competence and integrity .
the next hearing is set for sept. 27 .
mining is a contentious issue in largely underexplored philippines following past examples of environmental mismanagement .
in 1996 , a tailings leak at canadian-owned marcopper mining corp s copper mine in marinduque contaminated rivers .
the sector contributes less than 1 percent to the economy , with only 3 percent of the 9 million hectares identified by the state as having high mineral reserves being mined , according to government data .
