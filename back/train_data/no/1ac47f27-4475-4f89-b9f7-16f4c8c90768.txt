khartoum ( reuters ) - sudan expects the united states to lift economic sanctions as khartoum has met all the required conditions , a sudanese minister said on wednesday , days before washington is due to announce a decision .
the u.s. government has said it is deciding whether to lift a raft of penalties imposed first over khartoum s perceived support of global terrorism , later its violent suppression of rebels in darfur .
former u.s. president barack obama temporarily eased some of the sanctions that have effectively cut khartoum off from large parts of the global financial system .
officials said the gesture was meant to recognize khartoum s moves to end conflicts and its help in the war on terrorism .
in july , u.s. president donald trump s administration postponed for three months a decision on whether to remove the restrictions full-time - giving it an oct. 12 deadline to make up its mind .
sudan has fulfilled all the necessary conditions relating to the roadmap and the u.s. administration is a witness to that and therefore we expect the sanctions to be lifted , sudan s state minister for foreign affairs , hamed momtaz , told reuters .
washington has said sudan needs to resolve its internal conflicts and let more aid into darfur and other rebellious border areas , among other conditions .
some rights groups have raised concerns , saying the lifting of sanctions could lead to further abuses .
we re afraid lifting the sanctions could pave way for the government to ... violate rights , said al-buraq al-nazir al-warraq , the executive manager of the sudanese observatory for human rights , a group suspended by the government .
any lifting of economic penalties would be a major turnaround for the government of president omar hassan al-bashir , who once played host to osama bin laden and is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of orchestrating genocide in darfur .
