new york ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump said on monday he believed we really have a chance to make peace between israel and the palestinians .
trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough , not least because his administration has yet to articulate a strategy for restarting a moribund peace process .
trump has described peace between israelis and palestinians as the ultimate deal .
peace between the palestinians and israel would be a fantastic achievement , and we are giving it an absolute go .
i think there s a good chance that it could happen .
most people would say there s no chance whatsoever , trump said as he began a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in new york ahead of the u.n. general assembly s meeting .
i think israel would like to see it .
i think the palestinians would like to see it .
i can tell you the trump administration would like to see it .
so we re working very hard on it ; we ll see what happens .
historically , people say it can t happen .
i say it can happen .
trump is also to meet palestinian president mahmoud abbas later this week .
