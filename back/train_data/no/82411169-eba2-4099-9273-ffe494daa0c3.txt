it s becoming fairly commonplace for public acts of violence to occur when liberals don t get exactly what they want .
we used to rely on free speech at town halls to debate our differences , but we re living in a post-obama era now , where soros paid thugs have been committing so many acts of violence occur that we almost expect it .
sadly , wherever there is a gathering of people with opposing political views , most americans now expect to see violence take place a man got physical with republican north dakota rep. kevin cramer at a town hall meeting thursday before being escorted out by police.the man was yelling at rep. cramer , will the rich benefit from , if the health care is destroyed , do the rich get a tax break ?
yes or no ?
he then shoved cash into the congressman s collar , saying , there you go , take it .
cramer responded , that s too far , and police escorted the man from the meeting .
another man was escorted out after he stepped in and blocked the man yelling as he was angrily approaching the congressman.cnn anchor poppy harlow described the scene as , this man showing his disgust with the congressman s support of tax cuts for the wealthy , one part of the gop plan right now .
