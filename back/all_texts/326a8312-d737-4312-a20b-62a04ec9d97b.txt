It was only a matter of time before this happened.
The very first instance of an American presidential candidate in the modern age dropping the f-bomb during a stump speech occurred this week.
And, naturally, it was Donald Trump who broke through the taboo then backed over it just to make sure it s dead.Indeed, Trump let fly with the f-word on Friday during one of his stream-of-consciousness rants that pass for stump speeches.
And, frankly, I don t know whether to scowl or cheer.
In spite of Trump s general awfulness, I m leaning cheer.
We re gonna bring businesses back.
We re gonna have businesses that used to be in New Hampshire, that are now in Mexico, come back to New Hampshire, and you can tell them to go f*ck themselves!
Because they let you down, and they left!
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr-_Nwi2FyY&w=560&h=315]Yes, let s tell corporations that send jobs to places like Mexico and China to go f*ck themselves.
You know, corporations like Trump s.There s something particularly exciting when f*ck becomes demystified.
It should be.
It s just a word.
We can t say it on non-pay cable or on the radio or on websites because advertisers don t like it but we can show unspeakable scenes of violence and other horrors all the time.
There s something perverse and unjust about that.
So, in that regard, Trump can feel free to let the expletives fly.
But if he s elected, I wonder if his FCC appointees will be equally lenient.
On the other hand, Trump s use of f*ck is another step away from presidential decorum on the Republican side, and one step closer to amateur-hour composed of reality show hacks running for the highest office in the land.
I m honestly torn.For the record, Trump has said f*ck in public before, but not during a presidential stump speech.Featured image via video screen grab.
