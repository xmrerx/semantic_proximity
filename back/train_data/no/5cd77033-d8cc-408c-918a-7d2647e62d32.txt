washington ( reuters ) - the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday sharply questioned u.s. plans to sell f-16 fighter jets to pakistan , questioning pakistani actions he described as threatening u.s. troops as they try to stabilize afghanistan .
“ they continue to support the taliban , the haqqani network and give safe haven to al qaeda , ” republican senator bob corker said to secretary of state john kerry , who was testifying to the committee about the state department ’ s annual budget request .
the u.s. government said on feb. 12 it had approved the sale to pakistan of up to eight f-16 fighter jets built by lockheed martin corp , radar and other equipment in a deal valued at $ 699 million .
lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale and corker has made clear he has doubts about it .
kerry responded that the issue is complicated and said pakistan also has been an ally .
“ i understand your reservations about it but their military has been deeply engaged in the fight against terrorism , ” he said .
