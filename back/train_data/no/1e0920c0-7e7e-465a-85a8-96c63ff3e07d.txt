when cnn , who is owned by multi-billion dollar corporation time-warner threatened to out a private individual for doctoring a wrestling video of donald trump and replacing his face with a cnn logo , most americans were stunned. # veryfakenewscnn is likely going to rue the day they threatened a reddit user that they would expose his identity to leftist thugs , as punishment for doctoring a video to make it look like cnn was being body-slammed by donald trump.my totally not forced apology to the great and truthy @ cnn .

assange cited the violation : 135.60 of the new york criminal code .
memes are showing up all over the place on social media mocking cnn s threat .
even worse , in some cases , the memes are resurrecting news stories that cnn would rather not see repeated on social media , like the the story about former cnn guest host kathy griffin s not-funny photos of herself holding an isis inspired , decapitated , bloody head of president donald trump .
cnn fired kathy griffin , but not before they defended her on their network , which quickly earned them the trending hashtag # cnnisisis on twitter.earlier today , we reported on a video that has just been released where cnn s logo is replacing the head of president trump who s being assassinated in a central park julius caesar play.lol !
new video emerges of central park trump assassination play with cnn logo covering trump s head [ video ]
