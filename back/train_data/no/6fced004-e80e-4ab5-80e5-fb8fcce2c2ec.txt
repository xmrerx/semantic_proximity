johannesburg ( reuters ) - south african deputy president cyril ramaphosa , a leading contender to become head of the ruling anc in december , has named science and technology minister naledi pandor as his running mate , local media reported on sunday .
the race to replace president jacob zuma at the helm of the african national congress is heating up amid mounting allegations of graft against zuma , who consistently denies wrongdoing .
his successor will be the anc s presidential candidate in 2019 , when zuma will step down as head of state .
ramaphosa has been under pressure to pick a female running mate as gender equality is a key anc policy goal and his main challenger is nkosazana dlamini-zuma , a veteran politician , former african union head and zuma s ex-wife .
eyewitness news and the mail & guardian newspaper reported on their websites that ramaphosa made the announcement that pandor would be the anc deputy presidential candidate on his ticket during a rally in the northern province of limpopo .
it s a smart move .
pandor s smart and she does not appear tainted by any corruption allegation nor is she close to either the zuma or ramaphosa camps .
and as a woman , she ticks a number of boxes that make a lot of sense , said gary van staden , a political analyst with nkc african economics .
pandor is an articulate technocrat with a professorial manner who has also done a stint as education minister .
her spokesman could not immediately confirm the reports and said pandor was traveling to jordan for a science conference .
ramaphosa s camp could not immediately be reached for comment .
