somehow we don t think this is what the queen of the clinton crime syndicate expected at this stage of her campaign the latest q-poll numbers have dropped and there aren t really a lot of surprises in the top lines .
( well there are a couple of exceptions but we ll get to those in a minute . )
what was really startling , though , was the results of the open ended questions about several of the candidates .
most specifically , the massively leading , top of the list responses for hillary clinton have to be giving her team nightmares .
( connecticut post emphasis added ) clinton leads the democratic field with 45 percent , down from 55 percent july 30 , with u.s. sen. bernie sanders of vermont at 22 percent and biden at 18 percent .
no other candidate tops 1 percent with 11 percent undecided .
this is sanders highest tally and closest margin.clinton tops the democrats no way list with 11 percent .
liar is the first word that comes to mind more than others in an open-ended question when voters think of clinton .
arrogant is the word for trump and voters say bush when they think of bush .
here s the high end of the list.holy cow .
you get 394 responses just by combining the top three results of liar , dishonest and untrustworthy .
you pretty much have to add up all of the other words on the list to catch up with those three .
and this isn t just a list of responses by republicans that s everyone .
what s truly amazing is that this is clearly the prevailing american perception at this point and yet , clinton is still the democrat frontrunner .
i m not sure if that says more about her or the party .
