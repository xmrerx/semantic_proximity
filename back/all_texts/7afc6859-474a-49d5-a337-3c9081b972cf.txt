As exit polls roll in for the latest batch of states to vote in this election cycle s hotly contested primaries, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton turns her attentions to Donald Trump.
Ever the unrepentant sexist, Trump recently accused Clinton of playing the woman card to get votes away from Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders.
In her speech this evening as the latest primary votes roll in, the former Secretary of State addressed Trump s uncalled for comments.
Clinton said: Now, the other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the, quote, woman card.
Well, if fighting for women s healthcare and paid family leave and equal is playing the woman card, then DEAL ME IN!
Secretary Clinton is right, of course.
GOP sexists like Trump like to try and make people believe that women are equal citizens in this country.
We are not; in fact, far from it.
There is most definitely a war on women s reproductive health rights, the GOP refuses to pass equal pay laws, and sexism is rampant all over the place including in this very presidential primary.
People who accuse folks of playing the woman card or the gay card or the black card are simply bigots who don t understand the existence of systemic inequality.This response was right on the money, Secretary Clinton.
Thank for letting that sexist imbecile Trump have it.Watch the video of her brilliant response below:Featured image via Eric Thayer/Getty Images
