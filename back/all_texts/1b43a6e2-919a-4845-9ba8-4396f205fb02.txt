Reports from several sources revealed on November 22 that Clinton campaign chief John Podesta was taking meetings with a group claiming it had discovered irregularities in several counties of some of the states that Trump won.Apparently a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers met with Podesta to express their belief that they found persuasive evidence that results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked, according to New York magazine.In order to overturn the election, these challenges would have to succeed in multiple counties and multiple states all at the same time to swing the Electoral College to Clinton, so it certainly seems like a desperate long shot.It is such a long shot that even the left s favorite numbers guru, Nate Silver, essentially dismissed the effort.To follow: some *very* quick analysis which suggests the claim here of rigged results in Wisconsin is probably BS: https://t.co/SYlE76bnmQ Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 23, 2016
