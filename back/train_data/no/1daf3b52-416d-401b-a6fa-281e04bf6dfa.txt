jeffrey toobin chimes in to protect hillary clinton and it is in very poor taste but mostly untrue .
the reason mr. toobin s claim is untrue is that amb .
stevens asked for more security 600 times !
he knew the dangers but was not putting anyone at risk it was the state department that failed him by not adding more security ! during one of the breaks in hillary clinton s testimony on benghazi , jeffrey toobin insinuated that ambassador chris stevens purposely put himself in harm s way.stevens travelled to benghazi from tripoli on september 10 , 2012 and planned to stay until september 14 , 2012 .
stevens only had two diplomatic security personnel with him.committee member rep. lynn westmoreland ( r-ga. ) said that stevens had asked clinton and her state department multiple times for extra protection .
clinton said that stevens did not have her personal email account but had the means to call or email any relevant person at the state department .
he had the email and he had the direct line of everybody that he worked with for years .
he had been posted with officials in the state department .
they had gone through difficult , challenging , dangerous assignments together .
he was in constant contact with people .
yes , he and the people working for him asked for more security .
some of those requests were approved , others were not , clinton said.toobin said to cnn s wolf blitzer that stevens purposely put himself and the security team in dangerous situation .
yes , mr. toobin , blaming the victim is in very poor taste :
