I will continue my service through August Sean Spicer (@PressSec) July 21, 2017It was speculated that it was a blow when the Trump administration announced yesterday that Anthony Scaramucci had joined the Trump administration as White House Communications Director.A few things Scaramucci move is also a blow to Spicer, who has sought to have comms director report to him, as Dubke did.
No chance here Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) July 21, 2017NYDN reported: Spicer, who will stay on through August, told the President he vehemently disagreed with his choice for the top communications post, and his distaste was evident when reporters approached him about the appointment.ABC News White House Correspondent Johnathan Karl said the former press secretary slammed the door in my face when he questioned him on Scaramucci, chalking it up to strange times.
The press is using this move as a sign that the Trump administration is collapsing and in chaos:Chris Wallace: There is a Game of Thrones quality to this @WhiteHouse; you do have various power centers that are colliding w/ each other.
