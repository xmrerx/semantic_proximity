mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico s newest political force formally emerged on friday when a right-left coalition presented its official request with the electoral institute to compete in next year s presidential election .
the coalition , known as for mexico in front , brings together the conservative national action party ( pan ) , the center-left party of the democratic revolution ( prd ) and the citizens movement party .
the coalition will compete against the ruling institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) , and leftist frontrunner andres manuel lopez obrador , of the national regeneration movement ( morena ) , in next july s vote .
president enrique pena nieto is constitutionally barred from running again .
with the formalizing of the coalition , the contours of the election are beginning to take shape .
nonetheless , it remains to be seen who for mexico in front will pick as its candidate .
pan president ricardo anaya is seen as the most likely figure , although mexico city s prd mayor miguel angel mancera is also seen as a contender .
former mexican first lady margarita zavala broke with the pan in october in order to run as an independent .
last week , finance minister jose antonio meade resigned to seek the presidential nomination of the pri , which has broken with tradition by seeking outside help to clean up its tarnished image and stay in office for another six years .
the pri faces an uphill battle to reclaim the presidency , and is banking on meade , who is not a pri member and has a reputation for honesty , to win over voters tired by years of graft , violence and lackluster growth .
