former speaker newt gingrich discusses the russia investigation with hannity he drops a bomb when he says that obama should testify under oath before congress in the russia probe .
we totally agree ! https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=fc_t7iofonunewt gingrich : there s no question that congress should call the former president in to testify under oath to explain what he was doing and why he was doing it , gingrich said .
there s no question that they should build the case from the ground up.who was doing the investigating ?
who was reporting to the president ?
who did it go through ?
what were the meetings like when they decided not to pursue it ?
i mean , talk about an extraordinary failure of national security .
guess what s about to happen , the congress is about to have to call barack obama in to testify under oath about when he knew about russia meddling .
who told him ?
why did he do nothing ?
who was in the meetings when he decided to do nothing ?
it s going to turn out , yes , there s a big russian story .
it s barack obama , not donald trump .
and you can not make this stuff up .
