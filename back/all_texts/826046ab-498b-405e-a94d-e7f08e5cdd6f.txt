Recently, at one of his thank you rallies, Donald Trump admitted that his supporters yeah, those people who were regularly in the news for beating African-Americans at rallies, attacking minorities (often finding themselves praised by The Donald), and generally proving that Hillary Clinton was being generous when she said only half of them are deplorables are violent and crazy.
While the mainstream media portrays these people as what did they say?
Oh, yes, economically anxious rather than racist, violent, deplorable, xenophobic, or any of the bazillion terms that can properly be applied to such individuals, the rest of us had no problem telling it like it is.
Even Trump, who regularly blasted anyone who insulted his precious little snowflakes, now seems willing to admit that they are awful people.
He s just OK with it (until anyone who isn t him calls them what they are, of course).Following the obvious response to The Donald applying terms to his followers that previously were verboten in his eyes, Trump tweeted perhaps the stupidest thing he has tweeted in a while (and that s saying a lot) on Sunday.
If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2016Trump, of course, seems to be referencing attempts to call him out on his cozy relationship with Russia, whose leader directly commanded an effort to hack Trump s political opponents to help the billionaire secure the presidency.
Maybe he meant the peaceful marches in the streets that followed his historic victory (historic in the sense that no one elected President has lost the popular vote by as much as Trump).
In any case, he seems to feel that the many crimes committed in his name like when two men Trump later called passionate individuals who love this country beat a Hispanic homeless man with a pipe and urinated on him pale in comparison to the ongoing effort to expose him as a real-life Manchurian candidate (don t call those men names, though.
Wouldn t want to hurt their feelings).
Naturally, Twitter jumped on this latest opportunity to curb-stomp President-elect P*ssygrabber:Please @realDonaldTrump, for your own sake, stop with this nonsense.
You're demonstrably wrong and the proof is in the numerous hate crimes.
David G. McAfee (@DavidGMcAfee) December 18, 2016@realDonaldTrump Like the ones that spray paint swastikas in the honor of your name?
Or the ones that want Americans of different color out of "your" country Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) December 18, 2016This is a twisted joke, because Trump is well aware how violent and racist his supporters are.
