tripoli ( reuters ) - libya s coastguard intercepted 299 migrants from sub-saharan african countries on two rubber boats east of tripoli on tuesday , officials said .
the migrants were intercepted near the town of zliten by one of several coastguard vessels that italy repaired and delivered to libya earlier this year .
libya s western shoreline is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach europe by boat , many of them fleeing conflict or poverty .
crossings have dropped sharply since july , when an armed group in the smuggling hub of sabratha began blocking departures .
under pressure from italy and other european states , libya s coastguard has also become increasingly active , patrolling more widely and intercepting migrants before they can reach international rescue vessels .
as of oct. 24 , more than 18,800 migrants had been intercepted so far this year , according to the international organisation for migration .
more than 111,000 had crossed to italy , the vast majority from libya .
the group picked up on tuesday was brought back to tripoli port and was being transferred to a detention center in tajoura , a suburb of the capital .
it included about 15 children and 25 women , said coastguard official ali al-shebrak .
a reporter saw one newborn child crying from hunger as his mother , barely able to walk , was given medical treatment from an ambulance .
