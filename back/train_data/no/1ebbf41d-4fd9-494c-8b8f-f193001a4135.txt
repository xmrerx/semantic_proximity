rep. debbie wasserman schultz dropped a big bomb during an interview on cnn today .
she claimed that jeh johnson s testimony about the dnc computer hack is wrong in every respect and utterly misinformed .
whoa !
who s telling the truth ? schultz told the cnn anchor he s wrong in every respect .
let me be very clear .
at no point during my tenure at the dnc was i contacted by the fbi , dhs , or any government agency , or alerted or made aware that they believed that the russians , an enemy state , was intruding on our network .
in case you missed it , former dhs director jeh johnson testified to lawmakers this week that the dnc rejected his agency s offer to protect its network despite receiving warnings about a computer hack .
instead , the dnc chose an outside cyber security firm to help solve the computer hacks that led to wikileaks publishing thousands of its emails.cnn s bolduan asked schultz how both accounts could be true : secretary johnson says dnc rebuffed the help offered .
you are saying no one contacted you ?
schultz replied with a shocking statement : secretary johnson is utterly misinformed .
that is simply not accurate .
schultz went further and blamed the fbi for not helping : they left the russians on our network for more than for almost a year before we discovered that they were there .
