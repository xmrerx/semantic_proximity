helsinki ( reuters ) - joining nato would improve finland s security but is unlikely to happen any time soon because of a lack of wider support , finance minister petteri orpo said on wednesday .
his national coalition party , part of a three-party ruling coalition , had a clear position that nato membership would strengthen finland s security , and finland should be part of all western institutions , orpo told reuters .
finland is one of six members of the european union that have not also joined the western military alliance .
it has forged closer ties with nato in recent years over heightened security concerns in the baltic sea region , but has stayed out of the alliance in line with a tradition of avoiding confrontation with russia , with which it shares an 833-mile ( 1,340 km ) border and a difficult history .
this government will not seek membership , and we are committed to that ...
when the next government will be formed , this issue will likely be considered again , taking into account the situation in the country and the security environment .
a poll released by the defence ministry on tuesday showed only 22 percent of finns support nato membership while 62 percent opposed it .
because a large majority of parliamentary parties , as well as of the citizens , do not support seeking a membership , the issue is not that topical .
orpo s ncp ( national coalition party ) leads opinion polls with support of around 21 percent .
the next general elections will be held in 2019 .
president sauli niinisto said last month that any move to join nato would need public approval via a referendum .
