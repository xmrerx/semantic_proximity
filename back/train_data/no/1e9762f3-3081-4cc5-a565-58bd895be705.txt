istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish authorities issued detention warrants on monday for 106 people believed to have worked as matchmakers for a network accused of orchestrating last year s failed military coup , a spokesman for the istanbul police said .
sixty-two of the suspects had been detained in the operation centered in istanbul and spread over 20 other provinces , he said .
operations to locate the rest were ongoing .
the suspects were marriage officials for supporters of the u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , who the turkish government says was behind the failed july 2016 coup , the spokesman said .
gulen denies any involvement in the coup attempt .
they were believed to have helped set up arranged marriages for some of gulen s followers , he said .
turkish officials say the gulen network closely monitored the personal and professional lives of some supporters , including their education , careers and marriages .
turkish police and state intelligence officials identified the suspects in a joint operation using conversations traced on bylock , an encrypted messaging application commonly used by gulen s supporters , the spokesman said .
turkey has identified 215,092 users of bylock and has launched investigations into 23,171 of them , the interior minister said last month .
more than 50,000 people , including security officials , military personnel and civil servants , have been detained in the aftermath of the coup .
the crackdown has alarmed turkey s western allies and rights groups , who say president tayyip erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent .
the government says the measures , taken under emergency rule that was imposed after the coup , are necessary due to the security threats turkey faces .
