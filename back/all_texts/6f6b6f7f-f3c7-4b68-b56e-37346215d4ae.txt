WE LOVE THIS LADY!
She gets what s really happening.
She calls out the media and the left on hijacking the narrative on Charlottesville: I Don t Care About Charlottesville, the KKK, or White Supremacy White supremacy and the KKK.
Really?
That s what you guys want me to be concerned about this week?
I mean there are around 6,000 klansmen left in our nation.
You want me to seriously process that every day when I wake up?
Why did we not hear a single thing about David Duke, white supremacy and the KKK the entire time Obama was in office?
Do you think they were all hiding underground waiting for the next white president?
Meeting by the light of the moon?
Do you really actually mean they weren t still meeting, holding protests and having rallies?
Maybe the media wasn t covering it.
Use your brain.
I mean the media is actually fabricating a reality tonight Honestly everybody involved in this fake racial war is a loser.
