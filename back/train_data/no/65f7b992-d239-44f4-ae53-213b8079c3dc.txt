washington ( reuters ) - computer security records turned over to the fbi from an email server hillary clinton used while she was u.s. secretary of state show no evidence of foreign hacking , the new york times reported on thursday , citing unnamed people close to a federal investigation into her emails .
the security logs handed over by a former aide to clinton , the democratic front-runner in the nov. 8 presidential election , back up her stance that her use of a personal email account did not risk exposing u.s. secrets to hackers or foreign governments , the times said .
