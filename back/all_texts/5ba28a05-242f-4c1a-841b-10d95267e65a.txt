Former NBC anchor Matt Lauer claims he s planning on doing some soul searching now that he s got time on his hands after being fired for sexual misconduct .
He might want to take a look at the old footage of him awkwardly interviewing Sandra Bullock about a nude scene Yikes!
Is it his tone of voice or just overall creepiness during the interview?
You be the judge Lauer begins the 2009 interview about Bullock s film The Proposal by telling her how long it s been since he last interviewed her on the Today Show.He then adds with a smile: The major thing that s changed since I ve seen you last?
I have now seen you naked.
Bullock cringes and replies: And I m so sorry about that.
Were you able to sleep afterwards?
Lauer then says creepily: It s now my screensaver, before continuing to push the issue by saying: You were naked for most of this movie.
Bullock laughs awkwardly and insists: No, I m not.
I m not naked for most of this movie, [perhaps] emotionally naked.
Lauer continues to question Bullock about how she, playing a publishing house executive, covers her body with a wash cloth during the scene in which she bumps into her assistant played by Ryan Reynolds after a shower.Later in the interview he brings up her nudity again, asking: Did I mention you have a nude scene in this movie?
Pretty much from the time you opened your mouth, Bullock snaps.Lauer then tries to end the interview by saying: Sandra Bullock, come back more often but she replies no, not after this interview, no.
