Breitbart News, the right wing hate site that has been a huge booster of Donald Trump s campaign suffered a setback this week as major advertiser Kellogg s announced that they would no longer give their ad dollars to them.Kellogg s explained itself in a press release to Bloomberg: We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as a company.
We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com.
We are working to remove our ads from that site.
Breitbart is also connected to Trump through incoming White House counselor Steve Bannon, who served as the site s CEO.
Bannon described Breitbart as the platform for the alt-right, using the public relations term for white nationalist anti-immigrant beliefs.Several Democratic senators and members of congress have expressed concerns about Bannon s ties to the site and the white nationalist message it promotes, arguing that these beliefs should not get the blessing of a senior member of White House staff on the public payroll.Over the years, Breitbart has pushed racist and Islamophobic content in order to further its right wing agenda.
Founded by conservative activist Andrew Breitbart (who died of a heart attack), Breitbart has gleefully spread and popularized hateful content pandering to a conservative audience.In addition to the previously mentioned content, Breitbart has also embraced content attacking women s rights and has mocked gay rights.
Several Breitbart writers and contributors are notorious for spreading hate, a stance which has not prevented Republican election officials from contributing op-eds to the site and appearing as interview subjects.Kellogg s is not the first advertiser to drop Breitbart for its hate ties, as other companies have severed their relationships rather than be connected to the content coming out of the gutter.Featured image via YouTube
