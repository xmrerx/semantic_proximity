The ultimate guide to who really is the worst candidate in this election.On a night when the Chicago Cubs won their first World Series title since 1908, Seth Meyers Closer Look segment went largely unnoticed at a time when millions of Americans are trying to make their final decision on who they will vote for on November 8th.For months, these undecided voters have written off the contest as one between two equally awful candidates.
They say it doesn t matter who wins because both are the same.But as Meyers hilariously pointed out on Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton is not nearly as bad as Donald Trump.
It s not even close.
I mean, do you pick someone who s under federal investigation for using a private email server?
Or do you pick someone who called Mexicans rapists, claimed the president was born in Kenya, proposed banning an entire religion from entering the U.S., mocked a disabled reporter, said John McCain wasn t a war hero because he was captured, attacked the parents of a fallen soldier, bragged about committing sexual assault, was accused by 12 women of committing sexual assault, said some of those women weren t attractive enough for him to sexually assault, said more countries should get nukes, said he would force the military to commit war crimes, said a judge was biased because his parents were Mexicans, said women should be punished for having abortions, incited violence at his rallies, called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, called for his opponent to be jailed, declared bankruptcy six times, bragged about not paying income taxes, stiffed his contractors and employees, lost a billion dollars in one year, scammed customers at his fake university, bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself with money from his fake foundation, has a trial for fraud coming up in November, insulted an opponent s looks, insulted an opponent s wife s looks, and bragged about grabbing women by the pussy.
How do you choose?
Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, if people can t recognize that Trump is the worst candidate running in this election they shouldn t be allowed to vote at all.
The ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all.
