what a shocker !
a cnn panel rips on tom perez for his profanity laden speeches they turn it on trump but it s really interesting that they even questioned this so-called strategy : just in case you haven t heard perez speak : dnc chair tom perez was on msnbc ( video below ) to answer to critics who didn t like his nasty speech last week.he appeared at an event held by new jersey working families alliance , a re-branded acorn agency and gave a hateful and divisive speech .
he claimed that , republicans don t give a sh * t about people .
why the democrats picked this far left radical is puzzling unless the democrats plan on going full commie perez is connected to the radical open borders group la raza .
something tells us that obama made this pick for the democrats .
check out a defiant perez doubling down on is nastiness : our previous report and video below : perez has a long radical history connected to la raza and other open borders organizations .
his track record is full on radical .
e s in cahoots with obama to continue the fundamental transformation of america .
anyone who s a democrat should be shocked that he s taking the party in such a far left direction .
do your research and you ll know why he was the choice for dem chair.he just fired all democrat party staffers and is bringing in all new people .
the party is clearly taking a new direction and it s not a good one for any american .
donald trump didn t win watch entire video : republicans don t give a sh * t about people
