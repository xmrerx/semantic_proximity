DUBLIN (Reuters) - The continuing failure of Irish nationalists and pro-British Unionists to form a government in Northern Ireland is deeply concerning, Ireland s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said after Britain moved to directly set a budget for the region.
Britain s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire on Wednesday said he had no choice but to begin the process of setting a budget directly for the first time in a decade due to the failure of talks to form a devolved executive.
[L8N1N73RN] Both Governments share the view that it is regrettable and deeply concerning that, eight months after the last Assembly election, a power-sharing Executive is not in place, Coveney said in a statement.
The non-functioning of the devolved institutions is not something which the Irish Government wants to contemplate.
