By now we ve all heard about or seen the cast of Will & Grace get back together to make sure everyone votes for Hillary Clinton in a reboot of the hit show titled Vote Honey.
Well, they re back at it again.According to NewNowNext: Eric McCormack, Megan Mullally, Debra Messing and Sean Hayes reunited for the event which took place at the home of Michael Lombardo and Sonny Ward and featured the former co-stars singing a musical number about their love for Clinton and how Donald Trump is the worst.
The group did a remake of Officer Krupke from West Side Story written by the amazing Randy Rainbow.Here are a few tweets from Debra Messing showing the old gang back together:Our Album cover @EricMcCormack @SeanHayes @MeganOMullally #Hillary #we'reAllin #LAreunion pic.twitter.com/hbQW1UVSFJ Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) October 28, 2016My sista @MeganOMullally and I right before we sang a campaign parody to "Officer Krupke" written by the divine @Randyrainbow ???

And: The trouble is he s racist (wrong) The trouble is he s unfair (wrong) The trouble is he s tasteless (wrong) The trouble is his hair (wrong) We don t know how he got here Can t wait til he is gone Hope he doesn t sue us for this song Ending with: Hillary Clinton, we re with you!
The entire performance is beyond amazing, and definitely hilarious.Watch the hilarity go down here:Featured image via Twitter
