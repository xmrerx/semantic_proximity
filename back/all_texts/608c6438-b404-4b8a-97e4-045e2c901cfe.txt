Rocker Ted Nugent says he s seen the light after the Virgina shooting and claims he will stop with the toxic rhetoric he is famous for using to attack Democrats.In an interview with 77WABC Radio on Thursday, Nugent claimed that he has turned over a new leaf and reevaluated his language.
He swore he will from now on refrain from saying anything that can be interpreted as condoning or referencing violence.
At the tender age of 69, my wife has convinced me I just can t use those harsh terms.
I cannot and will not and I encourage even my friends/enemies on the left, in the Democrat and liberal world, that we have got to be civil to each other.
Ted is famous for attacking Democrats with violent suggestions that could be thought of as threats.
He has been particularly harsh on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
He once suggested that the former president suck on my machine gun and referred to him as a piece of shit.
He also disgustingly suggested that Obama should be lynched.
He was very horrendous towards Hillary Clinton, especially when she was running for president.
When making references to his guns he suggested she ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless b*tch.
Well, Ted, let s hope you are serious about changing your violent tune.
