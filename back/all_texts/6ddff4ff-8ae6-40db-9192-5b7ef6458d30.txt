BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A Russian official expressed interest in Argentina providing more food products to Russia, Argentina s foreign ministry said in a statement hours after the United States imposed steep anti-subsidy duties on Argentine biodiesel, a key export.
Argentina s Secretary of International Economic Affairs Horacio Reyser met with Sergey Dankvert, head of Russian agriculture watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor, earlier on Thursday.
