WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said on Monday that it may take weeks before many residents are able to return to the Florida Keys, following possible damage to bridges caused by Hurricane Irma.
The Keys are going to take a while, Bossert told a regular White House briefing, adding: I would expect that the Keys are not fit for re-entry for regular citizenry for weeks.
