He s absent from this.
The reason there s a special counsel is because he had to recuse himself from everything.
And I just, my own personal opinion, I think it s time for the attorney general to go.
Because you need leadership there, some deep systemic problems there.
Chaffetz also cited the DOJ not turning over documents on the Fast & Furious program and Sessions refusal to prosecute Clinton tech aide Bryan Pagliano for defying a Congressional subpoena.
