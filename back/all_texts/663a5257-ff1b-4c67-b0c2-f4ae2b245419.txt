If there s anyone who can appreciate a good Donald Trump impersonation it s Jimmy Fallon of The Tonight Show.
Fallon has been impersonating Trump throughout the entirety of this presidential election, and doing so pretty damn flawlessly.However, there s another Trump impersonator who is giving Fallon a run for his money, Jack Aiello, and he just nailed Trump perfectly during his 8th grade commencement ceremony.For comparison, here s Aiello doing his amazing Trump impression:Aiello did such a good job with his impersonation that it garnered the attention of Fallon, who then brought him onto The Tonight Show to play Little Donald, who now will be Trump s running-mate.
Fallon, as Trump, said on the show: The only person good enough to be my vice president is me.
Which is probably a very accurate guess as to who the real Donald Trump would actually like as his running-mate.Although, what the audience wasn t expecting, alongside the Aiello s brilliant Trump impression, was an equally as impressive, if not better impression, of Bernie Sanders, finger wave and all.
And, of course, Hillary Clinton was thrown into the sketch for good measure as well with Aiello and Fallon having the candidates prank calling each other.Needless to say, this kid has a bright future in impersonating, and SNL may be calling him sooner rather than later.Watch the hilarious sketch here:Featured image via video screen capture
