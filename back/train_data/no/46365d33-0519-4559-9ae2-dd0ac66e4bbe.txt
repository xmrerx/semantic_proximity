beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian government welcomes the formation of a committee that will discuss the current constitution and is expected to be formed at a congress to be convened by russia in sochi , syrian state media said .
the congress marks a russian effort to advance a political solution towards ending syria s six-year-long war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since world war two .
u.n.-backed talks towards ending the conflict are due to resume in geneva this week with the participation of the syrian opposition to president bashar al-assad , who is militarily dominant in the conflict thanks to russia and iran .
a pro-damascus newspaper , al-watan , reported on monday that the government delegation had postponed its travel to geneva , saying damascus was annoyed by the opposition s insistence on its demand that assad leave power at the start of a transition .
in a statement from the syrian foreign ministry , the syrian government said it would attend the national dialogue congress at the sochi talks , whose date has yet to be confirmed .
syria welcomed u.n. participation in legislative elections to be held after the discussion of the constitution , state media cited a foreign ministry statement as saying .
russian president vladimir putin last week won the backing of turkey and iran - another ally of assad - last week to host the congress .
