UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The Iran nuclear deal should be changed to eliminate provisions removing restrictions on Tehran s atomic program over time or it should be canceled, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.
Change it, or cancel it.
Fix it, or nix it, Netanyahu said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering of world leaders.
He also said Israel will act to prevent Iran from establishing permanent military bases in Syria for its air, sea and ground forces.
