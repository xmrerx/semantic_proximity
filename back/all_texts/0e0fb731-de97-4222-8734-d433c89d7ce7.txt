WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis dismissed reports on Thursday that President Donald Trump was considering a plan to oust Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Asked what he made of Tillerson’s reported pending departure, Mattis said: “I make nothing of it.
There’s nothing to it.” He was responding to a shouted question at the beginning of a meeting with the Libyan prime minister at the Pentagon.
