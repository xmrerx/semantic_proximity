wellington ( reuters ) - new zealand prime minister bill english said a final election tally released on saturday did not fundamentally change negotiations between his national party and the nationalist new zealand first party to form a coalition government .
the final count in the sept. 23 election showed national had lost two seats compared to the preliminary count on election night , but remained in the lead with 56 seats , compared to the opposition labour party s 46 .
i don t think it weakens it significantly at all , the fundamentals haven t altered , english told reporters in queenstown in response to a question on his party s negotiation position .
the inconclusive election results have left neither major party with enough votes to form a government without populist new zealand first , which holds nine seats .
