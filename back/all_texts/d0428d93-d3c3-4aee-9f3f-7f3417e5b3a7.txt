As we all know, Donald Trump does not like to read books.
Hell, he really doesn t read anything at all unless it s something that strokes his ego.
But he finally found the perfect book and he humiliated himself by telling the world about it.In a morning Twitter rant on Monday, Trump promoted a book that is literally filled with mostly blank pages.
And conservatives are actually spending their money on it.A great book for your reading enjoyment: REASONS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS by Michael J. Knowles.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2017If you preview the book on Amazon, all you ll find for content is blank pages.
The word count clocks in at 1,235 words over an entire 266 pages.
Basically, it s a waste of paper, ink, and brain cells that only someone like Donald Trump and his conservative fans appreciate.
You know, because reading something of substance is hard.Here s just a couple screenshot of the pages within the book.
It goes on and on like that throughout and it s easy to see why Trump likes to read it.
Because there s nothing to really read at all.Keep in mind, Trump s tweet of admiration for this piece of right-wing trash comes only a few days after his daughter Ivanka tweeted about the importance of reading.This #NationalLibraryWeek, we honor our libraries and librarians for opening our eyes to the world of knowledge, learning and reading!
Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 14, 2017Clearly, her dad doesn t pay attention to her posts.Twitter users were unimpressed by Trump s book choice and proceeded to humiliate him for it.

I m trying to get started That is a quote from someone who has clearly never read a book Edward Hardy (@EdwardTHardy) April 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump Here s a book you should read, assuming you can spare some time between golfing and war-mongering pic.twitter.com/1b3XcHGXdD Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) April 17, 2017@Harry1T6 @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump The leader of the free world just promoted a troll book.
#TheEndIsNigh Warpath von Drumpf (@Warpath72) April 17, 2017@Warpath72 @Harry1T6 @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump It s because it s written at his preferred reading level: grade 1.
Adam Whisler (@WhislerA) April 17, 2017The perfect book for Trump, since it s nothing but blank pages.
(aka right wing humor. )

Julia Reiss (@thereisspiece) April 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump Glad to see you could find a book on your reading level.
Julia Reiss (@thereisspiece) April 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump I call BS, you don t read books, which as far as your supporters are concerned is fine with them.
Besides they prefer burning books ?

Mark Gagliardi (@MarkGags) April 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump The Trump Book Club is 4 vintage issues of Hustler and the entire Animorphs series.
RJ City (@RJCity1) April 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump Unless you personally read it, you shouldn t be recommending it.
And we know you don t read.
Speters (@PalmBayGirl6) April 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump Thanks for the recommendation on where I can find something to wipe my ass with?
Tyler (@tymitch1982) April 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump We can change the title and keep the blank pages for your next book: All I accomplished as a US president .
