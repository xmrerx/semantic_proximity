REMEMBER THIS?
If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.
yep, that was Obama speaking to an audience in Philadelphia Oh wait, we ve got more I want you to argue with them, get in their face YET OBAMA HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT TRUMP: In fact it s been interesting when you look at what s happening with Mr. Trump when he has made some of the remarks that, for example, challenge the heroism of Mr. McCain, someone who endured torture and conducted himself with exemplary patriotism.
Uh.
The Republican party is shocked and yet that arises out of a culture where those kind of outrageous attacks have become far too commonplace and get circulated nonstop through the internet, and talk radio and news outlets.
And, I recognize that when outrageous statements are made about me, a lot of the same people who were outraged when they were made about Mr. McCain were pretty quiet.
