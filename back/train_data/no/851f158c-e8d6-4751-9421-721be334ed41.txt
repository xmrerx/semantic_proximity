this ass-clown reminds us of why term limits are so important .
leisa and i saw rep. rangel ( d-ny ) up close and personal last week when we visited the capitol building as guests of rep. mike bishop ( r-mi ) .
we were shocked at some of the people who have been elected to represent our nation .
20 % of the house members looked like they should be roaming the halls of a nursing home not the halls of congress !
these people have no business making serious decisions on behalf of our country .
charlie rangel is a perfect example of our assertion it s no secret that democrats can t stand the tea party , but rarely do they express their hatred out loud like rep. charlie rangel did .
in a moment caught on camera , the democrat congressman let reporters know what he really thinks about the coalition of citizens who believe in individual liberty and small government ( some of whom are undoubtedly his own constituents ) .theblaze reports : rep. charlie rangel ( d-n.y. ) had harsh words for tea party republicans during a town hall he hosted tuesday in new york city .
the outspoken democrat was asked by theblaze about what he thinks motivates the more conservative wing of the house republicans .
they come from states that used to own slaves , rangel said of his tea party colleagues .
they come from states that the confederate army was pledged allegiance to .
they come from states that the ku klux klan and voters rights and all of those things came into play .
[ t ] hey left the democratic party , thank god , they joined the republican party and they like being among themselves , rangel added.they even got his comments on video here : via : deneenborelli
