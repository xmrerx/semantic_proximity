robin williams was a one-of-a-kind comedian .
his brand of humor can never be replicated .
fortunately , there are video clips of his performances that can still be found on the internet.the video clip below shows robin williams poking fun at muslims , jihad , 72 virgins , the quran , and taxi drivers .
the best part of the video is near the end , where robin williams actually calls out the audience for the reaction to his jokes , revealing their hypocrisy for bristling at his taxi joke because it was politically incorrect , while believing it was okay to laugh about beating the sh * t out of a muslim terrorist.only robin williams could have gotten away with calling his audience out not their ridiculous hypocrisy in the name of political correctness.watch : robin williams on jihad you are welcome # laughoutloud # saturdaychilloutzone pic.twitter.com/wuzjibgbb7 e i ( @ based4good ) august 19 , 2017
