Another racist just found out the hard way that racism will result in unemployment.Pamela Taylor thought she could get away with insulting First Lady Michelle Obama without consequences.Last month, she posted a racist comparison of Melania Trump and Michelle Obama on Facebook that drew national and local outrage.
It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House, Taylor wrote.
I m tired of seeing an ape in heels.
Taylor worked at the Clay County Development Corporation, a non-profit taxpayer funded organization that works with the state and local government, including Mayor Beverly Whaling, who replied to Taylor post by telling her it made my day.
Comparing black people to apes, monkeys, or gorillas has been considered a racial slur for decades.Whaling remained silent in the wake of being caught supporting Taylor s racism.
Taylor, on the other hand, claimed that criticizing her for being a racist is a hate crime, which did not improve her situation in the slightest.In fact, she was suspended from her job and Whaling resigned in disgrace.And then she was reinstated to the disbelief of many who thought that Taylor would rightfully be terminated since it s clear she can t do her job fairly because of her hatred of black people.But justice soon prevailed as Governor Earl Ray Tomblin s office released a statement announcing that Taylor was removed after the state reached an agreement with the nonprofit s board of directors.
And so, Pamela Taylor no longer has a job, thus creating a job opening for someone who has stronger character and human decency.When will racists learn that what they say and write can be read by their employers?
More recently, a firefighter in Michigan was fired for calling a black woman the N-word on Facebook after the remark was brought to the attention to the fire chief.Clearly, it is time for racists to slither back to the fringes of society where they belong.
Some will undoubtedly whine that their freedom of speech is being attacked, but freedom of speech doesn t mean you can t be fired for saying something stupid, especially when what you say alienates and angers potential customers or opens your organization up to accusations of discrimination.So racists, beware.
People on social media can see what you write, and if they can see it, your boss will end up seeing it, too.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
