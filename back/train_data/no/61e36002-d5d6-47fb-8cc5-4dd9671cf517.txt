washington ( reuters ) - white house chief of staff john kelly said on thursday the trump administration thinks the threat posed by north korea s nuclear weapons capability is currently manageable but pyongyang can not be allowed to develop the ability to strike the u.s. homeland .
a state that has developed a pretty good icbm ( missile ) capability and is developing a pretty good nuclear re-entry vehicle , i would believe ... that that state simply can not have the ability to reach the homeland , kelly said .
right now we think the threat is manageable but over time if it grows beyond where it is today , well , let s hope that diplomacy works , said kelly , a retired marine corps general .
