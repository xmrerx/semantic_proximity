geneva ( reuters ) - aung san suu kyi has set out plans for a new humanitarian project to enable myanmar s rakhine state to emerge as a peaceful and developed region , which a close adviser said showed her determination to fix the country s refugee crisis .
suu kyi said in a televised address on thursday evening that she would invite aid organizations , business leaders and civil society to take part in the initiative , which aims to defuse the violence that has caused 536,000 rohingya muslims to flee from rakhine state to bangladesh in the past two months .
what she s interested in is how to fix this , how to ... give the civilian government , as opposed to the military , the power to deliver aid , reconciliation and rebuilding , said the adviser , who briefed reporters , by telephone , on condition of anonymity .
that s the task she has set herself .
in her speech , suu kyi said that although the government may not be strong , she hoped the strength and generosity of the people would turn the initiative , to be launched on sunday , into a milestone in myanmar s history .
representatives of suu kyi in myanmar could not be reached to confirm the adviser s comments .
but two leading myanmar experts confirmed to reuters that the adviser was close to her .
the united nations has called the violence in myanmar a textbook example of ethnic cleansing , and the nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi has been widely criticized for failing to take action to stop it .
she is appalled by what she has seen .
she does care deeply about this .
i know that does not always come across .
but she really does , suu kyi s adviser told reporters .
but she had to tread carefully in order not to inflame things further , he said , saying myanmar s transition to democracy was in a perilous position .
