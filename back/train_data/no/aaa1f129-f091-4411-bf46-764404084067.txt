with 70 days until election day and hillary clinton still up ( significantly ) in the polls , it appears republicans may be doubting who they chose as their presidential nominee.according to a new poll released from huffpost/yougov on monday , 54 percent of republican and republican-leaning voters said donald trump is not the best nominee for their party .
that number is up 10 points since this question was last asked in june , when 44 percent said he was not the best option .
monday s poll also showed that only 35 percent of republicans were satisfied with trump being the nominee , down from 44 percent in june.however , republicans feel they are stuck .
when asked if they could have a do-over in the primaries , only 39 percent said they would choose someone different .
ted cruz , trump s closest rival , garnered 15 percent among responders , with marco rubio coming in third at 14 percent , and the rest of the candidates divvied up among 10 points .
twenty-nine percent said they would still have backed trump.in contrast , 53 percent of democrats who were polled are content with clinton being their party s nominee , while 37 percent do not.republicans , you reap what you sow .
it must suck to have a candidate throwing an election away , killing the party chances of taking back the house , and making a mockery of the united states abroad .
the gop made their bed and now they are going to lie in it.with the senate and supreme court hanging in the balance for republicans , trump has continued a campaign of foot-in-mouth , angering many right-wing diehards like ann coulter and sarah palin for a supposed flip-flop on immigration , while simultaneously keeping moderate republicans at arm s length.in other words , the gop is having a complete meltdown .
trump , once seen as the conservative savior for the republican party , is not hated by factions on both sides of the ideological coin.featured image via stephen maturen/getty images
