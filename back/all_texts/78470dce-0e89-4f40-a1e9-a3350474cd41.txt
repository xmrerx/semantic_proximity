Tuesday morning on The View, the panel discussed Donald Trump s latest Twitter rant which included saying that people who burn the American flag should face consequences, including either a loss of citizenship or time in jail.Here s the tweet:Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag if they do, there must be consequences perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016The big problem with that is the fact that, albeit burning the flag can be seen as incredibly disrespectful, citizens are free to do so.
In fact, it is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
It is a form of free speech and dissent, in fact, patriotic.The ladies of The View brought up this very point, and resident lawyer Sunny Hostin brought up the fact that these comments made by Trump reek of a dictatorship.Trump needs to realize that you don t have to agree with everything a person does or says, if it is within compliance of the law, it is not illegal and thus a punishment cannot be given.
The moment you start giving out punishments based on personal opinion and not the law you are getting into the very scary realm of a dictatorship.The United States was founded on freedom, and part of that freedom is the freedom to protest.
Trump needs to get that into his head.Watch the panel discuss Trump here:.
@Sunny says Trump s tweet about repercussions for burning the American flag reeks of a dictatorship.
