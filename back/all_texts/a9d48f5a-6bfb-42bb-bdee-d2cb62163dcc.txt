During the first half of their extended post-election coverage Wednesday evening, NBC Nightly News seemed to be setting the ground work for four years of a President Donald Trump all while stoking the left s anxieties.
There were gasps around the world.
Headlines, Trumpocalypse and Disunited States hyped NBC s Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel as he delved into the ridiculous, But there are deeper concerns tonight that the world s shining light of democracy has gone dark.
You cannot look at President Trump and call the American president the leader of the free world fretted the leftist Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer to Engel, Because America has increasingly abdicated its legitimacy to that title.
Engel claimed that the only world leaders to welcome a President Trump was a vast array of some of the world worst despots, Those welcoming the most were right-wing parties, who rushed to embrace Trump as their new hero.
Engels was eager to tie as many of them to Trump as possible: He s like me, joked the Filipino president, accused of turning his police into anti-narco death squads.
Egypt s General Sisi, who came to power in a coup bragged he was the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump.
And Hungary s Victor Orban who did wall out his country to keep out refugees called Trump great news.
And of course, Russia s Vladimir Putin.
