srinagar , india ( reuters ) - militants attacked the convoy of a minister in the restive indian state of jammu and kashmir on thursday , killing at least two bystanders and injuring several others though the minister escaped unhurt , police said .
a grenade hurled at the motorcade of jammu and kashmir public works minister naeem akhtar exploded on the road after hitting a security vehicle , senior state police official manoj pandita told reuters .
akhtar , who was on his way to inaugurate a project in the town of tral in south kashmir , told reuters he was safe .
the incident occurred despite tightened security in the town , which was home to former militant leader burhan wani whose death last year at the hands of indian forces sparked massive protests that led to dozens more deaths .
india has been fighting a long-running counter-insurgency campaign in muslim-majority kashmir , which both india and pakistan claim in full but rule in part .
new delhi accuses pakistan of pushing in militants from its part of kashmir to carry out attacks , a charge denied by islamabad .
so far this year , around 44 civilians have been killed in militant attacks in the state , passing the highest annual total seen in the last eight years , according to the south asia terrorism portal .
