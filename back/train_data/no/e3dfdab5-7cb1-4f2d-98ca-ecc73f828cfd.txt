bucharest ( reuters ) - thousands of romanians protested in freezing weather across the country on sunday against attempts by the ruling social democrats to overhaul the judiciary , which critics said would threaten the rule of law .
in bucharest , an estimated 4,000 protesters marched from government headquarters to parliament , where lawmakers will begin debating changes on monday to the criminal code .
earlier this month , the social democrats used their solid majority to approve a judicial overhaul in the lower house that threatens to put the justice system under political control .
the senate is expected to approve the bills next week .
the european commission , the u.s. state department , the country s centrist president and thousands of magistrates have criticized the changes to judicial legislation , saying they could derail the rule of law .
the government denies this is the case .
outside parliament , the marchers chanted thieves nest and we want justice , not corruption under sleet and rain .
thousands more protested in the cities of iasi , cluj , timisoara and others .
attempts by the ruling social democrats to change anti-corruption legislation have taken place on and off throughout 2017 in one of the european union s most corrupt states .
romania s anti-corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 deputies and senators to trial since 2006 alongside cabinet ministers , a sitting prime minister and hundreds of mayors and other public officials .
the speakers of parliament s lower house and senate are both currently on trial in separate cases .
