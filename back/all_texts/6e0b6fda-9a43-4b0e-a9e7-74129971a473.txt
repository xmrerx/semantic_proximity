SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Electronic Frontier Foundation sued the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday in an attempt to obtain any secret court orders forcing companies like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) or Google (GOOGL.O) to decrypt user communications.
The tech advocacy groupâ€™s lawsuit, filed in San Francisco federal court, seeks to force DOJ to disclose whether it has ever sought or obtained a decryption order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
