Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (TN) decided to launch an online poll to ask, Do you support the repeal of Obamacare?
RT if you do, and share what you want to see as the replacement.
OK, we know online polls aren t for reals but conservatives tell us they are so we re just going to believe them this one time.
And the survey says: 84 percent do not want Obamacare repealed.
Only 16 percent called for a repeal.Do you support the repeal of Obamacare?
RT if you do, and share what you want to see as the replacement.

(@melindafla) January 4, 2017@MarshaBlackburn Repealing without a simultaneous replacement is deeply irresponsible.
GOP has had six years to come up with a plan.
Christopher Coleman (@ccineastnash) January 3, 2017In 2014, Blackburn said Obamacare is a failure because Medicaid expansion wasn t happening.
So, a journalist pointed out to her that her own state blocked Medicaid expansion from happening.
But she knew that already.
