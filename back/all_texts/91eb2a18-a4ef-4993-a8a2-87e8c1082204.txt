Our weekly documentary screening curated by the editorial team at 21WIRE.Editor s Note: Although this is not an actual documentary film, this powerful interview segment is a must-see in order to grasp the concept of the Deep State in America, and further into the international arena.
In this seminal interview segment, author Mike Lofgren, a congressional staff member for 28 years, talks to veteran broadcaster Bill Moyers about Washington s shadow government now commonly referred to as the Deep State, where elected and unelected figures collude to protect and serve powerful vested interests.
It is how we had deregulation, financialization of the economy, the Wall Street bust, the erosion or our civil liberties and perpetual war, says Lofgren.
