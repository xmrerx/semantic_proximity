sydney ( reuters ) - australia will introduce random searches of workers entering and inside its airports as it increases security after a recent foiled terrorism plot , officials said .
these measures strengthen existing controls to ensure airport workers are authorized , properly identified and appropriately trained before entering secure airside areas , minister for infrastructure and transport darren chester said in a statement sunday .
they may also be subject to security screening in the course of their duties .
airport security was tightened in july after police foiled islamic-inspired plans for a bomb attack on an emirates flight from sydney .
police said they arrested four men in city-wide raids on july 28 after one of them days earlier had allegedly tried to bring an improvised explosive device on to a flight .
the device was not allowed aboard as it exceeded the baggage weight limit .
extra screening of hand and checked luggage since the incident has led to some travel delays around the country .
some of the measures will be obvious to the public , some will not be , prime minister malcolm turnbull said at the time .
the council of australian governments earlier this month signed off on a facial biometric agreement to give state and federal police real-time access to passport , visa , citizenship and driver s license images for criminal investigations including those involving suspected terrorists .
the prime minister denied the agreement was big brother -style mass surveillance , but the logical next step .
the alternative is to not use the data at all , he told the abc s am program .
the infrastructure minister s office did not respond sunday when asked when the latest measures would take effect , but said they would be rolled out to provide flexibility for airports to ensure continue to function efficiently and effectively .
