The Donald Trump supporter who viciously assaulted an African-American protester at a recent campaign rally gave a terrifying interview to Inside Edition, and it confirms what many of us have sensed for a long time: It s only a matter of time before someone gets killed at a Trump rally.TV s Inside Edition caught up with the cowboy hat wearing Trump fan after the rally and asked him about why he sucker punched a young black man as he was being escorted out of the stadium.
The man, whom police have identified as 78-year-old John McGraw, was all smiles.
He beamed as he told the camera: You bet I liked it.
Knocking the hell out of that big mouth.
When asked why he needed to punch the 26-year-old, McGraw let his crazy fly at full force: We don t know if he s ISIS.
We don t know who he is, but we know he s not acting like an American, cussing me.
If he wants it laid out, I laid it out.
McGraw believes the African American protester was from ISIS.
However, his delusional bloodlust didn t end there.
He went on to say that the man deserved it and warned that next time we see him, we might have to kill him.
He again reiterated the idea that the man was a terrorist.The victim, Rakeem Jones, was reportedly sore but fine after the incident.
However, police at the event decided to arrest him instead of McGraw.McGraw s violence is just another example of a disturbing trend at Trump rallies.
As protesters continue to bravely come out to interrupt the Republican front-runner where ever he goes, his fans have taken to physically assaulting them.
Based on McGraw s statements, the violence is inspired in part by delusional conspiracies gleaned from Fox News and the GOP that pretends Islamic terrorists, black people, and liberals are working together to destroy America.
As such, people like McGraw feel no remorse for attacking them.Don t believe it, just let him tell you himself.Featured image via screen capture from Inside Edition
