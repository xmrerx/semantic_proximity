Just remember, the woman who believes Hillary is the best candidate for the job because she has a vagina, is the same person who thought America needed the first Black President to bring us together Never mind that the only thing keeping Hillary from spending the next two decades in jail is the first black President Oprah endorsed 8 years ago.Oprah Winfrey is throwing her support behind Hillary Clinton.Winfrey spoke with ET s Nancy O Dell at the premiere of her new OWN drama, Greenleaf, and the media mogul opened up about the possibility of America electing its first female president.
I really believe that is going to happen, said Winfrey, 62.
It s about time that we make that decision.
Regardless of your politics, it s a seminal moment for women, she continued.
What this says is, there is no ceiling, that ceiling just went boom!
It says anything is possible when you can be leader of the free world.
I m with her, Oprah added, touting Clinton s campaign slogan and effectively endorsing the former Secretary of State.
Clinton, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for president, was also recently endorsed by President Barack Obama, who declined to back any candidate until the primaries had ended.
