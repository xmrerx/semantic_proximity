On Monday, while FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers sat through a grueling, hours-long hearing, Donald Trump was busily thumbing his way to oblivion on Twitter but some of his tweets got fact-checked in real time.The Donald leaped on an opportunity to speak up for his friend Vladimir Putin when both individuals explained that they did not make an assessment whether or not Russian interference influenced our electoral process The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.

Asked if the tweet is accurate, Comey explained that they have offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it s never something that we looked at.
This, of course, has been the FBI and NSA s position from the beginning and it has not changed.
It it shameful that Donald Trump would attempt to misrepresent testimony in this way.
