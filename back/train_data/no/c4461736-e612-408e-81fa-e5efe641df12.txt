of course anyone on obama s team fundamental transformation of america is exempt from any of the consequences the rest of america would have to face for the same unlawful actions to meet the obama administration s goal of implementing a robust diversity strategy at the department of defense ( dod ) , the agency s director of diversity violated government rules by distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to controversial leftist groups .
adding insult to injury , a consulting firm gets nearly half a million dollars from the dod to help distribute the money to groups even those that don t qualify that support the pentagon s diversity strategy and program objectives .
among the recipients is the notorious open borders group league of united latin american citizens ( lulac ) , minority access inc. , a maryland-based nonprofit committed to decreasing disparities and reducing incidences of environmental injustices , and the renowned national association for the advancement of colored people ( naacp ) .
others include the society of american indian government employees and the asian american government executive network .
in all , the pentagon s office of diversity management and equal opportunity ( odme ) gave these and other groups north of $ 300,000 , according to a dod inspector general report released this month .
these are considered affinity groups involved with networking or professional associations that are often race , ethnic background or gender based , according to the report.the high-ranking official who violated dod and government rules by doling out the cash to unqualified non-federal entities ( nfe ) is clarence johnson , the dod s director of office of diversity management and equal opportunity .
in 2010 johnson , a veteran pentagon official , was assigned to assist the army in implementing a robust diversity strategy .
the position came with a hefty budget to support diversity outreach functions and johnson launched a cash giveaway , filling the coffers of groups that should not have received public funds .
in its report the dod watchdog concludes that johnson improperly co-sponsored nfes that he had selected .
auditors found that johnson spent $ 301,000 on nfe sponsorships and recommend corrective action .
the money flowed through a company called new concepts management solutions ( ncms ) that was evidently handpicked by johnson .
in 2012 , the office of diversity management hired a consulting firm called deloitte for $ 480,554 to handle the diversity outreach allocations.here s a brief breakdown of how some of the money was divided .
the thurgood marshall college fund leadership institute conference got $ 25,000 , the society of american indian government employees got $ 12,000 for a training conference and a conglomerate called latina style outreach received $ 20,000 .
lulac and the hispanic engineer national achievement awards corporation ( henaac ) received $ 25,000 each .
it appears that johnson knew well that he was violating agency rules when he headed the diversity crusade because the report reveals that the dod office of special counsel has consistently said that the agency should not sponsor non-federal entities like the ones johnson gave money to .
in addition to money , johnson provided these various groups with logistical manpower compliments of uncle sam.it s unlikely that johnson will face any repercussions for his transgressions or , at most , a weak slap on the hand .
he certainly appears confident in testimony to investigators probing his violations .
my job is to grow , or focus on growing , the presence of minorities and women in government jobs with higher pay scales , johnson told investigators .
he added that the mission of his office is diversity outreach , which involves informing the diverse audience .
this is why he seeks affinity groups that have a national reach and influence.president obama has made it his mission to culturally transform government by teaching federal workers about diversity , race and gender , healthcare disparities and cultural competencies .
the effort has affected practically every major agency , including the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and health and human services ( hhs ) , among others .
it s been a costly initiative for taxpayers .
a few months ago a judicial watch investigation found that the obama administration has paid a chicago-based firm millions of dollars to strengthen the federal workplace with its brand of diversity consulting .
this includes two recent dhs contracts for $ 24,000 and $ 10,000 and one for $ 8,500 from the department of energy ( doe ) .
