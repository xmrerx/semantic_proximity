Comedian Dave Chappelle, known for his razor-sharp and hilarious views on race in America, is officially apologizing for asking America to give Trump a chance.Chappelle asked people to give Trump some time to settle into his role as President before judging him last year, during a monologue on Saturday Night Live that aired a few days after the election.
But in a set the comedian performed at Caroline s in New York, he told the audience that he regrets what he said.Chappelle got right to the point with his apology, saying I was the first guy on TV to say Give Trump a chance.
I fucked up.
Sorry.
That time when Dave Chappelle apologized for asking us to give Trump a chance The self-proclaimed "Jane Goodall" of white people now has this to say about Trump's instability, the Muslim ban, and what a black presidency was expected to look like ???

Chappelle said, Every day you wake up and you never know what [Trump] is going to do next.
The comedian also touched on Trump s racism and Islamophobia, bringing up the President s failed Muslim ban, Donald Trump said we shouldn t let any Muslims into the United States until we can figure out what s going on.
And I think that s way out of step with the way people feel in America.
At the time, his SNL monologue got some pushback from media critics who argued that giving Trump a chance to be Presidential, after spending most of his campaign behaving badly, was misguided.Chappelle couched his call for tolerance with a plea for Trump to return the favor, saying at the time, I m wishing Donald Trump luck.
And I m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too.
But clearly Chappelle doesn t feel like Trump has held up his end of the bargain, and it s hard to disagree with that sentiment.
