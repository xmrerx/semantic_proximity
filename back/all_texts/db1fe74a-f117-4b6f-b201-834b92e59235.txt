Everyone has had it with the Donald Trump campaign.
One person, in particular, has decided that enough is enough a 19-year-old named Cameron Edwards from Flint, Michigan.
Edwards wrote a letter to Trump calling for him to end his campaign.In the letter, Edward writes that he did not view Trump s campaign as a joke like most people did.
Edwards writes in the letter: Mr. Trump, when you first announced your bid to be Commander and Chief of this nation, the american people immediately dismissed your campaign as a complete joke, but not me.
I genuinely believed that the people should take the time to listen to your campaign, I told others that it s possible that you may have something to offer, but in reality, I was very wrong.
At that point, Edwards goes on to list some of the things that Trump has become known for over the past few months in the election.
This includes the endorsement that Trump received from former KKK leader, David Duke.
Trump s non-stop scapegoating of Muslims, immigrants, and people of color.Those, however, are criticisms anyone can make.
Edwards, on the other hand, has a very good question that Trump would hate to answer.
What exactly is so great that Trump is offering?
Which is exactly what every Trump supporter should be asked.
Why would Trump s America be great for a young black man living in Flint?
Do you not see the message that you are sending to us?
Why would someone like me even be interested in your America?
Can you even give me ONE real reason why I should believe that I have an actual shot as a black teenager in your America?
As far as I know, you haven t done anything to reach out to OBVIOUSLY concerned communities like mine.
Please remember, I am a Flint resident, and like other members of this community, we are wondering why you and other republicans alike haven t reached out to us.
The U.S. is a mosaic of people.
Trump s America might be great for you if you are well of financially and are white (it still probably won t be, though).
For everyone else, it would be a disaster.
Every WASP supporter that Trump has to have at least one person in their life that would fall into the everyone else category.Edwards ends his blistering letter to Trump calling for him to end his campaign.
Edwards writes: Mr. Trump, it is obvious that you are not interested in uniting this nation, and with the growing threat of violence within your campaign, I believe as a moral adult, that you MUST end your campaign to prevent people from getting hurt any further.
It is simply the right thing to do.
Outside of a few grammatical errors, there is only one major problem with Edwards letter.
