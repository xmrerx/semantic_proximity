as trump s first 100 days in office come to a close , the administration is desperate to put together a list of accomplishments that looks like a showcase of trump s sheer leadership prowess .
this desperation comes because trump has accomplished pretty much nothing at all .
most of those so-called accomplishments are executive orders that do squat , he hasn t managed to get any legislation through congress at all , and his approval rating is at a record-low 41 percent.other presidents fared much better during their first 100 days , and some people , like jimmy carter s presidential library , won t hesitate to needle trump with their own statistics .
observe : jimmy carter s first 100 days .. laws passed : 22 executive orders : 16 approval rating : 63 percent jimmy carter library ( @ carterlibrary ) april 24 , 2017by contrast , trump has signed 23 executive orders that he s claiming are accomplishments , such as a federal hiring freeze .
wow .
putting a halt to hiring federal workers is so difficult , is it not ? he s also trumpeting his job creation successes , which include greenlighting both the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines , and his buy american , hire american initiative .
neither of these orders is really going to accomplish anything .
nor will his buy american steel initiative considering that the pipelines have long since purchased their steel , and most of it isn t american.he s touting the wall as an accomplishment too , even though congress isn t likely to fund it , and he s listing his muslim ban , which has been halted in federal court and has likewise done nothing.indeed , all he can really claim as an accomplishment at all is getting neil gorsuch confirmed to the supreme court .
carter had a tumultuous first 100 days , too , but at least he managed to get an economic stimulus package through congress .
trump hasn t gotten any major legislation through at all.featured image by molly riley-pool via getty images
