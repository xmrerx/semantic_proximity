So it s just too damn early to tell if the Dallas massacre of white police officers is a hate crime?
Perhaps Jeh Johnson needs a refresher course in what a hate crime is how about when someone kills people and says it s because they re white cops?
Even the Dallas Police Chief read off the comments by Micah Johnson that told everyone EXACTLY why he did what he did.
Why the confusion?
Could it be that Obama has told his cabinet members to tow the government line and play like they still don t know why the Dallas massacre happened?
What a bunch of jackwagons!During a Sunday morning interview with CBS s John Dickerson, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson stated though Dallas shooter Micah Johnson told hostage negotiators he wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, it s still relatively early to qualify his actions as a hate crime.
You said there s no link to a terrorist organization here, but the shooting in Dallas was by any definition terrorism and a hate crime, wasn t it?
posed Dickerson.
Well, there s still an investigation being conducted by the Dallas police department and the FBI supported by many resources from the local government and the federal government, Johnson responded.
So it s still relatively early.
WILL THIS CLEAR IT ALL UP FOR JEH JOHNSON:OBAMA S COMMENT ON THE ATTACK MIRRORS JOHNSON S: I think it s very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter.
As we ve seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are by definition troubled.
