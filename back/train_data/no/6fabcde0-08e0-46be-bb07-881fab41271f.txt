johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s opposition democratic alliance will lay a criminal complaint against mckinsey for fraud , racketeering and collusion over work the global consultancy did with businessmen friends of president jacob zuma , it said on monday .
reuters reported last week that mckinsey ignored suspicions raised over several years by local senior staff that companies it worked with were set up to steer state contracts .
the deal relates to work mckinsey carried out for south african state power company eskom alongside trillian , a firm controlled by the gupta family .
the allegations that mckinsey ignored warnings from senior south african staff , as far back as the beginning of 2013 , of possible dodgy deals with trillian , eskom and other gupta-linked companies must be fully investigated , the da said .
