While Megyn Kelly is a Fox News anchor, and she definitely toes the GOP line on most things, it s hard to deny that, when it comes to women and women s issues, Kelly is pretty spot-on about things.
This never shines more than when she s talking about Donald Trump s misogyny.
Trump s campaign manager is a woman, but when Kelly put the screws to her over that very issue, she can t even really formulate an answer.Kellyanne Conway, who regularly appears on Fox News to speak for Trump, appeared to try her best to downplay the blatantly sexist pig that is the Republican presidential candidate.
She said that he d just made a couple of comments over the last 25 years, as if saying that women need to be treated like shit, that leaving his own wife on the tarmac for being five minutes late, and bashing Kelly herself over her questions about his sexism, is really just nothing.Kelly hit her back with: You know that s not true.
You know.
know he has repeatedly made comments about women, about their looks, about their size, their weight.
Even in this campaign, talking about [former GOP presidential candidate] Carly Fiorina s face, retweeting a negative picture about Heidi Cruz s face, criticizing Hillary Clinton and her look.
And, Kellyanne, this is an issue for him, is it not?
All Conway could do in response was criticize Hillary s campaign and debate topics.
