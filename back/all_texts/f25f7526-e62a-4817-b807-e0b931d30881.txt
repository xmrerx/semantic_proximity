Fox News anchor Bret Baier was a surprise visitor at Mar-a-Lago on Thanksgiving weekend.
Speculation swirled that Baier s attendance was a sign of media bias or collusion between President Trump and Fox News.
Why else would Baier have dinner at the president s exclusive club?It was actually a coincidence Baier and his wife were spending the weekend with Jack Nicklaus who is a member of Mar-a-Lago.
Fox News clarified the chance meeting with a tweet:Fox News statement on this photo: "Bret Baier and his wife attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lago as a guest of Jack Nicklaus, whose home they were staying at for the weekend.
He was asked to take a photo with Nicklaus and the President and obliged."

These people are relentless and brutal in their judgement of others.
We thought the left considered themselves to be a tolerant group We re guessing their tolerance is extended to everyone BUT conservatives.
