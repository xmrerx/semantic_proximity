maiduguri , nigeria ( reuters ) - a suicide bomber killed 13 other people in the northeast nigerian city of maiduguri on sunday , a police official said , the deadliest attack in over a month as the conflict with boko haram stretches into its ninth year .
the evening attack , which also injured five people , struck the city s muna garage area , damian chukwu , a police commissioner , told reuters .
the area is home to a camp for just some of the more than 2 million people who have fled fighting with the boko haram islamist insurgency , which has left over 20,000 dead .
that conflict , the epicenter of which is in northeastern nigeria , is showing little sign of slowing , despite assurances by the government and military that boko haram is on the verge of defeat .
on friday , the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs warned that attacks against civilians - including suicide bombings in and near idp ( internally displaced person ) camps - continue to be a major concern .
two suicide bombers also injured 13 other people in a separate attack , said chukwu .
