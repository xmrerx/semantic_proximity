Remember when Rand Paul drilled Hillary Clinton on whether she knew about arms being shipped to jihadists?
That was a classic moment because her response was a well scripted look of attempted ignorance.
If you know Hillary, you know in this moment she was lying her a@@ off.
It s epic check it out: HILLARY LIES THROUGH HER TEETH WHILE UNDER OATH: You would think our Republican Congress would push harder on this but who knows if people like former congressman Mike Rodgers (MI) might have been involved in the arms shipments.
It has been reported that he had involvement in this.The key thing in all this is that it reveals Hillary to be totally incompetent as Secretary of State.
It would also be nice if she was prosecuted for perjury I m not holding my breath.Via: Gateway Pundit
