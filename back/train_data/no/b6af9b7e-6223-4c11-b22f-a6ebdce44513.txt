rome ( reuters ) - former prime minister silvio berlusconi said on tuesday he and the leader of the northern league had agreed a pact to choose the candidate to head an eventual center-right governing coalition , a newspaper reported .
italy is expected to hold a national election by march that polls suggest the center-right would win , though it would be unlikely to obtain a working majority of seats in parliament .
berlusconi was banned from running for office in 2013 due to a tax fraud conviction , but is hoping the european court of human rights will overturn this when it reviews his case in november .
he told the corriere della sera newspaper in an interview that he and matteo salvini agreed that whichever party of the center-right gets more votes would propose a prime minister for the center-right .
according to a poll released by the emg aqua agency on monday , the northern league is running at 14.8 percent , berlusconi s forza italia ( go italy ! )
at 12.2 percent and the third center-right party , brothers of italy , at 5.0 percent .
that makes the trio largest single bloc with about 32 percent .
berlusconi told the newspaper he was convinced forza italia would get the most votes .
he did not say who the party s candidate would be if he could not run .
according to the same poll , the governing center-left democratic party ( pd ) has about 27 percent and the anti-establishment 5-star movement about 28 percent .
