madrid ( reuters ) - dna tests on the exhumed body of salvador dali showed that a spanish woman who brought a paternity suit against him was not his daughter , the surrealist painter s foundation said on wednesday .
the court supervising the tests had informed its lawyers that maria pilar abel was not dali s biological daughter after comparing her dna with samples taken from his remains , the foundation said in a statement .
a spokesman for the court declined to confirm the results of the tests .
contacted by phone , abel said she had not yet received the results from the court .
the madrid court in june ordered forensic scientists to exhume dali s body after abel , who was born in dali s home town of figueres , filed a paternity claim that alleged her mother had an affair with him .
this conclusion is not a surprise for the foundation , since at no point has there been any evidence that she was a relative , said the foundation , which manages dali s estate .
the foundation is happy that this puts an end to an absurd and artificial controversy .
dali , who died in 1989 aged 84 , was one of the 20th century s most famous and easily recognized artists .
his paintings include the persistence of memory , with its iconic images of melting clocks , and he also turned his hand to movies , sculpture and advertising .
