moscow ( reuters ) - tweets by u.s. president donald trump are viewed in moscow as his official position and read by his russian counterpart vladimir putin , the kremlin said on tuesday .
a prolific user of twitter before he was elected late last year , trump has continued to use the social media platform to voice his views on policy and world affairs since moving into the white house .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said on tuesday it was not his place to comment on trump s actions , but added : in any case , everything which is published from his authorised twitter account is perceived by moscow as his official statement .
naturally , it is reported to putin along with other information about official statements by politicians , peskov said , adding that putin was not a twitter user himself .
trump s activity on twitter have previously cause controversy .
his tweets sparked outrage in britain last month and a sharp rebuke of prime minister theresa may when he retweeted anti islam videos from a british far-right group .
