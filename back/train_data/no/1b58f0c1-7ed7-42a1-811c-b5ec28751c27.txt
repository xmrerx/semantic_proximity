johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s justice minister michael masutha on friday denied parole to the killer of anti-apartheid leader chris hani , saying he had not expressed remorse for the murder .
janusz walus has served more than 20 years of a life sentence for the assassination of hani , who was a senior member of the now-ruling african national congress ( anc ) and head of the south african communist party .
walus , 64 , emigrated from communist poland in 1981 and became involved in far-right politics in south africa .
he shot hani outside the anti-apartheid activist s home in 1993 .
the killing triggered nationwide riots that threatened to derail south africa s 1994 transition to multi-racial democracy after decades of white apartheid rule .
masutha also blocked walus parole application in 2015 , a decision that triggered several court challenges .
the supreme court of appeal referred the matter back to the justice minister for reconsideration .
masutha said on friday a psychologist s report had highlighted walus political ideology as a risk factor .
the report said walus expressed remorse for the fact that the victim s children are fatherless and the wife is a widow .
however , he showed no remorse for murdering chris hani .
he still rationalizes his actions and insists that they were politically motivated .
his ideas about communism still stand .
