manila ( reuters ) - about 30 islamist rebels holding an estimated 20 hostages remain in marawi city and military operations continue , an army spokesman said on tuesday , despite president rodrigo duterte s earlier declaration that the southern city had been liberated .
the declaration of the president hopefully gives way for the entry and start of rehabilitation , reconstruction and rebuilding of marawi from the ashes , military spokesman restituto padilla told news channel anc .
the fight for the remaining ground forces continues .
the military was uncertain whether malaysian operative mahmud ahmad was still in the city but he was not known for his skills as a fighter and was therefore not a threat , padilla said .
