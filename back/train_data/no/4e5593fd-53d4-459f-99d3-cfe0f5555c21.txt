who can forget the sweet young dartmouth college student who was part of a larger disruptive , bullying group of students who terrorized other students in the dartmouth library where they were trying to study ?
because cramming your racist views of america trumps everyone else s right to not feel threatened in their college library right ?
it kinda makes one wonder when the administrators at colleges and universities are going to step up and put an end to this nation-wide , white house sanctioned domestic terror effort fast forward to yesterday a controversy has erupted at dartmouth college after a pro-police display was torn down by black lives matter activists , who denounced it for memorializing the perpetrators of state violence .
dartmouth blm protesters tear down memorial to slain policein honor of national police week ( which falls may 15-21 ) , dartmouth s college republicans reserved a bulletin board at the collis center and used it to create a display honoring police officers and firemen who have fallen in the line of duty .
one part of the display noted that 60 police and 343 firemen were killed in the 9/11 attacks , while another declared over 20,000 police officers have been killed while on-duty in the history of the united states.at the bottom , the display said in big letters , blue lives matter .
this last part of the display appears to have outraged black lives matter supporters at dartmouth , several of whom vocally complained on twitter and facebook that the display was offensive and even white supremacist .
# fight4facultyofcolor and students of color because we all woke up to this white supremacist bullshit in collis .

the original display was torn down friday morning , at about 11 a.m , and in its place almost three dozen sheets of paper were used to cover the bulletin board , all of them carrying an identical message : you can not co-opt the movement against state violence to memorialize the perpetrators .
at the bottom , each sheet also had the hashtag # blacklivesmatter printed on it.via : daily caller
