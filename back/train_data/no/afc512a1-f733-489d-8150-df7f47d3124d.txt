bravo !
it s about time the left got called out on their ridiculous claims !
conservative journalists had the cops called on them by a professor who didn t expect this to happen to her : an american university faculty member attempted to make life difficult for journalists covering a campus protest last night , but her plan went awry after she called the police.the washington examiner s ashe schow was at au last night reporting on breitbart tech editor milo yiannopolous visit to campus .
( schow tells me she was there on behalf of a forthcoming documentary , thought police , and was not representing the examiner . )
yiannopoulos is a deliberately controversial figure , and his presence on campus prompted a student protest.a female faculty member now dubbed melissa click 2.0 tried to interfere , telling schow and her camera crew that they were required to accompany her inside .
they had to follow certain regulations that the university is guided by because au is providing a safe space for everybody who works or studies on this campus , she claimed.after the faculty member realized schow s group was recording her , she became hostile .
are you kidding me ?
she asked .
seriously , i m calling the police .
the police didn t immediately respond to her call .
later , when the cops did appear , the faculty member expected them to escort the journalists off campus .
instead , they wanted to have a chat with the faculty member , according to breitbart news .
the police came over and she thought they were going to save her but actually they escorted her away , schow wrote on twitter .
