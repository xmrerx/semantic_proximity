ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey hopes the United States will lift its decision on suspending visa services soon, the spokesman for the ruling AK Party said on Wednesday.
Speaking at an interview with broadcaster A Haber, Mahir Unal said Ankara hopes the escalating dispute between the NATO allies will not impact military operations.
Turkey was holding talks at the foreign ministry level to resolve the U.S. visa crisis, he also said.
