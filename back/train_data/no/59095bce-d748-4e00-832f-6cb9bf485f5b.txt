klayman discusses complaint against rep. adam schiff for obstruction of justice & ethics violations several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the office of congressional ethics .
despite the baselessness of the charges , i believe it is in the best interests of the house intelligence committee and the congress for me to have representative mike conway , with assistance from representatives trey gowdy and tom rooney , temporarily take charge of the committee s russia investigation .
remember when he came out and spoke to the press after speaking to the president ?
well , the democrats raised heck after that and have done everything they can to stop nunes .
note that he has left his position only temporarily .
trey gowdy and others will take his place flashback on nunes:1 . )
on numerous occasions the [ obama ] intelligence community incidentally collected information about u.s. citizens involved in the trump transition .
2 . )
details about u.s. persons associated with the incoming administration ; details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting .
3 . )
third , i have confirmed that additional names of trump transition members were unmasked .
4 . )
fourth and finally , i want to be clear ; none of this surveillance was related to russia , or the investigation of russian activities , or of the trump team .
