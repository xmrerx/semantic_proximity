is everyone else thinking what i m thinking ?
two words come to mind on this one : concealed carry a stroudsburg , pa. , woman suffered a broken eye socket and bruises during the attack , which took place in a local movie theater of all places .
and why did the group of teen girls allegedly pounce on victim cindy santamaria-williams ?
she tells wnep-tv , which broke the story , that she shushed them for being loud and cursing .
worse , the attack didn t occur during the heat of the moment inside the theater .
the woman tells wnep that the girls jumped her after the film let out .
they immediately jumped on me and knocked me to the ground , punched me in the face , she said , adding that the original girls were waiting with five other teens .
she tells wnep that she hopes someone will come forward to help police catch the young suspects : they were in my face .
their face is in my head .
if i see them again or in a line up , i know exactly who they are , santamaria-williams said .
