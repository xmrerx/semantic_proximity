nothing to see here no conflict of interest .
how can anyone wonder why americans have completely lost their ability to trust our corrupt government ? so the attorney general of the united states just happened to run into the former president of the united states who just so happens to be married to a woman running for president , who just happens to be under federal investigation and they just happened to have a 30 minute meeting aboard a government owned airplane and we re to believe that all they talked about was their grandchildren ?
gpwhy did bill clinton and loretta lynch meet on her airplane in phoenix this week ? attorney general loretta lynch met with former president bill clinton for a half-hour on her government airplane at the phoenix airport on tuesday , an arizona news station is reporting.the unannounced meeting , which comes as lynch s justice department is investigating the handling of classified information on hillary clinton s private email server , came to light only when phoenix s abc15 tv station asked lynch about it during a press conference.the obama appointee told the tv station that she and clinton did not discuss the investigation or any other government business .
