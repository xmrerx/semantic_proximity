Remember when the media used to think they controlled the narrative?
That was before President Trump, and his badass communications staff decided this administration wasn t going to be conducting business as usual.
The days of the media bullying Republicans into submission are coming to an end.
And for that monumental achievement, we can all thank the very courageous and determined President Trump Scaramucci promised the heads of White House leakers would roll.
He clearly wasn t kidding It was announced yesterday, that suspected leaker Michael Short had been terminated from the White House communications office.Short, an ally of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and now former Press Secretary Sean Spicer who resigned last week was terminated on Tuesday by new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.This morning, White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci told Chris Cuomo that I m straightly not answering your question when the CNN host asked about the resignation Tuesday of senior assistant press secretary Michael Short.
Watch:Scaramucci said that someone above his rank wanted Short out of his White House position.
When Cuomo asked Scaramucci who above his rank told him to fire the aide, Scaramucci said that he would not answer the question.
I didn t answer the question, Chris, Scaramucci said.
See, I m getting so subtle and surgical in terms of the way I talk to you guys.
A clearly frustrated Chris Cuomo responded, You re as subtle as a heart attack.
Did the president tell you, Get rid of this guy, he s one of the leakers?'
Cuomo asked.
I m not going to answer that question because I just said I wasn t going to answer it, Scaramucci said.
Yeah, I know, but what happened to being straight?
Cuomo asked in reference to Scaramucci saying he would tell it to him straight earlier in the interview.
I m straightly, straightly not answering your question, Scaramucci said.For entire story WFB
