I m sorry I lied.
Those four magic words would have done a lot to prove to the American people that he is, indeed, capable of taking some small step toward redeeming himself after his administration s third fake terrorist attack.
Unfortunately, this is Donald Trump we re talking about and he will not be deterred from believing whatever crazy bullshit he decides to believe at any given moment not by facts, not by reality, and certainly not by those goddamn Swedes.Trump recently baffled the world by referencing a terrorist attack in Sweden that didn t happen after misremembering a Fox News report.
Trump didn t say what happened (though we imagine the perpetrators of the Bowling Green and Atlanta massacres are behind it), but if there was a three strikes and you re out rule when it comes to an administration completely making up f*cking massacres Trump d be out.
Nevertheless, he just kept banging away at Sweden on Monday morning.
Give the public a break The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully, he tweeted, adding (because he s twelve) NOT!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2017So, what s happening in Sweden?
The Independent reports that immigration has helped ful the largest economic boon Sweden has seen in five years:The Swedish government, whose policies saw the country take in more refugees per capita than any other in Europe last year, helped lower unemployment rates by increased spending on welfare for asylum seekers from war torn countries like Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.The move helped the Nordic region s largest economy expand 4.5 percent on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of 2015, the most in almost five years and more than twice the growth of Germany, according to Bloomberg.Increased consumer spending and borrowing and high house prices also contributed to the boom which, although projected to fade, has consolidated Sweden as one of Europe s success stories.Also, a moose fell in love.Trump s decision to continue babbling about Sweden (and, of course, the L genpresse FAKE NEWS) led to widespread mockery:.
@realDonaldTrump Sweden is even confused by your allegations.

@realDonaldTrump @jpublikYou've done it again.Apologies ( for lying ) usually include the words, "sorry", "regret" or "apologise" British Sceptic (@ElNuevoOtroMio2) February 20, 2017@realDonaldTrump dude, you're only making it worse.
Kristina Poe (@Kpoepoe) February 20, 2017@realDonaldTrump How many more fake terrorist attacks are you going to make up before you open the camps?
Patrick S. Tomlinson (@stealthygeek) February 20, 2017Trump s unabashed aversion to facts was troubling when he was leading a movement that thought Barack Obama was a Muslim Kenyan or suggesting that vaccines cause autism or even when he was leading lock her up chants as his rabid followers called for Hillary Clinton s death.
But now he s President.
He has the power to destroy every relationship the United States has built with his ridiculous statements, arrogance, and f*cking moronic tweets.featured image via Getty Images(Alex Wong)/screengrab
