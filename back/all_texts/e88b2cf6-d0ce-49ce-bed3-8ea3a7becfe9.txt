Donald Trump decided to deflect the utter humiliation he is feeling over Saturday Night Live by trying to convince everyone that most Americans like him.
Twitter quickly shattered his ego.Alec Baldwin triumphantly returned to portray Trump last night and he had plenty of material to work with.
But the focus was on Trump s first press conference in six months and the intelligence dossier that details how Trump hired prostitutes in Moscow to pee in the bed at the Ritz Carlton presidential suite.After being perfectly roasted on SNL, the world expected Trump to throw a temper tantrum for the ages on Twitter.
Instead, Trump responded by insisting that everyone likes him, even Obama Democrats, while also bragging that he is bringing jobs back to America.The Democrats are most angry that so many Obama Democrats voted for me.
With all of the jobs I am bringing back to our Nation, that number.. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017will only get higher.
Car companies and others, if they want to do business in our country, have to start making things here again.
WIN!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017Seriously, Trump actually thinks Democrats voted for him by a landslide and thinks all the jobs that companies have been creating in this country recently are because of him.Of course, Trump is full of shit and Twitter tore him apart.
@realDonaldTrump Lost popular vote by 3 million never forget.

Liar.

@realDonaldTrump The only one who s angry right now is Donald.
Sweetheart, we only have a few days to get these emotions under control.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump Nope!
All Americans are angry that a fat, stupid, fascist puppet of Russia will be installed as a fake president.
Sad!

Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump just to check, are you saying you prefer people do their business where you can watch them?
