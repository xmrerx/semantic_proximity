new york ( reuters ) - connecticut ’ s lawmakers are aiming to pass an austerity budget for the coming financial year on wednesday that cuts spending by nearly $ 1 billion as the state struggles with revenues that are falling well short of projections .
details of a deal reached between governor dannel malloy and fellow democrats were sparse early on wednesday afternoon as budget staffers rushed to prepare the documents ahead of a vote later in the day .
the budget for fiscal year 2016-2017 , which starts on july 1 , will cut spending by $ 830 million , divert $ 100 million from transportation and other funds and sweep $ 30 million from various agency accounts , said adam joseph , a spokesman for connecticut senate democrats .
the spending plan is aimed at closing a $ 960 million hole in next year ’ s finances that officials have blamed on falling capital gains tax receipts due to a volatile stock market .
malloy proposed an $ 18.14 billion general fund budget in february that cut discretionary spending but did not raise taxes .
since then the projected revenue shortfall for next year ballooned from $ 560 million to its current $ 960 million .
the state ’ s legislative session ends at midnight on wednesday but the budget vote could keep legislators up until the small hours .
both chambers of connecticut ’ s general assembly are dominated by democrats .
connecticut , despite being one of the wealthiest states in the nation on a per capita income basis , has struggled to recover from the financial crisis and recession of 2007-2009 .
the state also faces a gap of around $ 260 million in the current fiscal year , despite a series of cuts .
malloy has said 2,000 state employees could be laid off in what he calls a “ new economic reality. ” the governor has also frozen pay rises for managers in state government .
