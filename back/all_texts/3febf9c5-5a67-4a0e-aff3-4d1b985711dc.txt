CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois’ first full-year budget since 2015 became law on Thursday after the House of Representatives overrode the governor’s vetoes of a $36 billion fiscal 2018 spending plan and a companion measure that implements it.
The House’s actions followed the Senate’s successful override votes on Tuesday.
