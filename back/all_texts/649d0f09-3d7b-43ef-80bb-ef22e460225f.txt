Donald Trump really needs to keep his mouth shut because that s apparently the only way he ll be able to act presidential instead of petty.Prior to a performance of Hamilton on Broadway Friday night, the crowd booed as Mike Pence walked into theater.
At the end, the cast read a message to Pence telling him that they hope he learned something from seeing the play.But rather than let it go at that, Donald trump lashed out when he heard about the booing and the message.Trump whined that the theater is supposed to be a safe space and demanded that Hamilton apologize to Mike Pence for being rude.
Our wonderful future V.P.
Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence.
Apologize!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016Trump s temper tantrum was so pathetic that Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr in the play, responded.
@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir.
And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.
Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016And other Twitter users piled on.
@realDonaldTrump oh no!
Someone got their feelings hurt!
Want me to hold your hand next time?

@realDonaldTrump Actually what WAS rude was driving a motorcade thru the Lincoln Tunnel during Rush Hour.
To get to your golf course.
Jim Roberts (@nycjim) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump Wait, I think I m on to something: You think politely and calmly expressing your desired to be treated equally is rude.
1/2 Terrence O Brien (@TerrenceOBrien) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump But screeching hate from a stage isn t. You have some sort of mental disease where you see the opposite of reality!
2/2 Terrence O Brien (@TerrenceOBrien) November 19, 2016@realDonaldTrump They read a respectful prepared statement.
Grow up.
Erik Anderson (@erianderson) November 19, 2016There s a lot more where those came from, but the bottom line is that Trump spent a year and a half using divisive, hateful, bigoted, and disrespectful rhetoric and now he is whining about Pence being booed.
Seriously, Donald Trump is going to be a petty tyrant in the White House and he continues to demonstrate that he doesn t have the temperament and is too thin-skinned to be president.Featured Image: Ethan Miller/Getty Images
