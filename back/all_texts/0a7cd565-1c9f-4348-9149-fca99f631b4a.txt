MADRID (Reuters) - Sacked Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on Saturday called for a democratic opposition to Madrid s takeover of the region following its declaration of independence.
It s very clear that the best form of defending the gains made up until now is democratic opposition to article 155, Puigdemont said in a brief statement.
