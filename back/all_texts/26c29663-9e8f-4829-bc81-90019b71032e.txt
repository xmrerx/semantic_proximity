GOP congressman Steve King (R-IA) had endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump after Ted Cruz ended his presidential campaign, but a recent statement of his is raising some eyebrows he actually praised Trump s rival in a speech!On Thursday, King told a crowd at the Iowa State Fair that he and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton can barely see eye to eye on anything and if he were to be re-elected, he ll break out of my shell if I have to do battle with an agenda that Iowans reject.
However, King said the former Secretary of State is somebody I can work with if she were to win this election.
King s full statement to the audience, as quoted by the Des Moines Register s Jason Noble, was: If it s Hillary Clinton, we don t agree on very much.
So you ll probably see me become a vocal member of Congress if you should elect me to go back to Washington after November.But I also know that I ve sat across the table with Hillary Clinton eye-to-eye, and when you re working outside of staff and outside of press, she is somebody I can work with.
You can listen to King s remarks below:That almost sounds like resignation to the fact that Trump is destroying his campaign and dragging the GOP down with him.
Coming from an elected Republican like King, this is a pretty powerful statement especially considering all that the Republican Party has done to smear Clinton s name.
Of course, King is still going to vote for Trump in November, but it sounds like he s coming around to accepting Clinton as the probable next president of the United States.Clinton has been smart in recognizing that so many anti-Trump moderate GOPers are looking for their place in this election, and she is positioning herself as someone who can unite people.
Clearly, it is working.
As Trump continues to grow more insane and violent in his rhetoric, we can only expect to see more statements like this coming from prominent GOPers.Featured image via Darren McCollester / Getty Images
