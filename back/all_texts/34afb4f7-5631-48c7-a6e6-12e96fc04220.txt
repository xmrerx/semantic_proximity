LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday the world would stand together against North Korea after the country fired a missile that flew over Japan into the Pacific Ocean, ratcheting up tensions after Pyongyang s test of a powerful nuclear bomb.
Yet another illegal missile launch by North Korea, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted.
UK and international community will stand together in the face of these provocations.
