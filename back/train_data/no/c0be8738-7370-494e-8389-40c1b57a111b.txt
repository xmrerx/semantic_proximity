nairobi ( reuters ) - a gunman shot and wounded a bodyguard to kenya s deputy chief justice on tuesday , police said , adding to an increasingly tense atmosphere two days before the east african nation is due to hold a repeat presidential election .
rashid mohamed , the officer in charge of dagoretti police station , told reuters it was unclear why the bodyguard to deputy chief justice philomena mwilu was shot or how many attackers there were .
the bodyguard was shot in the shoulder and his gun was taken as he was buying pots of flowers by the side of the road , mohamed said .
last month , the chief justice said judges have received repeated threats since the supreme court nullified president uhuru kenyatta s win in the aug. 8 polls and ordered a fresh election .
