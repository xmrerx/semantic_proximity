UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday said that “Racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia” were “poisoning our societies,” after violence erupted between left- and right-wing groups in Virginia following a white supremacist rally on Saturday.
“We must stand up against them.
Every time.
Everywhere,” Guterres said in a Twitter post.
