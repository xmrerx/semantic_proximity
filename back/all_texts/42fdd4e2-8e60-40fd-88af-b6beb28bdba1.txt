Yuck!
It s bad enough that China had a dog meat festival last week but now this!
The USDA just removed the country of origin off of meat but it needs to come back ASAP!
If there s meat smuggling going on you really don t know where it originated, but if it s China I would like to make the informed choice not to buy their meat for this reason:Chinese authorities have seized more than 100,000 tonnes of smuggled meat some of it more than 40 years old, according to state media.The frozen meat, estimated to be worth about 300 million (3bn yuan; $483m), was seized in a nationwide crackdown.
It was smelly and I nearly threw up when I opened the door, an official from Hunan province, where 800 tonnes were seized, told the AFP news agency.
Poor standards have made food safety a major concern in China.
According to state newspaper the China Daily, officials from Guangxi, a southern region bordering Vietnam, found meat dating back to the 1970s.
Thawed several times Some of the meat seized in Hunan province was found to have been refrozen after thawing out while in transit, according to the reports.
Yang Bo, an anti-smuggling official in Hunan province, was quoted as saying food was often transported in ordinary rather than refrigerated vehicles to save money.
So the meat has often thawed out several times before reaching customers, he said.
The Hunan province haul reportedly included beef, chicken feet and duck necks.
Authorities believe meat is smuggled into China via neighbouring Hong Kong and Vietnam, from countries such as Brazil and India, to sidestep import restrictions.Read more: BBC
