February 12, is the 207th anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln s birth, and Twitter decided to celebrate it like only the social media giant can: with a hilarious hashtag.If you are an avid social networking user, then you have probably come across a quote attributed to President Lincoln or some other famous historical figure and thought, He definitely didn t say that.
It happens so often that it s an internet joke, just slap a quote next to someone notable s face and you have a viral internet meme shared by thousands (sometimes millions) of really stupid people.
President Lincoln is often the person in many of those memes, so Twitter users decided to celebrate his birthday with #ThingsLincolnDidntSay:I m excited for the future of my party.

It is true, he was a Republican, but if he were alive today there is absolutely no doubt that he d be considered a filthy liberal.The GOP is always trying to divide our country, especially the far-right anti-government Tea Party crazies.
President Lincoln, on the other hand, went to war to keep the country from splitting apart that s how much he loved the Union.
So it s pretty safe to say that he would not support the Confederate flag waving, Bundy militia supporting, Obama-hating Republican Party of 2016.
I will leave you with an actual quote from the sixteenth president, one that the right needs to remember: A house divided against itself cannot stand.
I believe this government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free.
I do not expect the Union to be dissolved I do not expect the house to fall but I do expect it will cease to be divided.
It will become all one thing or all the other.
Happy birthday, President Lincoln!
