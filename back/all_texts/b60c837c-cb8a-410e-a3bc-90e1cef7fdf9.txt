The latest video of Maxine Waters is downright hysterical!
She s confronted by one of her constituents who says they re going to work every day to make sure that President Trump isn t impeached and that Waters is impeached.
Mad Max didn t care for that comment and shot back: You can t impeach a woman of Congress Constituent: Well I just want to talk about your representation in Washington and our President as well.Waters: I can t stand him!
He s the most horrible man I ve ever seen in my life!
Constituent: I love my President.
Waters: I m glad you do!
Your President is a dishonorable, lying man.
He mocked a journalist.
I ve never seen a grown man do that!
He talked about grabbing women by the private parts.
He s lies everyday.
He s in bed with Putin and the Russians about oil!
And everybody around him are allies with the Kremlin and with the Oligarchs of Russia.
They re gonna take us down!
NEW: Constituent confronts Maxine Waters: I m going to work every day to make sure that [Trump] isn t impeached and that you re impeached.
