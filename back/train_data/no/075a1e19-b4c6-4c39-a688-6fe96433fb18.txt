milwaukee ( reuters ) - democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders are tussling in wisconsin over who would best represent the democratic party against republican front-runner donald trump .
the competition was in full force on saturday night at the wisconsin democratic party ’ s “ founders day gala , ” a chance for both cliinton and sanders to make their closing arguments before the state ’ s primary vote on tuesday .
clinton , as the democratic front-runner , is more and more taking aim at both trump and u.s .
senator ted cruz of texas , the top trump rival who is leading wisconsin polls of republican voters .
trump , in response to the threat of islamic militants , has proposed a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and cruz has called for police patrols of muslim neighborhoods .
clinton said these ideas are offensive .
“ that does not make trump and cruz sound strong , ” said clinton to the crowd of 1,400 .
“ it makes them sound in over their heads ... you know loose cannons tend to misfire , and in a dangerous world that is a gamble we can not afford. ” sanders , a u.s. senator from vermont who has been a surprisingly strong challenger to clinton for the democratic presidential nomination , told the crowd he would be a better opponent against trump than clinton .
sanders noted national poll numbers showing he leads trump by a larger margin than clinton leads the new york billionaire .
sanders said this makes him “ the strongest candidate ” on the democratic side to go up against trump .
“ it ’ s not just polling , ” sanders said .
“ there is one campaign which has created an enormous amount of excitement and enthusiasm and that is our campaign. ” for the democratic party to succeed in the nov. 8 election , sanders said , “ we need a vibrancy ” and energy that brings in young people who have flocked to his campaign .
