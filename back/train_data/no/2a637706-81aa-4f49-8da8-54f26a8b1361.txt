tokyo ( reuters ) - president donald trump discussed a possible free trade agreement ( fta ) with prime minister shinzo abe during his trip to tokyo , the u.s. ambassador to japan said on friday , contradicting japanese officials who had said such talks never took place .
japan has so far shown little interest in pursuing an fta with the united states , preferring instead to push for a modified version of the trans pacific partnership ( tpp ) after trump pulled his country from the pact .
on nov. 6 , deputy chief cabinet secretary yasutoshi nishimura told reporters trump had not mentioned an fta when he met abe for talks on relations between the two countries .
at a news conference in the japanese capital on friday , however , the u.s. envoy , william hagerty , said , they discussed a full range of trade options including an fta .
washington may push tokyo for an fta to help reduce what it sees as an unfair trading deficit with japan , hagerty added .
an fta is one of the tools we may need to address that , he said .
trump returned to washington this week after his first official visit to asia , a 12-day tour that started with a two-night stay in japan .
