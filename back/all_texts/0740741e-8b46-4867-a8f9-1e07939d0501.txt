Recently re-released footage from a 1988 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show gives insight into what Donald Trump really thinks of women.In the video, Trump appeared with his then-wife Ivana Trump and told Winfrey that We get along very well, and there s not a lot of disagreement because ultimately Ivana does exactly as I tell her to do.
Like many of Trump s predictions and investments over time, that marriage also ended up going bust.
He and Ivana divorced in 1991 after she found out he had been having an affair with Marla Maples, a former beauty queen.Trump then married Maples in 1993, and that marriage lasted until a breakup in 1997 and a divorce in 1999.
He married his current wife, former model Melania Knauss, in 2005.The comment hints at other sexist remarks and claims that Trump has made over the years.
These include:An ad from a Republican super PAC opposed to Trump compiled his sexist comments, and had every day women read them out loud to demonstrate how much of a turn off his candidacy might be in a general election.
The ad has so far received 3 million views on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkSRJSUY0vsPolls show Trump does have a problem with female voters.A CBS News/New York Times poll in October found that 57 percent of registered women voters had an unfavorable view of Trump.
Now, it s up to 63 percent.In a head-to-head match-up with Hillary Clinton, Trump trails 50 to 40 percent.
The reason is women, who give Clinton a whopping 20 point advantage over Trump 55 to 35 percent.Even when it has won presidential elections, Republicans have performed poorly with female voters.
The prospect of Trump s long paper trail of sexist comments, combined with the likelihood that the Democratic nominee will be a woman, could predict an epic electoral failure for the party.Featured image via YouTube
