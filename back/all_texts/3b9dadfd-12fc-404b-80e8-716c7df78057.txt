It s been pretty obvious for a long time now that Donald Trump has a rather large crush on his daughter Ivanka.
Even going so far as to say that if she wasn t his daughter he d be dating her.
It s gross to say the least, incestuous and disgusting to be perfectly honest.Well, now it s just been revealed that he thinks his daughter is a piece of ass and finds it perfectly acceptable for others to refer to her like that as well.In 2004, Trump appeared on the Howard Stern show yet again, and the subject of his daughter Ivanka came up.
He said: My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka Stern responds: By the way, your daughter Trump interupts: She s beautiful.
Stern asks: Can I say this?
A piece of ass Trump replies: Yeah.
Eewwwww.If Trump will talk about his own daughter like that, you know that he has absolutely zero respect for any and all women.
No self-respecting woman should ever vote for him.Listen to the audio here:How any woman could vote for Trump at this point is beyond me.
They either hate themselves or love being treated like a piece of meat.
