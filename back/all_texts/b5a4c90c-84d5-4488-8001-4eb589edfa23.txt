STUNNING!
Former US Pres.
Obama was at the International Summit of Food Innovation in Milan.
May 9.
2017 It s called SEEDS AND CHIPS but should be called THE BASICS OF COMMUNISM BY BARACK OBAMAYou might not want to listen to the entire video but it is truly stunning to listen to the elitist globalist vision for controlling the masses.
This is where we re heading if the people don t recognize this and rise up to fight it.
This is why the left hates Trump!
the shadow government wants control and will do everything it can to continue ruling.
Obama and his cronies are dangerous to us all.
We hope you ll listen to the entire video or at least the point beginning with 44:36:Please go to the 44:36 point of the video: Obama speaks and then notice the clapping after his comments these elitist lefties are nutso!OBAMA PRAISING THE INHERENT VALUE OF COMMUNISM: This is a much bigger concern in the economy as a whole.
And my guess is that ultimately what is going to happen is that everybody is going to have to work less and we re going to have to spread work more.But that is going to require a reorganization of the social compact.
That requires we change our mindset about the link between work, income and value of people in the teaching profession, or in healthcare, or in certain things that cannot be done by AI or a robot.How do we prepare for that?
And how do we start creating, or at least having a conversation within our society about making sure that work and opportunities are spread; and that everybody has the chance to live a good and fulfilling life?Rather than having a few people who are working 80 to 90 hours a week and making enormous incomes; and then a large portion of redundant workers that increasingly have difficult time supporting families.
That s not a sustainable mechanism for democracy and a healthy society.The end of the stunning comments is 46:40 of video
