21st century wire says the oroville dam in northern california has sustained sink hole damage in the main spillway and over 188,000 residents of the local area have been told to evacuate .
helicopters are dropping rocks into areas of erosion to try to prevent ground from eroding further downstream of the primary and the never before used secondary , passive spillways at the dam.abc10 noted late last week that the amount of water in the oroville dam is challenging the design of the dam ( due to the sink hole having formed in the spillway which required the outflow to be slowed ) with 185,000 cubic feet of water per second are coming into the dam and only 41,000 going out.there is a passive spillway that has now been forced into use as the water levels rise and more rain is expected later this week , but its unknown what the down stream effects will be as this auxiliary spillway has never been used before .
it has the potential of causing a lot of damage spilling downstream into the feather river and towards residential areas .
reports indicate they have increased the outgoing water from the main spillway to lessen the potential damage of the use of the passive spillway.join abc10 below for live updates and ongoing reports on this developing situation at the oroville dam abc 10at least 188,000 people living downstream of california s oroville dam were ordered to evacuate late sunday as officials said an emergency spillway was dangerously eroding and a failure could cause uncontrolled floodwaters to pour out of the lake.water began flowing over the emergency spillway at the oroville dam in northern california on saturday for the first time in its nearly 50-year history after heavy rainfall.evacuation orders still in place .
