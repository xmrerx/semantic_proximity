this brave man stood up to this ungrateful group of punks and did what every american should do when they encounter someone disrespecting our american flag.although none of the ucla students were willing to step in and help this disabled man with a can wrestle the american flag from these punks , they did ( surprisingly ) applaud his efforts.for the ultimate in hypocrisy , listen to the woman with the mega-phone at the 2:51 mark say obama says we are a nation of laws .
this country was founded on slavery .
the idiocy of this group hurts my head !
