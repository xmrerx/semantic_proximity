moscow/washington ( reuters ) - russia s defense ministry said on tuesday an employee had attached the wrong photos to a statement accusing the united states of providing de-facto air cover for islamic state in syria after the mistake was spotted online .
the ministry said it would investigate the incident , which it said was caused by a civilian employee , but did not say how or why the pictures used were incorrect .
however , the u.s. command s refusal to carry out strikes on the convoys of isil terrorists retreating from albu kamal on november 9 is an objective fact reflected in the transcripts of the talks and therefore , fully known to the u.s. side , interfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying on tuesday .
earlier on tuesday , the ministry posted a statement on its facebook page saying the u.s. air force had tried to hinder russian strikes on islamic state militants , accompanied by satellite photographs it said showed a vehicle convoy of islamic state militants leaving the syrian town of albu kamal on nov. 9 2017 .
at least one of the photographs exactly matched a frame from a promotional video for a ac-130 gunship simulator computer game posted online in march 2015 .
reuters was unable to reach the game s argentinian developed , byte conveyor studios , for comment .
asked about russian allegations of the u.s. helping islamic state around albu kamal , colonel ryan dillon , spokesman for the u.s.-led coalition fighting islamic state , said : the russian ministry of defense statements are about as accurate as their air campaign and i think that is a reason for them to start , you know , coming out with their latest barrage of lies .
i certainly can t verify , but i ve seen the report that one of the pictures came from a video game .
so , again that is pretty consistent with what we have seen come out of russian mod , as being baseless , inaccurate and you know , completely false , he told a briefing with pentagon reporters on tuesday .
