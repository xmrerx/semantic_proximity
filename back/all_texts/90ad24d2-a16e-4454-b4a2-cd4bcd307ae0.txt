The journalist, Jurgen Todenhofer (75), released his findings in a book called Inside IS Ten Days in the Islamic State, reports the UK s Daily Express on Friday.Todenhofer, who previously was an MP in German Chancellor Angela Merkel s CDU party before turning to journalism in 2000 as a war reporter, spent ten days with ISIS.He was overseen during his visit by Jihadi John, the ISIS terrorist from the UK named Mohammed Emwazi who gained fame in gruesome beheading videos.According to the journalist, the West is unprepared for ISIS.
He writes that the terrorists plan on killing several hundred million people.
The west is drastically underestimating the power of ISIS.
ISIS intends to get its hands on nuclear weapons, says Todenhofer, calling the group a nuclear tsunami preparing the largest religious cleansing in history.
Those warnings are made all the more stark by the possibility of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East sparked by the Iran nuclear deal, with rival states such as Saudi Arabia eyeing their own nuclear arsenal leading to a higher proliferation and a higher chance that nuclear weapons could fall into ISIS hands.
