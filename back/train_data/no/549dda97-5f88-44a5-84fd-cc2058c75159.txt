way before the election ever took place , the left had strapped on their battle gear and were preparing for the ultimate war against donald trump .
democrats , their media allies and george soros , chief financier of violent anti-trump protests , were all preparing for what they believed was the remote possibility trump would win the presidential election .
trump stunned the world when he pulled off a stunning victory against the anointed democrat candidate hillary clinton and now , the desperate left has been reduced to using character assassination of trump , his family , anyone in his administration and even his supporters as a means diminish his immense popularity with american voters.here s a sampling of the left , hard at work trying to destroy our new president : unfortunately , despite their best efforts , the left has been unable to turn americans against president trump and his new poll numbers are proving he s only becoming more popular as he continues to do what he promised during his campaign.today , rasmussen reports daily presidential tracking poll for monday , april 17 , shows that 50 % of likely u.s .
