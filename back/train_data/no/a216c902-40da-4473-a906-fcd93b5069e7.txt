belgrade ( reuters ) - four serbian men got suspended prison terms on tuesday for taking parts in riots at the u.s. embassy in 2008 - a long-delayed case that has soured relations between belgrade and washington .
the four were convicted of hurling stones at the embassy during protests over perceived u.s. support for kosovan independence .
they were not charged over a fire that broke out at the peak of the riots and destroyed part of the building .
washington has pressed for prosecutions for almost a decade , but no one has so far been convicted over the blaze which killed one protester .
the four - dejan vucckovic , dragan marinkov , marko novitovic and milan tomas - pleaded not guilty but were convicted of endangering public safety and given two-year suspended sentences .
the court ruling said the men s rocks broke windows in the embassy and other protesters later threw in flares that started the fire .
another three defendants were acquitted due to lack of evidence .
serbia s government and the protesters reacted with fury after kosovo s declaration of independence on feb 21 , 2008 .
serbia considers kosovo its historic heartland and has waged a diplomatic campaign against the secession of the predominantly ethnic albanian region .
belgrade lost control of kosovo in 1999 after nato bombing ended serbia s brutal counterinsurgency against albanians there .
defense lawyer zelimir cabrilo said the court s verdict had not addressed the political factors behind the riot .
it was a political decision to stage the rally ... to remove ( police ) security from the embassy , cabrilo told reporters .
instead , we have light , modest sentences against four persons ... for hurling stones , they were not sentenced for torching it ( the embassy ) .
the case was delayed last year when the serbian court of appeals annulled a lower court s sentencing , citing deficiencies in the ruling , and ordered a retrial .
