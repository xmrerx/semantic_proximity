A kind woman brought Fox News reporter Casey Stegall a beer on Friday as he was reporting live in the midst of Hurricane Harvey.
With rain and wind pouring down, Stegall was reporting on site in Galveston, Texas.
A woman ran over to him and his crew and handed the reporter a six-pack.
Have some Galveston beer!
she yelled to Stegall.Stegall thanked the woman, who ran off.
He said that the beer would be enjoyed after the broadcast.
Just friendly people here, he said.
However, Stegall and his crew had bigger issues to worry about.
I just want to say, my producer and everyone off camera is telling me that a tornado warning has just been issued for the Galveston area, he said.Fox host Harris Faulkner wrapped up the broadcast, telling Stegall, you gotta get out of there.
