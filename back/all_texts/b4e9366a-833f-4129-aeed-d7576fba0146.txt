Donald Trump could end up behind bars if the state of Virginia holds him in contempt of court for violating a federal court order that halted parts of his Muslim ban.Last Friday, Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people from seven countries from entering the United States.
Worldwide chaos and mass protests ensued throughout the weekend as Custom s officials and airport security detained and deported people traveling from those nations, even going so far as to detain American citizens who have green cards and separating children from their parents.Multiple states and the ACLU immediately filed lawsuits against the order and attorneys rushed to defend the rights of those being detained.And then New York federal Judge Ann M. Donnelly issued a stay that was supposed to immediately halt the actions of Custom s officials and airport security.Shortly after that, a federal court in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order to force Customs agents to let lawyers talk to legal United States residents who were being detained.But Customs officials ignored the order in directly defied the court ruling, and now the state of Virginia is pursuing charges against Trump for it.A motion has been filed requesting the issuance of a rule to show cause why respondents should not be held in contempt of this Court s temporary restraining order (TRO) entered on the evening of January 28, 2017.
Donald Trump is specifically named in the motion along with the Department of Homeland Security and several Customs officials.United States Congressman Donald Beyer filed a declaration under penalty of perjury that he personally witnessed Customs agents ignore the federal court order and said that police at Dulles International Airport blocked him and two of his colleagues from speaking to the Customs official in charge because they were ordered to not let anyone have access to them.
Senator Cory Booker also filed a declaration in support of the motion.Now a hearing will be held to determine if Trump ordered the Customs agents at Dulles to ignore the court order, and if he did, he will likely be charged with contempt of court, which carries a possible jail sentence.Homeland Security even admitted that it was ignoring the court order to continue enforcing Trump s executive order.The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trump s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people.
President Trump s Executive Orders remain in place prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety.
President Trump s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America s borders and national security.The fact that Customs agents willfully ignored a federal court to continue carrying out Trump s tyrannical order is absolutely frightening.
The question is, did Homeland Security willfully ignore the court order by itself, or did Trump order them to ignore it and his order was passed down the chain of command to the Customs officials?
If the order can be traced to Trump, he is in violation of a court order and should be punished for it.
And if that means prison time, then so be it.
Because unlike the presidency, Trump is totally qualified to be a prison inmate.Featured image via Capitol Hill Blue
