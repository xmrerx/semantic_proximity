brussels ( reuters ) - the european union agreed on wednesday to extend for another six months its blacklist of 149 russian nationals and ukrainian separatists , as well as 38 entities , for their role in the turmoil in ukraine , sources in brussels said .
during a weekly meeting in brussels , representatives of the 28 eu states agreed on the roll over , which will formally be adopted on sept. 14 , and prolong the visa ban and asset freeze list until mid-march .
the bloc first imposed sanctions on russia after it annexed the black sea peninsula of crimea from kiev in march 2014 , and ratcheted them up as moscow went on to back a separatist revolt in the east of the former soviet republic .
russia vows to never return crimea though the annexation has not been internationally recognized and is denounced as illegal .
the conflict in east ukraine has killed more than 10,000 people and is still simmering , a key factor souring russia s relations with the west , including the eu .
the bloc s separate main economic sanctions against russia , which curb eu cooperation in the energy , defense and financial fields , are in place until the end of january 2018 .
apart from separatist leaders in crimea and east ukraine , the eu s blacklist , which prevents people getting visas or freezes their assets , includes senior russian officials and companies that have supported or benefited from the crisis .
