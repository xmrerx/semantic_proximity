it s nice to see freedom of speech is alive and well in the godless party of america maybe barack and the dem s should listen to what kanye has to say .
after all , it appears after years of behaving like a vapid rapper , he s taken a liking to dr. ben carson and his message to america : as soon as i heard carson speak , i tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him .
i was like , this is the most brilliant guy .
but then again .that s likely the reason the dem s don t want kanye to speak if the democrat party attempts to silence a popular black entertainer who supports a 100 % black man for president ( who grew up in the ghettos of detroit ) shouldn t americans be a bit concerned about blatant discrimination ? kanye west , who says he s plotting his own 2020 presidential bid , will perform at a democratic national committee fundraiser in san francisco attended by president obama on oct. 10.but don t expect west to unleash one of his rants : he ll be required to stick to performance only.a source said , there will be restrictions .
.
.
kanye won t be able to lecture the president about how to run the country .
west will debut songs from his next album , swish , at the event , for which tickets cost up to $ 10,000.dnc member robert zimmerman quipped , kanye will be an exciting draw , especially compared to the republicans booking wayne newton or clint eastwood .
we all know how well that turned out .
