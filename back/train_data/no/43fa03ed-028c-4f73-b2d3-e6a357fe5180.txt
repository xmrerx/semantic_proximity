gothenburg , sweden ( reuters ) - there is no deadlock in divorce talks between britain and the european union , eu summit chair donald tusk said on friday , adding he was very cautious , but optimistic that negotiations could move on to the next phase in december .
the eu wants to have the main elements of a divorce agreement with britain on the financial settlement , citizen s rights and the lack of a physical border between northern ireland and ireland before it moves on to talks on a future trade agreement which is key for british-based businesses .
so far progress in the three areas has been insufficient , raising the prospect that divorce talks will drag on to next year without starting discussions on a future relationship , as companies need to make strategic business decisions now .
there is no deadlock , tusk told reporters on the sidelines of an eu leaders meeting in the swedish city of gothenburg where he also held talks with british prime minister theresa may .
i feel much better , safer after my meeting with theresa may , everything is possible , tusk said .
there was very visibly goodwill on both sides .
we still have a chance to achieve our first goal to achieve the finalization of the first phase of negotiations .
i am very cautious , but optimistic .
he said he will meet may again next friday , nov. 24 , to consult on progress during another eu meeting in brussels .
