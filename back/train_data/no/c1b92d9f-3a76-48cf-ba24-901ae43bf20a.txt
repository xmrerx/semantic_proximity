athens ( reuters ) - greece must speed up winter preparations at refugee camps on islands in the aegean sea where there has been a sharp rise in arrivals , the united nations refugee agency said on friday .
nearly 5,000 refugees , mostly syrian or iraqi families , crossed from turkey in september - a quarter of all arrivals this year , unhcr data shows .
while that is a fraction of the nearly 1 million who arrived in 2015 - due to a european union deal with turkey to block that route - four of the five island camps are hosting two or three times as many people as they were designed for .
unhcr urges action on the islands to ease overcrowding , improve shelter , and stock and distribute appropriate and sufficient aid items , said philippe leclerc , unhcr representative in greece .
in the moria camp on the island of lesbos , one of the main entry points , more than 1,500 people are in makeshift shelters or tents without insulation , flooring or heating , unhcr said .
they include pregnant women , people with disabilities , and very young children .
on nearby samos , about 400 people are living in very difficult conditions and another 300 , including families and lone children , are sleeping in tents in the woods due to a lack of space in the camp , unhcr said .
more than 3,000 people on samos are crammed into facilities designed to hold 700 .
in january , refugees in greece suffered sub-zero temperatures when an icy spell gripped parts of the country and scores of summer tents were weighed down by snow .
more than 60,000 refugees and migrants have been trapped in greece since balkan countries along the northward overland route to western europe sealed their borders in march 2016 .
unhcr has been gradually reducing its involvement on the islands since national institutions took over most services in august .
