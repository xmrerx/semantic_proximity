Donald Trump is winning states and if his momentum continues, he will be the Republican nominee for the presidency of the United States.
That statement is hard to write, harder to say, and the idea of Trump becoming the most powerful man in the world is the hardest to fathom.
That s because Trump is textbook demagogy at its finest and he is decisive and narcissistic.Trump doesn t want to be president to help America.
Proof for that statement is the fact that his call for violence, his racism, and his divisive nature have already hurt America.
Rather, Trump wants to be president so he can be called president.Mark Fiore sums up Trump s demagogy very well in his new cartoon.
He said: I m not saying he s Hitler or anything, but there is definitely something chilling about his cadence, his toying with demagoguery and longing for the days when we could sic the dogs on protestors and be done with these unseemly interruptions.
This used to be funny but is now getting a little too close for comfort.
(Although tactically, this may be the best thing for a more reasonable alternative because people in the United States would never vote for this guy for real, right?
Right?)
After watching this cartoon, one can t help but be puzzled at how this individual, who does not seem bright by any stretch of the imagination, and is clearly dangerous, has a shot at the most powerful position on earth.
It s a frightening prospect.
That s why it s so important to vote in November.Here s the video: [vimeo 159170550 w=500 h=281] Featured image via video screenshot.
