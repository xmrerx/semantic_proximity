It s time to get absolutely real about something the Republican party, in all legitimacy, has absolutely no one serious to run for president.
While the Democrats are sitting with two extremely competent and viable choices, either of which would be great, the Republicans are left with the side-show of circus that isn t even capable of selling tickets.
Let s be real no one wants them.
They re all nincompoops.
People are just voting for them because, A.)
they re nincompoops too, or B.)
they just don t know what else to do.Here you have these men, vying for the most coveted position in all the world, and we d be lucky if we could even witness them tie their own shoe laces.
They argue with each other like pre-schoolers fighting over toys in the sandbox.
Trump even called Cruz a basket case.
Which sure, he is, but that is neither here nor there.
Watching these men go at it is no better than watching a cockfight.
You re literally waiting for them to just whip it out and lay it on the table to measure.
That s sincerely what it looks as though it s come to.And if you need further proof, just watch here:// < !
