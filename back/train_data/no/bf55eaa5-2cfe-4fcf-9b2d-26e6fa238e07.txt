seoul ( reuters ) - north korea denounced on wednesday u.s. president donald trump s decision to relist it as a state sponsor of terrorism , calling it a serious provocation and violent infringement , north korean state media reported .
trump put north korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism on monday , a designation that allows the united states to impose more sanctions and risks inflaming tension over north korea s nuclear weapons and missile programs .
in north korea s first reaction to the designation , a spokesman for the foreign ministry denied in an interview with the state media outlet kcna , that his government engaged in any terrorism .
he called the state sponsor of terrorism label just a tool for american style authoritarianism that can be attached or removed at any time in accordance with its interests .
the u.s. designation only made north korea more committed to retaining its nuclear arsenal , the official said .
as long as the u.s. continues with its anti-dprk hostile policy , our deterrence will be further strengthened , he said , referring to north korea by the initials of its official name , the democratic people s republic of korea .
the u.s. will be held entirely accountable for all the consequences to be entailed by its impudent provocation to the dprk .
the designation came a week after trump returned from a 12-day , five-nation trip to asia in which he made containing north korea s nuclear ambitions a centerpiece of his discussions .
announcing the designation , trump told reporters at the white house : in addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation , north korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism , including assassinations on foreign soil .
