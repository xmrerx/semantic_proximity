Donald Trump s presidential campaign is spiraling out of control.
Reeling from days and days of missteps by the nominee following the Democratic Convention, the campaign has been a steady stream of bizarre behavior and comments.And it isn t just the nominee who is making bizarre statements and accusations.Katrina Pierson, the national spokeswoman for Trump s presidential campaign, appeared on CNN s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.
During the appearance, they discussed Trump s ongoing smear campaign attacking the family of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan.Watch: Katrina Pierson blames Obama and Clinton for Kahn losing his life in interview with Wolf Blizter.

He had not even given his famous Two Americas speech, which took place at the 2004 Democratic Convention on July 27, 2004.
He had no power or influence over the rules of engagement on any battlefield the United States was involved in.The only way for any of that scenario as described by Trump s official spokesperson was for Obama to be in possession of a time machine, or through the use of magic or some kind of super power.The statement from the Trump campaign s official spokesperson comes on the same day where Trump held in a rally in which he insulted multiple American cities, said he hoped for an economic collapse to happen before he is elected so he won t be blamed, and yelled at two parents with crying babies.Later in the day, Trump gave an interview in which he promoted the primary challenger to Speaker Paul Ryan, said he was not ready to endorse Ryan, and attacked Senator Kelly Ayotte, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire.All of these events happened on a single day.Featured image via Twitter
