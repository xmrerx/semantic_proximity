just yesterday , amateur president donald trump made an ass out of himself by failing at history , and today , he s calling for a future government shutdown .
only trump could f * ck up the past and the future , all in 24-hours .
trump wants to shut down the very government he s leading , which is a thing a real president would try to avoid .
former president barack obama made concessions in order to avoid a government shutdown , but the man-baby potus is whining on twitter over the deal which was reached on a $ 1 trillion-plus bill to fund the government for the final five months of this fiscal year.even though republicans control congress , the senate and they have installed a republican president , trump did not get funding for his ineffective border wall , taxpayer dollars will not be spent on a deportation force , the bill includes $ 295 million for puerto rico s medicaid program and congress budget will not defund planned parenthood .
and that s just the short list.obviously , this has upset the former reality show star , who previously deemed himself to be a great negotiator.on twitter , he wrote , the reason for the plan negotiated between the republicans and democrats is that we need 60 votes in the senate which are not there !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) may 2 , 2017a few minutes later , trump added , either elect more republican senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51 % .
our country needs a good shutdown in september to fix mess !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) may 2 , 2017so , if he doesn t get his way he wants to change the rules .
there s a reason the prospect of a government shutdown is hugely unpopular , so one twitter user schooled him .
@ realdonaldtrump you 're reckless .
shutting down the government is n't like closing a casino .
the last government shutdown cost the economy ~ $ 24b/0.6 % gdp .
joseph amodeo ( @ josephamodeo ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump 2013 shutdown also resulted in $ 450k/day in lost revenue from @ natlparkservice ( source : nps and wapo ) .
joseph amodeo ( @ josephamodeo ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump @ natlparkservice and according to @ ustravel , the 2013 shutdown cost $ 152m/day ( $ 2.4b ) in `` lost travel spending '' ( source : u.s. travel assoc and wapo ) .
joseph amodeo ( @ josephamodeo ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump @ natlparkservice @ ustravel @ realdonaldtrump , if the government does in fact shutdown , it means you did n't do your job .
the american ppl can not afford a shutdown joseph amodeo ( @ josephamodeo ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump @ natlparkservice @ ustravel and while we 're at it : we can not afford an increase in gas tax .
these consumption taxes disproportionately affect low/middle income ppl .
joseph amodeo ( @ josephamodeo ) may 2 , 2017it s true that trump is literally calling for an increase in gas tax .
we remember when conservatives blamed obama for gas price increases when that was not in his control , but now a republican president wants to deliberately raise the price of gas through a tax increase.twitter users were not amused by trump s reckless tweet .
@ realdonaldtrump wait .
you put `` shutdown '' is quotes so according to sean spicer , you do n't really mean it .
david nuzzy nussbaum ( @ thenuzzy ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump maybe attempt to be a president for all the people and reach across the aisle for a bipartisan agreement like every president before you .
david nuzzy nussbaum ( @ thenuzzy ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump last week you were blaming democrats for shutting down the government jail donald trump ( @ dtrumpexposed ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump you sound like a toddler throwing his trucks ( we know you like them ) out of his playpen because other kids are being mean .
grown the fuck up mike p williams ( @ mike_p_williams ) may 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump well , now you 're at least being consistent with your earlier , positive views on government shutdowns https : //t.co/07wlkur1cs simon hedlin ( @ simonhedlin ) may 2 , 2017trump is more unpopular than any other president during their first 100 days in office .
i wonder what he s trying to distract us from this time ( cough , cough , russia ) .photo by chip somodevilla/getty images
