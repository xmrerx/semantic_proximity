9-year-old Charlotte, North Carolina girl Zianna Oliphant is already tired in her very short life of seeing black men and women die at the hands of police officers.Oliphant spoke about her fears at a meeting of the Charlotte City Council and it was heartbreaking.
[ad3media campaign= 941 ]Zianna and her brother, Marquis, both spoke at a City Council meeting in which members of the city s black community called for changes after police fatally shot an African-American man, Keith Lamont Scott, last week.Police say Scott was armed.
The shooting death and questions over the use of deadly police force against people of color sparked protests that roiled the city.
We are black people and we shouldn t have to feel like this.
We shouldn t have to protest because y all are treating us wrong, the girl said Monday.
We do this because we need to and have rights.
In a later interview with NBC, Oliphant said the emotion of the issue hit her as she spoke, and that s why she began crying.Her mother, Precious Oliphant, pointed out that Zianna and Marquis are involved in a police youth league and have frequently been around police officers in a positive fashion.
But they are still aware of the problems of discrimination and racism at a very young age because as their mother she has been frequently pulled over for police for what she believes are trivial issues, like the way she wore her hair.Zianna says she plans to become a doctor when she grows up, and speaking up as she did, she is obviously well on her way to being a community leader.
Others around her and in positions of leadership and authority in her community could do far worse than to follow her example, as she is clearly wise beyond her actual years.Featured image via screen capture
