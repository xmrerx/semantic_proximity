athens ( reuters ) - greek police found bomb-making equipment and detonators in raids in athens on tuesday and were questioning nine people over suspected links to a banned militant group in turkey ahead of an expected visit by turkish president tayyip erdogan next week .
eight men and a woman thought to hold turkish citizenship were being detained after morning raids at three different addresses in central athens .
they were expected to appear before an investigating magistrate on wednesday .
earlier , police officials told reuters the individuals were being quizzed for alleged links to the leftist militant dhkp/c , an outlawed group blamed for a string of attacks and suicide bombings in turkey since 1990 .
at three homes , police found materials available commercially which could potentially be used in making explosives , they said in a statement .
they also retrieved digital material , travel documents and a pistol .
one of the detainees had been wanted by greek police in connection with an arms and explosives haul off the greek island of chios , close to the turkish coast , in 2013 .
witnesses saw police experts in hazmat suits and holding suitcases entering one address in athens .
tests on an unknown substance found in jars were expected to be concluded within the day .
turkey s erdogan is widely expected to visit greece in december , although his visit has not been officially announced .
it would be the first visit by a turkish president in more than 50 years .
another official told the semi-official athens news agency that the case was unconnected to domestic terror groups or militant islamists , and described those questioned as being of turkish origin .
dhkp/c , known also as the revolutionary people s liberation party/front , is considered a terrorist group by the european union , turkey and the united states .
