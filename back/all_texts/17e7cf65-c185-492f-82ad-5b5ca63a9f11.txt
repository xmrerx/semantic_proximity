Right-wing actor James Woods is so upset that a liberal made fun of him on Twitter that he is suing for $10 million dollars.
Woods, who has been in Hollywood for several decades, is part of a secretive Hollywood club of conservatives called Friends of Abe.A Twitter user, who goes by the name of Abe List has been sued by Woods, after he called the actor a cocaine addict.
Woods is now attempting to uncover the true identity of the Twitter user and get an award of damages for the tweet.The spat began when Mr Woods posted on Twitter about a row between Bruce Jenner and Planned Parenthood.He wrote: USATODAY app features Bruce Jenner s latest dress selection but makes zero mention of Planned Parenthood baby parts market.
Abe List replied: Cocaine addict James Woods still sniffing and spouting.
He also referred to Mr Woods as a joke and a ridiculous scum clown-boy .Woods often uses his account to post attacks and smears against President Obama and other liberals (he called Al Sharpton a pimp ).
In his lawsuit, Woods whines that Abe List is a cowardly individual who was the mastermind of a malicious online campaign to discredit the actor.In response Lisa Bloom, who is a lawyer representing Abe List, has pointed out that suggestions that Mr Woods was on drugs was not meant to be taken literally.
While Hollywood obviously leans heavily to the left, there are of course conservatives in that industry like there are everywhere else.
Yet, it is an article of faith that Hollywood conservatives are somehow frozen out from opportunities in the industry, which helped lead to the creation of the Friends of Abe group.
Deceased right-wing provocateur Andrew Breitbart was among the founders of the group, along with Gary Sinise, Kelsey Grammer, Lionel Chetwynd, Jon Voight.
They hosted Donald Trump for a get together in July of 2015.While Woods is not an A-list actor, he has steadily worked in Hollywood, and recently appeared in the TV series Ray Donovan and in the movie White House Down, hardly the resume of someone being persecuted for his conservative beliefs.Ever the victim.Featured image via YouTube
