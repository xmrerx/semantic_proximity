harare ( reuters ) - a zimbabwean court on tuesday freed activist pastor evan mawarire , a critic of president robert mugabe , following his weekend arrest on new charges of attempting to subvert the government .
it was the second time he has been detained for a similar offense .
mawarire went on trial on monday on separate subversion charges stemming from protests last year against mugabe s handling of the economy .
the magistrates court said the rights of mawarire , who appeared in khaki prison uniform , had been violated after police failed to bring him to court within 48 hours following his arrest on sunday morning , as stipulated by the law .
mawarire had earlier attended trial at the high court but the judge postponed the case to thursday .
the 40-year-old pastor faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted , and even if acquitted could soon be on trial again .
he is due to face yet another trial at a later date on charges of promoting violence after he addressed protesting university students in june .
