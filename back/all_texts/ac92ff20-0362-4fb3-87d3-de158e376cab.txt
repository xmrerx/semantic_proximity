The nationwide depression among democrats, specifically Hillary supporters, has not declined much since the initial election day devastation occurred.They have now come up with a name for their plight, they re calling it Post-Election Stress Disorder.
The title is a nod toward the condition that many returning veterans experience, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.PTSD is a serious disorder, it is believed to be responsible for suicides in a large number of active duty military and veterans.
Every day, 22 veterans take their own lives.
That s a suicide every 65 minutes.
As shocking as the number is, it may actually be higher.
*Some veterans are taking exception, with good reason, to liberals even insinuating that their disappointment over Hillary Clinton losing an election comes close to what is experienced on the battlefield.
