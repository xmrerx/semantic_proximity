vienna ( reuters ) - austria s co-governing social democrats ( spo ) and conservative ( ovp ) , who are leading in polls ahead of the oct. 15 election , said on friday they would sue each other in an escalating political smear scandal .
a public outcry over derogatory facebook pages targeting ovp leader sebastian kurz , run by campaign consultants hired by the spo , has already led to the departure of its campaign manager and loss of popularity in a recent poll .
the limit has been reached .
we re suing , ovp general secretary elisabeth koestinger told a news conference .
she said her party was preparing a libel suit against an employee of spo campaign consultant tal silberstein , whom the spo fired in august , to force him to retract comments that the ovp had offered him 100,000 euros ( $ 116,980 ) to switch sides .
we are also preparing to sue the spo in relation to incitement , she said , adding the lawsuit could be broadened .
spo chairman christoph matznetter said the spo was preparing a lawsuit against kurz s spokesman seeking to clarify whether he did or did not offer money to silberstein s employee .
he said such an act could amount to bribery and industrial espionage .
spo chancellor christian kern , who has governed in a tension-ridden grand coalition with the ovp , has said he knew nothing of the dirty campaigning pages and has asked facebook to unmask the people running them .
at the behest of the spo , vienna prosecutors are investigating unnamed persons for defamation as the pages also included derogatory content aimed at kern .
the ovp is leading pre-election polls at around 34 percent , while the spo has slipped to third place at 22 percent below the far-right , anti-immigrant freedom party at 27 percent .
