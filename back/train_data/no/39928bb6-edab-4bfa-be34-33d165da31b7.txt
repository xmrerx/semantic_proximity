just a reminder of something michelle obama said in 2008 on the campaign trail in puerto rico : michelle obama : barack knows that we are going to have to make sacrifices ; we are going to have to change our conversation ; we re going to have to change our traditions , our history ; we re going to have to move into a different place as a nation .
change our traditions and change our history .
what did she mean by that ? changing history means not just telling the same old tall tales of the free market system and the founders .
no , it s the history according to progressives .
and it s not merely spinning the old facts ; it s taking current events and molding them to fit the progressive agenda and , in this case , completely ignoring history .
the obama s racism can t be denied and fortunately thanks to videos , it can t be hidden either :
