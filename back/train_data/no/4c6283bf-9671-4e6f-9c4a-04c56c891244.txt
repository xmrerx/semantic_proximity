london ( reuters ) - wayde van niekerk duly qualified for the world championship 400 meters final on sunday but the defending champion and world record holder looks to have a real battle on his hands after some searing semi-final performances .
the south african was desperately trying to conserve energy as he bids for a 200/400m double but was forced to go deeper than he would have liked by botswana ’ s baboloki thebe in the second of three semi-finals , eventually clocking 44.22 seconds .
by that stage two 21-year-olds had fired out a warning with massive personal bests .
steven gardiner improved his own bahamas national record and went under 44 seconds for the first time , clocking a 43.89 which he might pay for in the final on tuesday .
nathon allen also set a jamaican record , taking almost half a second off his best with 44.19 .
botswana ’ s isaac makwala looked very comfortable in winning his heat in 44.22 seconds .
van niekerk was originally drawn in the opening heat but organizers changed the lineup , which pleased the south african .
“ whoever changed it , thank you , i wasn ’ t ready for 43 seconds , ” he said .
“ it seems like every time we go on the track someone breaks 44 seconds .
it is good competition but it just means i always have to be on my game .
“ i ’ m just trying to get through the rounds as conservatively as i can. ” american ’ s big hope fred kerley scraped into the final as a fast loser but former olympic and world champion lashawn merritt , another man to serve a doping ban though unlike compatriot justin gatlin loudly cheered by the london crowd , failed to make it .
