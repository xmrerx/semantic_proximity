LONDON (Reuters) - A teenager who moved to Britain after his parents were killed in Iraq will go on trial in March over a bomb attack on a packed commuter train that injured 30 people in London in September.
Ahmed Hassan, 18, is accused of intent to kill and cause serious injury by planting a home-made bomb at Parsons Green station in London.
The bomb shot flames through a carriage but failed to fully explode.
Hassan appeared via video link at London s Central Criminal Court on Friday where a judge said a two week trial would start on March 5.
He is set to appear in court next on Jan. 19.
