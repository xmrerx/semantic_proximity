Trump took some time today during a White House meeting with Republican congressional leaders to brag about his new ideas for the border wall.
According to three meeting attendees, Trump proposed that the wall could be covered with solar panels, and pay for the cost of the wall with the electricity it generated.Trump was happy about his idea of a wall that was up to 50 feet high and solar panel covered.
He bragged that they would be beautiful structures, because most walls are only 14 or 15 feet high, and these ones would be taller and better.Trump did have one caveat going forward with solar panel border wall discussion he insisted that lawmakers could talk about it as long as they told everyone it was his idea!
The truth is, obviously, it wasn t. But remember, we have a toddler for a President.A solar panel covered wall was actually proposed in a bid submitted during a U.S. requests for wall designs at the beginning of the year, according to a report by the AP.
The companies who get the contracts will likely be announced later this month.This begs the question can we use the President s toddler tendencies for the good of the planet?
Maybe all we need to do to get Trump to support renewable energy is to give him credit for coming up with it and give him extra praise like a three-year-old who ate his vegetables.
