It s no secret Republicans are salivating to find something, anything, to take down Hillary Clinton.
The idea of a third term for Democrats (at the hands of an accomplished woman) scares the hell out of them.
So they do what they do best: lie, cheat, smear and bog down with endless investigations.Now that the FBI and the Department of Justice have cleared Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing, Republicans are once again faced with nowhere to go.
They have hit a wall when it comes to pinning criminal charges on Clinton, who is increasing her chances of becoming America s next president.As part of a usual maneuver of transparency, the FBI handed over to members of Congress documents detailing witness interview reports, including that of Secretary Clinton s interview, along with other materials from the FBI s now closed investigative file in regards to her email controversy.In the age of the internet, it is almost guaranteed that whenever Congress gets their hands on anything potentially incriminating, embarrassing or politically expedient, it s leaked to the public.
Both sides do it for different reasons, some for nefarious reasons, and others as a public service.But this situation is different.
Republicans are hoping to use evidence in these documents as a smoking gun for the court of public opinion since their desire for indictment in a court of law fell flat.
But there s one harbinger to this: many of these documents are deemed classified and confidential.
And should any Republican, at the behest of their staff or them personally, feel compelled to leak the information provided, the FBI released a statement reminding them of what they are messing with:Consistent with our commitment to transparency with respect to the FBI s investigation to former Secretary of State Clinton s use of a personal server, the FBI is providing certain relevant materials to appropriate congressional committees assist them in their oversight responsibilities in this matter.
The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence.Should someone from Capitol Hill leak the information, prosecution could be pursued.
And should a Republican be stupid enough to allow such a leak, their moral high ground argument that Clinton was reckless with handling classified information would be completely and utterly decimated.While Republicans are hoping to be selective in their discoveries, the Clinton campaign has announced that they want all the documents pertaining to the investigation to be released, as to stave off biased selection of information at the hands of a bloodthirsty GOP:This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI.
We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.While Trump continues to put off releasing his much anticipated tax returns, the Clinton campaign is calling for near-total transparency of the facts surrounding what is arguably the dumbest scandal she has been linked to.Be careful Republicans.
Everything you ve worked for could come crashing down should a giddy staffer decide to be a conservative hero and leak information.Featured image via Mark Mekela/Getty Images
