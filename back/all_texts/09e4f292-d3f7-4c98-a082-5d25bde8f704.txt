Such a compassionate faith Bring an 8-year old girl in for a clitorectomy and watch how quickly they sharpen the knives A Pakistani sewer worker died Thursday after doctors refused to treat him due to the fact he was unclean.
Irfan Masih, 30, went unconscious while cleaning a manhole in the city of Umerkot.
He was taken to the hospital where he suffocated to death in front of doctors who refused to treat him because he was covered in sewer sludge.
The doctors refused to treat him because they were fasting and said my son was napaak (unclean), Irshad Masih, the sewer worker s mother, told Pakistan s Express Tribune.Muslims across the world are currently observing the holy month of Ramadan, which requires them to abstain from eating, drinking and sex during daylight hours, but treating the worker does not appear to fall under these rules.
Muslim medical professionals across the world frequently work with patients in all sorts of conditions during the holy month.
