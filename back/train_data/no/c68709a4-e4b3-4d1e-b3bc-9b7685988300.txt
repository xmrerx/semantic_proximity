mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico recognized honduran president juan orlando hernandez on tuesday as the winner of last month s election , just days after the organization of american states called for a fresh vote to dispel widespread allegations of fraud .
the statement by mexico , an important player in central america , strengthened the position of hernandez , who declared himself president-elect on tuesday .
it could pave the way for more countries , including the united states , to weigh in the incumbent s favor .
mexico respectfully calls for the democratic institutions , the political forces and the people of honduras , in a mark of respect and agreement , to definitively conclude this electoral process , the foreign ministry said in a statement .
mexico s announcement was brokered in coordination with the united states , two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said .
the presidents of guatemala and colombia had recognized hernandez , a staunch u.s. ally .
the mexican foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
the statement was requested by foreign minister luis videgaray , one of the sources said .
honduras ambassador in mexico was alerted of the move on monday .
the embassy did not immediately respond to request for comment .
it is likely to enrage the center-left opposition , led by tv star salvador nasralla , who has accused hernandez of stealing the election , sparking violent nationwide protests .
the general secretariat of the oas on sunday said the election was plagued with irregularities and should be redone to meet democratic standards .
