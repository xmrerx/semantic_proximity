Unless you count online polls that Trump fans voted in multiple times to make it appear as if he won Monday s presidential debate, Donald Trump actually lost.
Most pundits feel he lost, as did the focus groups used by several of the networks, as did scientific polls that were taken of people who watched the event.
He lost, handily.Trump lost so badly that even his allies who want to see him elected President have been complaining to the media about his limp performance.
And that has made Trump very very angry.In a conference call with surrogates Wednesday afternoon, Trump aides made clear the Republican nominee is upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before his next bout with Hillary Clinton.
And he wants them to stop it immediately.The message was not subtle, a source familiar with the call said.Trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didn t nail it.In the world of Trump and his ego, admitting that you lost a battle is the worst thing, possibly even worse than actually losing the battle itself.
For someone like Trump, who fancies himself an alpha male, an admission of humility or defeat is the worst possible scenario.
In his eyes, anyone conceding that he underperformed is unacceptable, and even worse if you re in the Trump orbit.That is why Trump almost completely limits himself to media appearances on Fox News, where he won t ever seriously be challenged on even the most bizarre and untrue claims he makes in the campaign.
Trump is inside a bubble, only speaking to those who agree with him and who want to suck up to him.
He is being told time and time again by his hangers-on that he is doing everything just right.
And he won t tolerate anybody who allows reality to intrude.Featured image via Flickr
