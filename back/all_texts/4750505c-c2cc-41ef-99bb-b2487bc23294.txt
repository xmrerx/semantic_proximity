Donald Trump isn t used to being criticized, and now that he s weeks away from assuming the presidency the criticism is going to intensify to a level he s never seen before.
And he can t handle it.That manifested itself again in another incident where Trump had the writer of an unflattering biography kicked off of his golf course.President-elect Donald Trump on Friday ejected from his West Palm Beach golf course one of his most critical biographers, Harry Hurt III, who had been preparing to play in a foursome with billionaire mega-donor David Koch.Hurt is the author of Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, a 1993 book that revealed among other things that Trump was accused of rape by his ex-wife Ivana Trump in a sworn deposition during their divorce proceedings.Hunt approached Trump on the golf course and congratulated him on the election win.
In response, witnesses say Trump blasted Hunt over the content of his book.
He then told Hunt, you re out of here and he was then removed from the course.Trump was golfing with David Koch, of the infamous right wing Koch Brothers but who did not support Trump in the 2016 election.
Koch reportedly said he was appalled by Trump s petty behavior on the golf course.Hunt was previously forced to retract the claim of sexual assault in his Trump book after legal threats.Trump has shown a petty and vindictive streak towards detractors and others who have reported on him in an unflattering light before.
It remains to be seen what he will do with the full power of the presidency behind him, and how he will utilize that power and the agencies beneath him to go after his perceived enemies.On the other hand, detractors will have the widest audience they ve ever had for Trump stories.Featured image via YouTube
