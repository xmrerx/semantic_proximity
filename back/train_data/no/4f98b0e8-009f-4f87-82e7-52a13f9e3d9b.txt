msnbc anchor joe scarborough was caught on a hot mic making a snarky suggestion that president donald trump is not a christian , just as morning joe went to a commercial break .
after spending much of the show criticizing trump s proposed budget , the show went to a commercial break .
mika brzezinski said that after the break they would discuss trump s visit with the pope : coming up , they didn t actually see eye to eye during the presidential campaign , so what happened during donald trump s meeting today with pope francis ?
we ll go through that and what drove them apart in the first place , straight ahead on morning joe . '
as she stopped speaking , music began to play .
that is when joe scarborough appeared to criticize trump and imply that he is not a christian : oh , the pope s christian , scarborough said in an apparent reference to the differences between the pope and trump : trump memorably feuded with the pope last year when the religious leader suggested anyone who focused on building walls is not christian .
trump , who campaigned on building a southern border wall , shot back that to question his faith was disgraceful .
