brussels ( reuters ) - an independent catalonia would have to apply to join the european union , the president of the executive european commission said on thursday , adding that such a policy would apply to any new state .
catalonia s parliament has laid the ground for a referendum on independence from madrid on oct. 1 , although spain s constitutional court has suspended the vote .
judges are now considering whether the legislation contravenes spain s constitution .
if there were to be a yes vote in favor of catalan independence , then we will respect that opinion .
but catalonia will not be able to be an eu member state on the day after such a vote , commission chief jean-claude juncker said on youtube and broadcast by euronews .
echoing a stance made by his predecessor , jose manuel barroso , juncker said any newly independent state must follow the same eu membership procedures as all aspirants , citing scotland and , in jest , his home country , luxembourg .
if northern luxembourg were to cede from the south , the same rules would apply , juncker said .
the eu s accession negotiations are an arduous process that involve complying with all eu standards and rules and winning the consent of all eu governments .
this means that spain would be able to block catalonia s eu accession if it wished .
croatia was the last country to join the eu , in 2013 after first applying for membership in 2003 .
