new york ( reuters ) - democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders is in “ overall very good health , ” with no limitations on his work as a u.s. senator , his physician said in a letter released on thursday .
the letter from brian monahan , the attending physician for congress , detailed the health of the vermont senator , who is vying with hillary clinton for his party ’ s nomination to the november 2016 presidential election .
“ you are in overall very good health and active in your professional work , and recreational lifestyle without limitation , ” said the jan. 20 letter posted on sanders ’ campaign website .
presidential candidates often release such statements to assure voters that they are fit for the presidency .
the race between clinton and sanders , 74 , has tightened in recent weeks , and polls show the two in a statistical dead heat for the iowa caucus on feb. 1 .
the letter notes that sanders has , over the years , been treated for conditions ranging from gout to hypothyroidism to diverticulitis .
he has also had surgery to repair hernias and excise a vocal cord cyst , the letter said .
the senator also takes levothyroxine daily and indomethacin occasionally , it added .
levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism , and indomethacin is used treat stiffness and pain from osteoarthritis , according to the u.s. national library of medicine .
sanders ’ main democratic rival , hillary clinton , released a statement from her own doctor last year giving her a clean bill of health .
