washington ( reuters ) - the white house ’ s top economic adviser , jason furman , said on tuesday that the united states has ample capacity to boost spending to cushion any future economic downturn .
furman , at a news conference on president barack obama ’ s final budget proposal , said that gross domestic product growth may be slowing somewhat , but that is being offset in a fiscal context by lower unemployment and lower-than-expected interest rates , and a continued decline in healthcare costs .
“ our country has the fiscal room , if and when it is ever needed at some hypothetical future date , to use fiscal policy as one of the tools that we would deploy in those circumstances , ” furman said .
