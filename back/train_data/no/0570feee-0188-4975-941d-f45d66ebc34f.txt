beijing ( reuters ) - a young chinese climbing enthusiast s fatal fall from a skyscraper while making a selfie video on a $ 15,000 rooftopping dare has spurred warnings by state media against the perils of livestreaming .
wu yongning plunged to his death from a 62-storey building in central china on nov. 8 , the day he stopped posting videos of his skyscraper exploits on weibo , china s equivalent of twitter .
a month later , his girlfriend confirmed the death of the 26-year old in a weibo post .
wu , who had more than 60,000 followers of his weibo account , was looking to win a prize of 100,000 yuan ( $ 15,110 ) for a filmed stunt atop huayuan hua center in changsha , capital of hunan province , media said over the weekend .
his death was a reminder of the need for stronger supervision of livestreaming apps , the official china daily said on tuesday .
some of them try to hype things up with obscene and dangerous things , and their purpose is to attract more eyeballs and make a profit , it said in a commentary .
tens of thousands of chinese post videos of themselves in a bid for stardom on the livestreaming scene , whose popularity has grown rapidly , particularly in the e-commerce , social networking and gaming sectors .
wu , who used to post videos of himself scaling tall buildings with no safety equipment , hoped to use the prize to pay his mother s medical bills , the changsha evening news said .
it was unclear which livestreaming platform wu intended to post on .
there should be a bottom line for livestreaming platforms , and supervision should leave no loopholes , ran a comment in the online edition of the people s daily .
wu s videos on his weibo microblog had attracted several million views each .
