panama city ( reuters ) - panama s government will send an immigration and security delegation to china , the country s president said on tuesday , as part of the lifting of visa restrictions for chinese visitors .
chinese visitors to panama will now need an electronic visa stamped in a consulate instead of a restricted visa obtained through a lawyer to visit the country , part of measures the government hopes will promote tourism and investment .
the security and migration delegation will travel to china for the opening of the panamanian consulate , though there was no exact date yet , said president juan carlos varela .
in june , panama established diplomatic ties with china , breaking with self-ruled taiwan in a major victory for beijing , the second most important customer of its key shipping canal .
