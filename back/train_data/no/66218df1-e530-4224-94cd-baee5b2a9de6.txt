bill and hillary clinton have been married for 41 years today .
obviously , their marriage has had its public ups and downs , but unlike about half of all americans ( and donald trump , who s been married three times and has proudly cheated on all of his wives ) , they have stuck it out.bill took to twitter to send his wife a love note of sorts:41 years ago i married my best friend and the finest changemaker i ve ever known .
and yes , i m still in awe of her !
bill clinton ( @ billclinton ) october 11 , 2016of course , 41 isn t exactly a milestone anniversary , and hillary is a bit busy , so she hasn t tweeted back yet , but last year , they had an adorable exchange.40 years ago , i married the cute guy from the library .
happy anniversary , @ billclinton you ve still got it !

@ billclinton where s the word love ?
susan reaney ( @ ssreaney ) october 11 , 2016well , susan , perhaps the word love is said multiple times a day , in private .
or , perhaps it s not said at all .
marriages based on friendships are not unusual , and often , they are the strongest marriages of all .
in other words , it s none of your business.some got their talking points directly from trump .
@ bethrenaldi @ billclinton @ hillaryclinton happy rapist to both of you , enjoy your day sm ( @ enominepatris ) october 11 , 2016 @ billclinton rapist horror-hay ( @ hellcopters ) october 11 , 2016 @ gamerigame @ hellcopters @ billclinton he admitted it , how could you be so gullible .

if they were , they would never vote for trump .
they honestly don t care if a man cheats on a woman .
they re fine with donald cheating on melania .
their only objection is if the woman in the marriage is strong and has her own ambitions.featured image via win mcnamee/getty images .
