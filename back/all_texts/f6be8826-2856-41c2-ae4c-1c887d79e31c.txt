MOSCOW (Reuters) - The State Duma lower house of Russia s parliament voted on Wednesday to bar correspondents of U.S. mass media, including The Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, from attending its sessions, the Interfax news agency reported.
On Tuesday, these two media outlets were officially designated as foreign agents by Russia s justice ministry, a move aimed at complicating their work in retaliation for what Moscow says is unacceptable U.S. pressure on Russian media.
