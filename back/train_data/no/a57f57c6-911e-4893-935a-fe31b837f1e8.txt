brussels ( reuters ) - the european union should be ready to start negotiating details of a post-brexit transition period with britain early in the new year , a senior eu official said on friday , but talks on future trade will take longer .
both sides were already fairly clear on the structure of a transition period likely to last for around two years after britain leaves the eu in march 2019 and involve london accepting almost all eu rules without having a say in making them .
we could easily engage on those issues very early in the new year , the official told reporters after the eu executive accepted that britain had offered enough on divorce terms for it to recommend to governments that they discuss the future .
for negotiations to start on the principles of a future relationship , the eu would need more details from britain on what it wants after the transition and would then have to draw up a fuller set of guidelines for negotiators probably at a summit in february or march , though possibly later , the official said .
the intention would be to have a framework agreement on future relations ready by the time britain leaves .
formal negotiations on a full free trade agreement would not , however , start until britain is no longer a member .
eu negotiator michel barnier has said he believes that a full trade agreement can be negotiated in about three years , so that it could be ready by the end of the transition period .
if it is not , the eu official noted , then there would a cliff edge scenario for trade relations when the transition period ends .
he stressed that the eu would not agree to a long transition , though it has not specified how long that should be .
the eu notes that britain has asked for a transition of around two years .
