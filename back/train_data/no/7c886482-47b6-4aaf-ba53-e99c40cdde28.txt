now that she s finally beaten the old cranky socialist in one state .hillary s on fire !
hillary tells crowd , we don t need to make america great again , it s already great .
the big question is , can hillary do everything she promised from a jail cell ? the best part of her speech is when she reminds the crowd that her campaign is being funded by the clinton slush fund , hollywood vagina voters and wall street grassroots donors .
hillary says , tomorrow this campaign goes national .
maybe i m missing something but hasn t it been national for a long time ?
hasn t everyone known she s been running for president for the last 25 years ?
grass roots donors are powering this campaign .
that s rich , given her big donor backing is the bulwark her campaign .
she then begs for people to go to her website and donate money .
this victory is for the parents and teachers in rural south carolina , she says with affected accent.she s clearly positioning herself as the unifier .
we re going to start by working together , with more love and kindness in our hearts and more respect for each other , even when we disagree .
and she s already telegraphing how she would attack trump , if he were the nominee .
despite what you hear , we don t need to make america great again , america has never stopped being great .
but we do need to make america whole again .
instead of building walls , we need to be tearing down barriers .
she then went on to lie about the facts in several high profile deaths of black young people.hillary finds her manufactured southern drawl at about the 1:55 mark .
