Unfortunately, we will be losing President Obama at noon on January 20th, and he will be replaced with Donald Trump.
Think about that one of the most loving, classy, dignified, accepting, extraordinary men on the planet will be replaced with a buffoon who is quite possibly the most vengeful, bigoted, fraudulent, dangerous man to ever walk the earth.
It is truly an American tragedy.
Well, we progressives on the ground aren t the only ones who feel this way.
There are celebrities who are missing President Obama just as much as we are, and they wanted to make sure he knew it.The likes of A-listers like Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen DeGeneres and more are making sure to give President Obama a great send-off.
They all got together and produced an emotional video entitled Yes We Can: Your Most Memorable Moments from the Obama Presidency.
In the video, the stars tell stories of their memories of President Obama s eight years in office, and what it meant to them.
Here are just a few quotes:John Legend: I never cried from an election result before.Leonardo DiCaprio: When I was at the U.N. and I heard our president say that climate change is the most important issue facing, not only this generation but also future generations, it was inspiring.
Ellen DeGeneres: The CVS experience with Michelle (Obama) was pretty cool and dancing with Barack at his birthday party.
And he s a good dancer.
He should not get any flack for that you re a good dancer.
Alongside the A-listers, there are also children speaking of what President Obama has meant to them, and how he made them feel.
The video is absolutely heartwarming and heartbreaking as well, considering what we are up against now.
