does anyone else get the sense biden was picked to be the vp just to make obama look smart ? vice president joe biden remarked at a hillary clinton campaign event thursday that it s ok sometimes to be an uninformed guy who has no idea what the hell he s talking about .
biden , however , was referring to republican presidential nominee donald trump .
i don t believe the guy s a bad guy .
i just think he is thoroughly , totally , completely uninformed , biden said .
he has no idea what the hell he s talking about .
and guess what ?
that s ok sometimes .
that s ok sometimes .
biden went on to point out for the rally audience , for the second time in less than a month , the military aide who travels with him and holds the nuclear launch codes in case something happens to the president .
