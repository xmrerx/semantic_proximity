paris ( reuters ) - two french ministers said on tuesday they had no immediate plans to overhaul legislation to make it easier to target corrupt foreign firms - a change demanded by their own anti-graft agency .
charles duchaine , head of the new afa anti-graft body , told reuters last week that the current law , brought in just a year ago , had to be re-drawn as it gave him almost no powers to pursue foreign companies .
he repeated the point at a conference on tuesday .
but justice minister nicole belloubet responded at the same event that she wanted to see how the sapin 2 legislation worked on the ground before making any alterations .
we re not going to rewrite the law every morning , she said .
budget minister gerald darmanin told the conference : it is important that the agency first gets on with its work .
under the law , the afa agency can only target public bodies and companies with more than 500 employees and turnover of above 100 million euros ( $ 118.19 million ) , or subsidiaries of foreign companies that are headquartered in france and meet those two criteria .
afa s work has got off to a slow start .
it was created by the sapin 2 act a year ago but only launched its first investigations in october .
the ministers said there was funding to increase the number of afa agents to 70 from 50 .
