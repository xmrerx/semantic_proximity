the first black ( and half white ) president has successfully created the most divisive america we have seen since the civil rights movement .
he probably forgot he was raised by white grandparents , and on occasion a white mom.obama s silence about the black lives matter terror movement speaks volumes about his approval for the hateful and violent behavior towards whites and our brave law enforcement officers .
keith scott , a black man with a gun who was told to put it down by officers surrounding his vehicle was shot and killed by a black police officer in charlotte , nc .
charlotte rioted .
a protester rioter was shot and killed by another protester rioter .
no one rioted over his death .
today , keith scott s brother has a message for america .
he delivered it to this reporter .
it s his message , but it was likely inspired by the silence of barack obama on yet another major city being burned and looted by out-of-control rioters funded by george soros , one of barack s biggest supporters.here is a message from keith scott s brother to america : nsfw language : tonight hear reaction from the brother of a @ cmpd shooting vitcim on @ wcnc at 11. pic.twitter.com/kckyyi2oni trey ( @ treymaggio ) september 21 , 2016
