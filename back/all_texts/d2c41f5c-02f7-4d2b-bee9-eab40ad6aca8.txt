It s gotten to the point that if you re still considering voting for Donald Trump in November, you ve got to be completely fine with voting for a scam artist and a misogynistic racist.
Now, if those are things that you can overlook because of the simplistic view of party line politics, well, that s just sad, but it s your vote.Pointing out Trump s blatant racism, and ever-obvious scam artist antics is Seth Meyers on Late Night during a segment he calls A Closer Look.
Meyers informed his audience of what Trump University is fraud.He said: Trump University was founded in 2005, promising to teach people how to make money off real estate.
But, as the Washington Post reported, it wasn t a university or even a school; it was just a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country.'
Meyers then compared getting a degree in business at Trump University is about as valid as getting a medical degree at the Holiday Inn Express.
He also pointed out that Trump University is so bad, and so fraudulent, that it scammed mothers trying to feed their kids and even Bernie Madoff would say, Wow, dog, that s not cool.
Not only did Meyers go elbow deep into describing how much of a scam artist Trump is, but also how racist he is.
He perfectly summarized it with this one statement: Now to be clear, claiming that someone is not able to do their job because of their race is, by definition, racism.
Period.
And in regards to Trump pointing and calling out his African-American and Republicans all of a sudden seeming to realize Trump is racist, Meyers said: Republicans can t pretend to suddenly be shocked and offended, this is who Trump was well before this latest outburst, and this is who [the GOP is] lining up to support So remember this when Trump inevitably tries to convince you he s not a racist.
Because guess what?
He is.Watch the segment here:Featured image via video screen capture
