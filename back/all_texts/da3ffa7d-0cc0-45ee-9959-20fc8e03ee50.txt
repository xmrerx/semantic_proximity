WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday slapped sanctions on seven Iranian individuals and two entities, alleging involvement in either malicious cyber activities or enabling Tehran s ballistic missile program.
The action, announced on the U.S. Treasury Department s website, freezes any assets they may hold in the United States and prohibits U.S. individuals from doing business with them.
(Corrects first paragraph to say ballistic missile program, not nuclear program.)
