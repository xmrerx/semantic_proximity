things got very uncomfortable for jason chaffetz as he attended a town hall in utah thursday night.chaffetz , the lead hillary clinton benghazi witch hunter who is currently ignoring the actions of the trump administration particularly with regard to the donald s yemen raid , which killed 30 civilians ( including an american girl ) and left a navy seal dead found himself met with a chorus of boos from his capacity audience at brighton high school in a salt lake suburb , especially when he mentioned the name of the orange buffoon in the white house.boy , was it a sh * tshow !
the huffington post reports : the house oversight committee chairman was challenged on donald trump s threat to eliminate obamacare , his vow to slash support for women s health by cutting planned parenthood funds , a push to sell public lands and the confirmation of betsy devos as education secretary .
at one point , chaffetz promised the voters that they would be happy with the bill to abolish the department of education .
the crowd was not amused.thousands of others who were not allowed in the auditorium because of police concerns about crowd control remained outside brandishing protest signs and chanting , chaffetz is a coward !
kutv channel 2 reported , and do your job !
and your last term !
one young girl asked chaffetz what he was was going to do to protect the environment .
do you believe in science ?
because i do , she said to loud cheers .
i don t pretend to have all the answers , he responded .
there are good people on both sides of the aisle , he added to resounding boos.to add to his humiliation , a teacher stood up and humiliated chaffetz , likening the trump administration to her students and demanding to know where chaffets draws his line in the sand with regard to the trump family s conflicts of interest .
his answer was shameful : everyone has to comply with the law , chaffetz responded .
you re really not going to like this part , again to boos .
the president , under the law , is exempt from the conflict-of-interest laws .

lol # chaffetztownhall pic.twitter.com/cq8dx8bbxa scott wessman ( @ scottew ) february 10 , 2017chaffetz turned tail and fled 40 minutes before his town hall was scheduled to end .
many , of course , noticed that while hillary clinton could handle 11 hours of chaffetz s ridiculous benghazi witch hunt , he couldn t hack being confronted by voters for the length of one town hall : @ jasoninthehouse ca n't break hillary in 11 hours of hearings , but he breaks down and leaves his voters 40 mins early ?
