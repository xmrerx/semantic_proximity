ankara ( reuters ) - turkish president tayyip erdogan said on tuesday his talks with u.s. president donald trump last week were the first occasion in a long time the two nato allies were on the same wavelength and they would speak against this week .
diplomatic ties between ankara and washington have been strained by several disagreements , particularly over the united states support for the ypg syrian kurdish militia , which ankara regards as a terrorist group .
the telephone call which we had with trump on friday was the first in a long time in which we got on the same wavelength , erdogan said in a speech to deputies from his ruling ak party in parliament .
he said discussions would continue in the coming days on the issues of the ypg , defense industry cooperation and the fight against the network of a u.s.-based cleric whom ankara accuses of orchestrating last year s failed coup in turkey .
according to turkey s foreign minister , trump on friday told erdogan he had issued instructions that weapons should not be provided to the syrian kurdish ypg .
however , the pentagon said on monday it was reviewing adjustments in arms for syrian kurdish forces , but it stopped short of halting weapons transfers , suggesting such decisions would be based on battlefield requirements .
speaking to reporters in parliament after his speech , erdogan said the pentagon statement would be discussed at turkey s national security council ( mgk ) meeting later on tuesday .
he also said that trump indicated that another call may happen this week .
if he doesn t call , i ll call , erdogan said .
the ypg spearheads the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias fighting islamic state with the help of a u.s.-led coalition .
turkey regards the ypg as an extension of the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , which has fought a decades-long insurgency in turkey and is designated a terrorist group by ankara , the united states and european union .
