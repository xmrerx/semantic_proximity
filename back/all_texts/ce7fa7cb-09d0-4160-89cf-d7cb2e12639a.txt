WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will nominate veteran appeals court judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, several sources familiar with the selection process told Reuters.
Earlier a source told Reuters that appeals court judge Sri Srinivasan was most likely to be picked, then later said Garland was a stronger possibility.
