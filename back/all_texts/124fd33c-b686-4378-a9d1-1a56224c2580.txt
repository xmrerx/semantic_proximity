Oh boy!
This is getting good!
Bill Clinton is now accusing the FBI of serving up a load of bull in the comments about the investigation into Hillary s e-mails.
How idiotic is it to publicly slam the FBI?
I guess Slick Willy isn t so slick anymore.
all we have to say about this is KEEP ON TALKIN SLICK WILLY!Bill Clinton is accusing the FBI director of serving up the biggest load of bull I ve ever heard marking the first significant public comments from the husband of the Democratic nominee on the scandal that s plagued his wife s campaign for over a year.
First of all, the FBI director said, when he testified before Congress, he had to amend his previous day s statement that she had never received any emails marked classified, Clinton told journalists at an Asian American Journalists Association meeting in Las Vegas on Friday, making a strong defense for Hillary Clinton.He added, They saw two little notes with a C on it this is the biggest load of bull I ve ever heard that were about telephone calls that she needed to make.
The State Department typically puts a little C on it to discourage people from discussing it in public in the event the secretary of state, whoever it is, doesn t make a telephone call.
Does that sound threatening to the national security to you?
