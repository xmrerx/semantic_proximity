Several attendees left Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s Saturday rally in Bangor to find their parked cars vandalized with white spray paint.A Bangor police spokesman said officers were seeking witnesses and reviewing video in the criminal mischief case at the New York City billionaire s us-against-them speech blasting a rigged system at the Cross Insurance Center.More than 20 cars parked between the Bangor Raceway and Buck Street were hit with lines of white paint.
Attendees said the owners of some of the cars appeared to drive off without noticing without the vandalism.Paul Foster, a painter and Trump supporter from Eastbrook whose van was painted, said the rally couldn t have been more peaceful, but he blamed the vandalism on Trump opponents, saying there ain t no thinking about it, I know so.
