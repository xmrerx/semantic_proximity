( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump on wednesday called for a “ 21st century ” version of the 1933 glass-steagall law that required the separation of commercial and investment banking , a change the republican party also supported in its 2016 policy platform .
trump gave no details about his banking plan other than to say he would prioritize “ helping african american businesses get the credit they need. ” democrat hillary clinton ’ s husband , former president bill clinton , signed legislation in 1999 that repealed glass-steagall .
u.s. banking law was comprehensively revised by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act in 2010 as a response to the financial crisis of 2008 .
