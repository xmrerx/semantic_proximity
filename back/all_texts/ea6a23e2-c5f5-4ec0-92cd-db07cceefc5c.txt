PRETORIA (Reuters) - South Africa s High Court ruled on Wednesday that an inquiry into alleged state influence-peddling in President Jacob Zuma s government should be established as recommended by the anti-graft watchdog in a report released a year ago.
Zuma had challenged the right of the report s author to call for a judicial inquiry and the appointment of a judge to head it by the Chief Justice.
Zuma said it was his prerogative to set up such an inquiry.
