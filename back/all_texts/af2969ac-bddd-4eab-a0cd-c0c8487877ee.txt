Seriously?
How pathetic is this?
In an effort to score some publicity, Eminem performed a free style rap saying disgusting things about President Trump.
It s clear now that POTUS was not biting TRUMP GETS THE LAST LAUGH!Eminem says he is extremely angry President Trump never responded to his BET Awards freestyle: I feel like he s not paying attention to me.
I was kinda waiting for him to say something, and for some reason, he didn t say anything.
