BERLIN (Reuters) - It is incredibly unlikely that Britain will not be able to negotiate a deal with the European Union on its departure from the bloc, Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Thursday.
Davis told a business conference in Berlin he hoped the European Commission would be able by Christmas to proceed to the next stage of Brexit negotiations - on future ties between Britain and the EU.
Davis added that he expected Prime Minister Theresa May to remain in office for the duration of the Brexit negotiations and beyond.
