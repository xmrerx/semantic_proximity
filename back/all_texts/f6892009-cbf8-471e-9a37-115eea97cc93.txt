BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that work on settling Britain s financial obligations to the EU when it leaves was not even halfway done.
He said more than half the work remained to be completed on the crucial issue of Britain s exit bill and that discussions could not move to the next phase on the future relationship until the three divorce issues of citizens rights, the Irish border and financial settlement have been settled.
A lot is in the hands of Theresa May, Macron said in a news conference at the end of an EU summit.
