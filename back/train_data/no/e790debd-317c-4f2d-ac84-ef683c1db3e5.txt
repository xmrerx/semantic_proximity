the top democrat in the senate , chuck schumer ( ny ) , claimed sunday that president trump is in trouble , a stern warning that came a day after the commander-in-tweet claimed president obama wiretapped him.citing president obama s denial that he ordered a wiretap of trump , schumer said , either way the president s in trouble .
if he falsely spread this kind of misinformation , that is so wrong .
it s beneath the dignity of the presidency .
it is something that really hurts people s view of government , he said.yeah , because making the embarrassing , race-baiter-for-hire al sharpton a regular visitor at the white house is somehow not beneath the dignity of the presidency ?
you mean like taking selfies during the funeral of one of the greatest civil rights leaders in the world ?
or traveling to cuba to hang out at a baseball game with raul castro , who along with his brother are some of the most brutal dictators in the world ? were watergate reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein shamed for making government look bad when they uncovered the wire-tapping done by president nixon ?
he deserved it ?
really chuck ?
because he was running against hillary clinton or because he was simply on the wrong team ?
if he were a democrat , would have have deserved it ?
on the other hand , if it s true , it s even worse for the president .
because that means that a federal judge , independently elected , has found probable cause that the president , or people on his staff , have probable cause to have broken the law or to have interacted with a foreign agent , new york s senior senator claimed .
