Donald Trump Junior was attending a rally when a heckler yelled out a question:Protester: What about your dad s taxes?
I want to see his taxes!Donald Jr.: Oh, I don t know.
I think Rachel Maddow released something that showed he made $150 million bucks and paid $45 million in taxes.
I think the ones that were released showed he paid a much higher percentage in tax than Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama.
And made a lot of money in the process.
So guess what?
You can do it all!
You can be successful.
You can pay your taxes.
And I think that s what he did.
So I really appreciate it.
Thank you for the intro to that because I wouldn t have gone there.KFBB.com News, Sports and WeatherGreat answer!
