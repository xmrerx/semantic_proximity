andrew korybko global village spacethe u deployment himars missile system eastern syria design deter syrian arab army dash deir azzormany people catch guard russian defense ministry announce earlier week u redeploy two high mobility artillery rocket system jordan u special operation force base near syrian town altanf range himars allow provide support uscontrolled syrian democratic force sdf operate daesh raqqa
lead logical conclusion himars could use u strike syrian arab army saa force pentagon develop habit several time already since aprilto put context saa break daesh occupy territory reach iraqi border thereby cut u special force allied rebel force altanf link majoritykurdish syrian democratic force sdf lay siege raqqa right commit ethnic cleansing
moreover development prevent usbacked force drive desert deir azzor last major daeshoccupied city eastern syria location small encircled saa contingent
dash deir azzor become new race raqqa latter former decide whether entirety eastern syria fall proamerican proxy control notthe saa need liberate deir azzor order keep sdf southern altanf rebel connect occupied territory enlarge selfdeclared democratic federation northern syria include iraqi border
fail task syria effectively divide along eastwest line former half could principle connect corresponding demographic region neighbor iraq give rise unipolar transnational substates kurdistan sunnistan word two geopolitical israel
succeed however saa diminish prospect prosaudi sunnistan along syrianiraqi borderland would also give damascus fair chance recover territory north euphrates reverse sdfypg federalization momentumfor reason u deploy himars southeastern syria order deter saa go dash deir azzor though mean damascus win give shot anyhow
high chance russia warn u use missile system saa equal probability moscow interfere casewhat russia stance bemoscow abundantly clear strictly abide antiterrorist military mandate already proven much multiple occasion stand whenever israeli partner bomb saa damascus ally
moreover russia also never militarily respond u bombing saa three time happen many monthsin fact first deputy chairman federation council committee international affair vladimir jabarov declare right first incident russia intention use aerospace force u missile washington decides carry new strike syria could lead largescale war thereby confirm close chance russia would come syria aid u unleashed himars deir azzordestined saa force
despite unfavorable state affair damascus likely win discourage could still well make dash desert town regardless himars hindrance
even event soldier martyr syria might calculate sacrifice would worth even slight possibility help delay country postwar decentralization defacto internal partitionabout eventuality indicator point basically fait accompli moment due russia reluctance stop scenario unfold
actually russia even go along extent though due interest happening political commit military force necessary stop also likely understand process irreversible
moscow choose take middle ground damascus unitary vision kurdish adversary federalist one propose system decentralization russianwritten draft constitution syria
furthermore ground believe russia deescalation zone ultimately whether wittingly inadvertently lead creation decentralization unit throughout country especially kurdish rebel occupy quarterstaking account imply russia action lack thereof preferred political settlement war syria concrete reason argue moscow might already accept defacto establishment two transnational substate entity kurdistan sunnistan exchange washington implicitly agree interfere russia two military base western part country damascusgranted right rebuild syria energy infrastructure would extent also include facility proamerican occupied area
whether sort understandingagreement place even u would fully respect matter speculation independently confirm time analytical reading situation indicate might well casewith mind saa might enjoy direct support russian aerospace force long fight liberate occupied territory daesh terrorist proamerican sdfypg southeastern rebel force moscow recognize part political opposition
russia attitude seem whatever u saa newly deploy himars strictly bilateral affair two conflict participant moscow would continually display propensity turn way practical intent purpose issue political statement support ontheground allytherefore outcome dash deir azzor depend speed saa reach destination tactical maneuver sdfypg take beat northern direction degree u successful use himars tip balance favor southern front
odds overwhelm still rule saa ultimately prevail pincer strategy liberate desert city drive stake heart u attempt set two geopolitical israel heart mideast though prospect optimistic scenario play admittedly low
