21st century wire says the wagon wheels are already coming off of the nato-gcc regime change road show in syria.now , foreign policy buffoons in washington are resorting to some of the most desperate tactics seen yet , including more semantic maneuvers to try and conceal their lethal aid for jihadist terrorists in syria and iraq.washington s latest pr thrust began last week when it was proudly announced in the us media al nusra front ( al qaeda in syria ) was rebranding itself into a newer , supposedly kinder and gentler terrorist moniker , syrian conquest front .
charming.washington spin doctors are now desperately back-pedaling , following an embarrassing challenge by donald trump to both president obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton claiming it was they who founded isis ( see article below ) .
contrary to all facts and multiple previous admissions , washington are now claiming that it has never backed and armed terrorists , but rather non-jihadist salafists ( an oxymoron ) .
the other popular lie that washington and the other nato governments have been pushing is that the syrian rebels are actually from syria .
the reality is that the overwhelming majority of terrorist rebel fighters are from outside syria soldiers of fortune and paid privateers from as many as 81 different countries of origin.see also : proof : us and nato-backed rebels are not fighting isisit s clear now that washington has dug such a deep hole with regards to its sponsorship of the dirty war in syria that it simply can not get out without losing face internationally and domestically.the domestic side is particularly worrisome for democratic party leaders obama and clinton , because it is an election year and clinton has built most of her campaign on her foreign policy credentials which now includes the prenatal and pediatric development of isis and al nusra front .
to say that clinton was one of the architects of the current conflict is no exaggeration , as she was actively promoting regime change by any means in europe and the middle east in 2011 and 2012 with her cynically titled friends of syria controlled opposition tour .
front : hillary clinton fronted the friends of syria tour through 2011-2012 , in order consolidate gulf and other support for regime change and the present dirty war in syria.to those who have been reading between the western spin on syria over the last 4 years , the truth about this washington-led dirty war in syria should come as no surprise : that the obama administration s policy of supporting extremist armed terrorist opposition groups in syria was part of a deliberate strategy explicitly designed to topple the government in damascus and its elected president bashar al-assad .
by doing this , washington and its allies have facilitated the creation of islamic state ( isis , isil , is or daesh ) caliphate in syria and iraq.a recent sputnik article confirms how hillary clinton pressed through the policy of backing the myriad of known extremist terrorist groups by just referring to them as moderate rebels : in december 2012 , only months after the defense intelligence report , president obama caved to secretary of state hillary clinton and the more hawkish wing of the national security establishment saying the united states considered the opposition to be the legitimate representative of the syrian people .
by maintaining a strict policy of media deception regarding syria , the us state department believed that it could avoid any responsibility and obfuscate its own sponsorship audit trail by playing a sophomoric and highly cynical name game between moderate rebels and known terrorist organizations like jabhat al-nusra front ( al qaeda in syria ) , jaysh al-islam , ahrar al-sham , harakat nour al-din al-zenki , the turkmen brigades and many more .
aside from those living in the reality bubble that is washington and its media stable , most people are now well aware that there are no moderate rebels in syria and no matter how many name changes are announced by operatives at cnn or site intelligence they are still all terrorists and they are all fighting ( including isis ) together to overthrow the government in syria .
21wire previously covered cnn s sordid role in running pr for the jihadist terrorists groups in syria , led by cnn s star journalist , clarissa ward ( pictured above , in her undercover muslim costume ) , who has become one of the corporate media s leading apologists for us-nato and gcc-sponsored violent militant extremists presently running amok in syria , as cnn and ward have gone out of their way to try and rehabilitate us-nato and gcc-backed terrorist suicide bombers in syria.interestingly , cnn s media operative ward even took the pr roadshow to the un , using her cnn-pentagon profile to push out washington s new pro-al nusra ( al qaeda ) pr campaign .
sputnik added here : perhaps embodying the confusing about face of america s foreign policy in syria was when a member of the press , cnn s senior international correspondent clarissa ward , testified before the un security council on the situation in aleppo that the only ones who have emerged as heroes on the ground are the islamist factions , even to those who hate fundamentalism .
leading from behind : obama kept insisting that , assad must go .
for years now , us president obama , secretaries of state john kerry and hillary clinton et all have been clamouring in unison that , assad must go .
now it looks as if assad might outlast all of them.while the blatant distortion of reality continues by the us state department and its media functionaries like clarissa ward and cnn , the west s dirty war in syria rages on and with washington , nato and saudi-qatari money and arms still flowing there is no end in sight .
sputnikthe obama administration s policy in syria of opposing assad at all costs has led the united states to make strange bedfellows arming non-jihadist salafist groups who are unfortunately led by a cadre of fighters from the former al-qaeda affiliate al-nusra front.this week republican nominee donald trump caused an uproar by insisting that his democratic rival former secretary of state hillary clinton and her former boss president barack obama founded isis a charge that led to an counter assault by hillary surrogate sen. claire mccaskill ( d-mo ) on sunday who levelled a mirror accusation against trump and russian president vladimir putin.while a pentagon memo supports the allegation that in 2012 the united states was willingly aiding al-qaeda in iraq and the islamic state of iraq ( isi ) that subsequently metastasized into daesh , the more immediate conflict of interest in washington s foreign policy in the middle east is the support of the current so-called moderate rebels opposing assad who , by their own admission on social media , are led by al-nusra front.al-nusra front , who just changed their name to the syrian conquest front and renounced affiliation with al-qaeda , with the open acceptance of the terror network , in a bid to garner new support from the west were the leading force in the surprise bid to break the syrian government s siege in aleppo continue this article at sputnikread more syria news at : 21st century wire syria files
