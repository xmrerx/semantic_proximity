it s a federal offense to threaten a presidential candidate .
but is it a federal offense if the candidate is donald trump ?
would the media cover this story if a bar owner suggested a well-known attempted assassin kill hillary ?
is it a clever joke or a threat ?
maybe a little bit of both ?
a sign outside a bar is turning a lot of heads.the message is political and timely and if you understand the context , but it could be considered a possible threat on donald trump .
