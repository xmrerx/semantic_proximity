Following Obama s phony tears, he launched directly into attack mode of the Republican majority Congress (who have already proven their not on our team) and the gun lobby.
All of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobbies lies.
Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad, he said, as he bowed his head for ultimate effect, and then boom as though he never shed a tear, the attack against Republicans and gun lobbies began.Where was his outrage when Kate Steinle was killed by an illegal alien in a Sanctuary City?
Where was his outrage when cops were being killed as a result of his war against cops?
Obama s selective outrage and faux tears aren t fooling anyone who s paying attention This isn t the first time Obama used a fake dramatic scene to promote his agenda.
Remember this phony scene?
Obama was in the middle of his speech promoting socialized medicine, but somehow was able to see a woman behind him about to pass out.
Watch him save her just in the nick of time.
