sochi , russia ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin , a dog lover , received a top breed puppy as a belated birthday gift on wednesday from turkmenistan s president who is keen to recover lost russian markets for turkmen gas .
we have a common friend - this is the world s unique alabai dog .
and today i brought this little alabai with me , president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov said before talks with putin , pulling the pup out from a portable cage and holding it up by the scruff of its neck .
putin , who marked his 65th birthday on oct. 7 , took the puppy , called verny which means faithful in russian , and kissed it in its forehead .
the alabai is a home-bred turkmen variety of the central asian shepherd dog .
along with the handmade carpets and the ancient akhal teke breed of race horses , it is officially listed as part of turkmenistan s national heritage .
plush and cuddly when they are young , alabai dogs grow into fierce shepherd dogs , fearless in warding off wolves but also in dealing with human strangers .
berdymukhamedov , a flamboyant former dentist whose interests range from sport cars to noble horses , enjoys a personality cult and autocratic powers in his desert nation which sits on the world s fourth-largest natural gas reserves .
the two men held talks at the black sea resort of sochi , on the sidelines of a summit of ex-soviet states , with the turkmen side keen to see a possible resumption of natural gas exports to russia .
russia , once the main buyer of turkmen gas , stopped buying the fuel last year due to a price dispute .
china , with its growing appetite for energy , is now the main market for turkmen gas .
some other foreign leaders including those of japan and bulgaria have also given putin puppies of rare breeds as gifts .
