( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential candidate marco rubio said on friday that he doesn ’ t believe conditions currently exist for a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
“ i just don ’ t see the conditions right now for that , ” rubio said at a news conference at a jewish temple in west palm beach , florida .
“ two-state solutions involves the idea that there are two parties that are willing to agree to that , and there are not. ” “ i think israel is willing to be incredibly accommodating and have proven their willingness to do so , ” he said .
“ the palestinian authority has never shown any willingness , in fact they have turned down some very generous offers in the past. ” ( reporting by eric beech in washington ; editing by tim ahmann ) this article was funded in part by sap .
