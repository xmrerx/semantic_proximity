BERLIN (Reuters) - German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he expects all parties elected to parliament to be ready for talks to enable a government to be formed after talks on forging a new ruling coalition collapsed early on Monday.
All political parties elected to the German parliament have an obligation to the common interest to serve our country, Steinmeier said in a statement he read out to media.
I expect from all a readiness to talk to make agreeing a government possible in the near future, he added.
