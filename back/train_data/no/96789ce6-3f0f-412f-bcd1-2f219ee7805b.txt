thank goodness these muslim women have a friend in socialist , radical mayor of new york city an nypd officer pretended to be a brooklyn college student at the islamic society in new york city , and taking the muslim oath of faith , before befriending muslim students to infiltrate the community.the woman , who went by the name of mel , short for melike , spent four years earning the trust of islamic students at the college as part of an nypd operation to spy on muslims , according to ny s daily weblog gothamist.the controversial mission was part of the police departments well-documented plan that sees the blanket surveillance of innocent muslims.the mayor of new york , bill deblasio has openly criticized such surveillance and declared at a ramadan dinner that muslim new yorkers were still fighting for basic human rights .
watch mayor deblasio defend muslim women with ties to al qaeda here : we recently shut down the demographics unit at nypd , which conducted surveillance on muslim new yorkers .
because it s unfair to single out people on the sole basis of their religion , he added .
the undercover operation led to some important arrests .
four years after mel had infiltrated the college , two queens residents , noelle velentzas and asia siddiqui , were arrested and charged with allegedly planning to build a bomb.the us justice department issued a release stating that the women were linked to members of al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula and the islamic state.many of the cases dealt with by the nypd often involve a form of entrapment that see undercover detectives and fbi informants carrying out manipulative tactics in order to secure evidence that will later lead to arrests.in the case of velentzas and siddiqui , four propane gas tanks , as well as instructions for how to turn them into explosive devices , are said to have been found in siddiqui s home , and according to the criminal complaint , the two women had in-depth conversations with the undercover officer about their violent aspirations.the undercover officer established a friendship with at least one of the women as early as 2013 , according to the criminal complaint.the two women are not alleged to have been in the process of planning a specific attack , and according to the criminal complaint , velentzas repeatedly stated she would not want to harm any regular people , instead targeting police or military personnel.after 9/11 , both the nypd and the fbi revamped their approach to terrorism investigations and began operating under a policy of preventive prosecution.the nypd began to look for particular indicators of radicalization such as the wearing of traditional islamic clothing , giving up drinking or smoking , and becoming involved in social activism .
in the nypd s model of measuring threats , which have been criticized , young people were also a key target .
the government often acting through informants is actively involved in developing [ terrorism plots ] , persuading and sometimes pressuring the target to participate , and providing the resources to carry it out , according to the 2014 human rights watch report .
brooklyn college students at the islamic society told gothamist they feel skeptical and paranoid .
in the back of all our minds , there s always that suspicion , that either , you are a spy , or you think i m one , a female muslim student stressed .
