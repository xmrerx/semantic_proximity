A Nebraska State Senator was busted previously for having cybersex on a work computer and now he s in hot water again for a retweet suggesting that protestors at a women s march weren t attractive enough to be sexually assaulted.
Sen. Bill Kintner (R) deactivated his account but because the Internet is forever, here s an image of the retweet:That retweet was unleashed on Sunday and by Monday morning, his office telephone was ringing off the hook, according to Omaha.com, and his voicemail was full.
On Twitter, a #BillKintner hashtag was created.#BillKintner used a government issued laptop for cyber sex and now endorses a tasteless tweet.
Please call his office: (402) 471-2613 pic.twitter.com/aLQqxIgbvt Caleb George (@CalebGeorgeous) January 23, 2017Kintner should have learned from the Women s Marches across America that it s not a good idea to piss of millions of women.What rape culture?
What war on women?FUCK YOU, #BillKintner.

A statement from Sen. @BillKintner.

We re not sure what could possibly be misconstrued here.
He retweeted a meme along with the words, Ladies, I think you re safe by talk show host Larry Elder.
The three women in the photo were holding signs reading Not this pussy and Not mine either in reference to the leaked tape of Trump in which he admits to sexual assaulting women.We didn t realize the protest was a beauty pageant.
Something about Kintner s message makes me think of glass houses.
He s not exactly hot.Omaha.com reports:Sen. Bob Krist of Omaha said Monday it s time for the Legislature to address whether to censure, expel or impeach Kintner for the cybersex incident so that the body can move on to debating bills.
There s a time to be a statesman and there s time to do the state s business, no matter what it takes, he said.After the Legislature adjourned for the day, Krist said he will likely propose a sanction against his colleague, perhaps as early as this week.Krist is a Republican.And yet, somehow the man who bragged about grabbing women by their genitals was elected president.Image via Facebook.
