riyadh ( reuters ) - a saudi-led arab coalition on saturday conceded that an air raid in yemen s capital a day earlier had resulted in civilian casualties , blaming the incident on an unspecified technical error .
the early morning attack in the faj attan area of sanaa hit a vacant building but caused an adjacent apartment block to collapse , killing at least 12 people , six of them children , residents have said .
coalition spokesman colonel turki al-maliki defended the strike as having a legitimate military target , which he said was a houthi command and control center .
he accused the fighters of using civilians as human shields .
a technical error was the reason for the unintentional accident and the house in question was not directly targeted , he said a statement carried by saudi state news agency spa .
maliki said the coalition expressed remorse for collateral damage to civilians but did not specify the extent of casualties .
however , a senior icrc official visited the site of the strike on friday and said , from what we saw on the ground , there was no apparent military target .
yemen s long war involving competing yemeni factions and regional power struggles has killed at least 10,000 people .
millions more have been forced to leave their homes and face disease and hunger .
the houthis and their ally , former president ali abdullah saleh , control much of the north of the country , including sanaa .
yemen s internationally recognised government is backed by the saudi-led military coalition and is based in the south .
the united states and britain provide arms and logistical assistance to the alliance for its campaign .
the issue has caused controversy in britain over the toll on civilians .
as well as military targets , air strikes have hit hospitals and ports , exacerbating the humanitarian crisis .
