It is extremely important to vet the people we put in charge of our children especially in positions of power.
Apparently, a Chowchilla, California school, along with the local police department, failed to do so when it came to school resource officer Timothy Hormel.Hormel is currently on administrative leave because of allegations that he had sex with a minor.
The 35-year-old cop was arrested by the Mandera County Sheriff s office after the accusations surfaced.
As per usual, the police department is conducting an internal investigations in the Hormel s allegedly criminal actions.
According the Sheriff s department, the minor was not a student at any school Hormel was assigned to.What makes this all so frustrating is that a predator like that never should have been anywhere around school children, especially not in a position of power.
There s a reason there are age of consent laws: children do not have the mental and psychological capacity to consent to sex with adults.
Further, Hormel could have used his power as an officer of the law to coerce the sex, if it did indeed happen.Either way, this guy needs to go to jail if he did this, and that Sheriff s department and local school system need to be investigated.Watch a video news report below, via ABC 30:Featured image from video screen capture
