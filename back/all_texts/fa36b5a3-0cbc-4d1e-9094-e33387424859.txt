Washed up television personality Piers Morgan has had a rough 24 hours.Appearing on Bill Maher s Real Time, the Trump supporting former celebrity tried to defend Trump s Muslim ban and justify giving Trump a chance.
The rest of the panel was not interested in appeasing Trump s bigotry.
Most notably, Morgan got publicly humiliated by Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, who flatly told Morgan to take his defense of Trump and f*ck off.
It was beautiful.Here s the video:But Morgan s nightmare 24 hours were just beginning.
Unable to let it go, Morgan immediately spent the next 12 hours screaming that he wasn t owned on Twitter.
As you might suspect, yelling I m not owned!
for half a day on social media almost assuredly means you were, in fact, owned.Enter J.K. Rowling, who took the opportunity to further slay Morgan kicking off a whole new series of meltdowns from Piers.Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I'd always imagined.

Off.
Piers.Piers responded to Rowling s brutal takedown by saying he s never paid attention to Harry Potter (an obvious lie, considering he wrote an entire article about it).
Rowling wasn t impressed.Because you had a premonition that one day the author would roar with laughter at seeing you called out for your bullshit on live TV?
