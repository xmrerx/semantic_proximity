* * * language warning * * * this video will make your blood boil .
my heart bleeds for this veteran who bravely pulled over to confront these terrorist sympathizers .
the veteran was simply asking them to turn the us flag right side up .
the terrorist sympathizers refused to turn the flag over and were actually dragging the flag on the ground during the confrontation.you will see a man in an orange jacket wearing a hat that says navy seal .
after watching this video , you can decide for yourself , but we think he is an imposter .
notice that when asked if he is a veteran by the cameraman , the man in the orange jacket quickly realizes he is wearing a navy seal hat and removes it from his head .
it s hard to believe a navy seal veteran would be standing on the corner with these punks protesting the imprisonment of terrorists by our government.watch and decide for yourself : i wish i knew this iraq veteran .
i would love to shake his hand and thank him for his service in iraq and for defending our flag at home
