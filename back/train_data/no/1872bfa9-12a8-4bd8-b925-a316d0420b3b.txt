charleston , s.c. ( reuters ) - republican jeb bush ’ s presidential campaign has added an ohio political veteran to his team as a national political adviser .
a bush aide said on wednesday that bob paduchik , who was the ohio campaign manager for the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns of jeb ’ s brother george w. bush , is joining the bush campaign .
paduchik also managed ohio republican senator rob portman ’ s campaign for the senate in 2010 , among other political jobs in the state .
in addition , the bush team said that bush , fighting for a strong showing in the south carolina republican primary on saturday , had secured the help of long-time virginia republican fundraiser bobbie kilberg .
kilberg had been helping the presidential campaign of republican new jersey governor chris christie , who dropped out of the race after finishing far back in the pack in the feb. 9 new hampshire primary .
