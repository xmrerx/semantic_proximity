Indiana Gov.
Mike Pence is probably privately wishing he had never been tapped to be Donald Trump s running mate.
Thanks to Trump s erratic behavior and many outrageous, offensive statements, Pence is put into the position of defending him constantly and some things are just not defensible.
Nonetheless, Pence at least has to try.
Appearing on CNN s State of the Union Sunday morning, Pence was forced to respond to the accusations of racism that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leveled at Trump in a blistering takedown that used the tycoons own words and actions to make the case that he s running to be Racist-in-Chief.
Hilariously, Pence dismissed the speech as desperation: I think Sen. [Tim] Kaine s [D-Va.] comments, Hillary Clinton s comments on Thursday night sound desperate to me.
The fact that you see Democrats and Hillary Clinton and her running mate rolling out the same old playbook of racial divisiveness sounds a little bit to me like an act of desperation.
The American people are sick and tired of politicians who seek to divide the people of this country to unite their supporters.
Pence then took the whole Make America Great Again tack, and said he finds the accusations offensive.
Well, Gov.
Pence, your running mate has one hell of a long list of racism.
Here s just a few examples:I think we all know that I could go on forever regarding Trump s racism.
That s just a sampling, off of the top of my head.
Now, Gov.
Pence, please defend these actions as not racist.
Oh, that s right.
You can t. Because these ARE racist actions, and you know it.
However, because you ve been brought on to the Trump campaign to essentially be a pooper scooper, you can t admit that you are, indeed, trying to get a dyed-in-the-wool, bona fide racist elected as president.
