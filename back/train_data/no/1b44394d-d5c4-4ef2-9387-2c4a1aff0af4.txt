many of president donald trump s fellow republicans have been calling for tougher action , imposed more quickly , including calling for stiff secondary sanctions and other punishments for companies , banks and countries that do business with north korea .
in a letter seen by reuters that will be sent to ambassadors from china and 20 other countries , republican senator cory gardner , the subcommittee chairman , asked that the countries immediately end diplomatic and economic relations with pyongyang .
maintaining official diplomatic relations with a regime that continues to defy international law and threaten nations across the globe only serves to reward nefarious behavior , wrote gardner .

gardner recently introduced legislation that would impose a u.s. economic embargo against any entity that does business with north korea .
