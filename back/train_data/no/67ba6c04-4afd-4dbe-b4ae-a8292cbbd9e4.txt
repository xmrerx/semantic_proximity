dubai ( reuters ) - saudi arabian investment firm kingdom holding 4280.se reported it swung to a third-quarter profit on sunday , hours after its billionaire chairman prince alwaleed bin talal was detained as part of a corruption crackdown .
kingdom holding , whose investments include stakes in major international firms such as citigroup ( c.n ) and twitter ( twtr.n ) , said it made 247.5 million riyals ( $ 66 million ) in the three months to sept. 30 , compared with a restated loss of 355 million riyals in the same period a year ago .
it reported a 179.9 million riyal profit for the third quarter last year but the company said on sunday it had restated that figure to be consistent with current figures .
it did not elaborate .
saudi companies moved to internationally accepted ifrs accounting standards this year from a local system .
profit for the third quarter of this year was boosted by an increase in hotel and operating revenues , larger dividend income , and income and gains on investments , the company said .
revenue increased 76 percent to 550 million riyals .
prince alwaleed has been detained by saudi security authorities , a senior saudi official told reuters on sunday .
saudi-owned al arabiya television reported he was detained along with 10 other princes , four current ministers and tens of former ministers in a probe by a new anti-corruption body headed by crown prince mohammed bin salman .
kingdom did not release a statement early on sunday about the detention , and did not respond to requests for comment .
