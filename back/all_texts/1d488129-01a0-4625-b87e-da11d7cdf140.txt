You don t want to miss a second of Judge Jeanine s brilliant analysis of Hillary Vs. Trump Whether you like him or not, Donald Trump talks about real issues.
Hillary says he paints a dark divisive picture of an America in decline.'
But ask yourselves, are you better off?
Do you feel safer than you were before these two came into power?
Is America more united than it was?
Are race relations better?
Is police esteem anywhere near where it was 8 years ago?
Whether you like him or not, Donald Trump is hitting all the core issues.
Asking all of the right questions starting all the right conversations.
A man who is willing to take on political correctness that is DESTROYING this nation.
