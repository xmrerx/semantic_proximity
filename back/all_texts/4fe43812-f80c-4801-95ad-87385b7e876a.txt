Grab your popcorn and sit down because Trump just posted a tweet that proves how delusional he really is.It s been two days since the third presidential debate, and Donald Trump s campaign continues to roll downhill in flames like a rickety gasoline-soaked wagon on fire.But Donald Trump, in yet another lie to his supporters, actually claimed on Twitter that he won the debate by a unanimous decision.
The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON!
Trump wrote.
Thank you, these are very exciting times.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2016Apparently, Donald Trump is confused about what winning actually looks like.Because not only did most reaction polls indicate that Hillary Clinton won the debate, the scientific polls indicate she won as well.A CBS News poll found that 49 percent of debate watchers surveyed said Clinton won, which is 10 points higher than the 39 percent who say Trump won.Similarly, Clinton was declared the winner 46 percent to 37 percent of those surveyed by an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll.Also, the CNN/ORC poll found that Clinton won the debate as well, with 52 percent saying Hillary won versus only 39 percent who said Trump won.And that s not all.
Hillary also beat the hell out of Trump in a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll by 17 points, 43 percent to 26 percent.In other words, Trump LOST the debate on Wednesday night in Las Vegas just as he lost the first two.Twitter users certainly think Trump s declaration of victory is a joke.
Because they mocked him mercilessly after he posted it.
@realDonaldTrump HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAH(deep breath)HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHHASo sad.

In the real world, the exact opposite is true.

Second place.

Vaughan (@rvaughanw) October 21, 2016Can you imagine if Donald Trump declares himself the winner on Election Day after the popular and electoral vote reveal that Hillary won?
Because while it s funny to watch Trump call himself the winner of a debate, it won t be very funny if he does the same thing on November 8th even though all of the results clearly show that he is wrong.Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
