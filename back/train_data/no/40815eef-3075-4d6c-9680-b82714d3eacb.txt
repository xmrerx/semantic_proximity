new york ( reuters ) - wells fargo & co ( wfc.n ) said it supported a “ best-interest ” standard for wealth management clients and was reviewing a new rule detailed by the u.s. department of labor on wednesday .
wells , which operates one of the largest u.s. wealth management businesses , said it had a “ robust plan in place ” to review the new rule and make necessary changes .
the rule aims to ensure brokers put clients ’ best interest ahead of their own profits when handling their retirement savings .
the labor department proposed a tougher rule years ago , but ultimately softened it to address industry concerns .
( this story has been refiled to say wells fargo supports best-interest standard , rather than broader rule . )
