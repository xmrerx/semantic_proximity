Donald Trump just doesn t know how to keep his mouth shut and he continues to receive the mockery he deserves.On Monday night, the Republican nominee accused Hillary Clinton of being to blame for the recent execution of Iranian spy Shahram Amiri, who gave information about Iran s nuclear program to the CIA.Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton s hacked emails.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2016He directly mentioned Hillary Clinton s email as the reason why Amiri was killed, but the New York Times notes: Among the side players was Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, who said as Mr. Amiri was returning to Iran: He s free to go.
He was free to come.
Those decisions are his alone to make.
Some of her emails, made public last year during the controversy over her private email server, show that her top foreign policy aide warned her that the story was about to break, but they give little insight into what happened behind the scenes.In short, Amiri chose to return to Iran even though he was warned that doing so could result in his death.
Hillary s emails had nothing to do with his demise.But Trump made the accusation anyway and Twitter users were swift in dealing out mockery with the hashtag #ManyPeopleAreSaying.
