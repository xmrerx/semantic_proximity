washington ( reuters ) - there are no signs that a blockade of yemen s ports by a saudi-led military coalition has eased to allow aid to reach communities increasingly at risk of starvation , the head of the u.s. government s aid agency said on tuesday .
usaid administrator mark green called on the saudi-led military coalition to open yemen s ports and for yemen s houthis to cease firing to allow food and medical supplies to flow to tens of thousands of yemenis caught in the fighting .
green was speaking after the u.s. announced another $ 130 million in emergency food aid for yemen , bringing u.s. assistance to nearly $ 768 million since october 2016 .
the new funds includes nearly $ 84 million in u.s. food aid and $ 46 million in emergency disaster assistance .
unfortunately i can t tell you there has been an easing of the blockade , green told reuters .
we re trying to signal with this announcement that we re ready to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe .
green said he was deeply concerned on so many fronts about the crisis in yemen , but in particular the failure to get fuel into the country so people have access to clean water .
that means a number of communities are either without clean water or will be very shortly , and in both cases that is a terrible concern from the cholera perspective and the survival perspective , he added .
the u.n. s coordinator for yemen , jamie mcgoldrick , said on monday the blockade has been eased but the situation remained dire with some 8.4 million people a step away from famine in yemen .
a saudi-led military coalition fighting the iran-aligned houthi movement blockaded ports last month after a missile was fired toward riyadh .
washington last week warned saudi arabia that concern in congress over the humanitarian situation in yemen could affect u.s. assistance to allies in the saudi-led coalition , including the u.s. refueling of coalition jets and some intelligence sharing .
