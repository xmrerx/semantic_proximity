If you re not scared to death of the prospect of Donald Trump as President of the United States, then you re either not paying attention, or you agree with him.
And if you agree with him, then you agree with fascism and stand against freedom.Watching Trump speak is terrifyingly reminiscent of a fascist regime that tried to take over Europe in the 1930s and 40s.
A regime that, much like Trump, was against the freedom of people to worship whatever they wish to follow, silence those who were in dissent, and control all aspects of the media.If you re a Republican and supporting Trump and claim you re a lover of freedom and the Constitution you re a liar.
You clearly only want freedom for yourself and to oppress those who aren t just like you, and Trump s disdain for the freedom of speech, religion and press are palpable.Putting together a compilation of some of Trump s most horrifying moments from his rallies is the Facebook page Americans Against the Republican Party.
Even down to the most recent attack on the press from a Trump security agent who choke slammed a photojournalist who wanted to record what was going on.As the page states: He incites, encourages, and rewards violence against protesters.He has stated he would expand libel laws, tearing down the framework of the First Amendment.
In fact, he s declared a war on the First Amendment.
Donald Trump doesn t believe in the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or the freedom of the press.
It really doesn t get more clear than this, Trump is clearly in support of Fascism and we need to make sure he doesn t ever get anywhere near the White House.

Today, a reporter was slammed to the ground by his throat by Trump s security forces.
He regularly attacks the press with hateful and violent rhetoric.
He jokes, Nah, I wouldn t kill them an answer to a question that should not have to be asked.
He s stated his opinion in the past that Putin s execution of journalists in Russia shows strength.
He incites, encourages, and rewards violence against protesters.He has stated he would expand libel laws, tearing down the framework of the First Amendment.
In fact, he s declared a war on the First Amendment.
Donald Trump doesn t believe in the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or the freedom of the press.
We re never going to stop making fun of Donald Trump, but make no mistake the threat he presents to our nation and our democracy is all too serious.
Trump, and his supporters, are fascists.
When caught accidentally retweeting Mussolini, he DEFENDED Mussolini.
He s the Republican frontrunner, and all predictions say he ll be the nominee.
He s their leader.
Trump is everything the GOP stands for, even those that won t admit it.
Ignoring him isn t going to stop him.
The only thing that will is letting it be known that this kind of behavior and attitude is not going to be tolerated in our nation.
The undercurrent of racism and fear he has tapped into is strong, and our voices and votes MUST be stronger.
There is no other option.
