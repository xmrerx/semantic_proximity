sao paulo ( reuters ) - a political campaign fund set up in brazil with public money to help fight corruption is not big enough for the country s 2018 general election , the head of the country s top electoral court said on friday .
brazil s scandal-plagued political class voted on wednesday to establish the 1.7 billion reais ( $ 542 million ) fund to finance election campaigns after corporate donations were banned in the wake of the country s biggest ever corruption scandal .
backers of the fund said organized crime would step in to finance politicians if taxpayer funds were not made available .
but gilmar mendes , the head of brazil s tse electoral court , said the fund would need more money .
this is a discussion we re going to have to continue , the debate on whether there are sufficient resources .
it is evident that they will not be enough , mendes , who is also a supreme court justice , said .
the ban on corporate funding coupled with the drying up of under-the-table contributions and kickbacks during brazil s car wash corruption probe has left lawmakers struggling to raise money for their campaigns .
critics of the campaign fund said it was aimed at providing funding for lawmakers seeking re-election to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption .
mendes said one possibility to boost campaign financing next year would be to increase federal transfers to another fund that finances political parties called fundo partidario .
the current budget estimates transfers of 888 million reais to this fund in 2017 .
