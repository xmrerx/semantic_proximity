The Democrat s war on mostly ugly women Former Pennsylvania Gov.
Ed Rendell believes that Donald Trump will ultimately lose the support of women because of his past comments, arguing that there are more ugly women in the United States than attractive women.Rendell, a former two-term governor in the Keystone State, made the remarks to the Washington Post in a piece on Trump s attempt to make inroads with suburban voters, particularly in the Philadelphia suburbs.
He told the Post s Dave Weigel that for every woman he wins, he ll lose 1 1/2 or two GOP women voters.
Will he have some appeal to working-class Dems in Levittown or Bristol?
Sure, Rendell told the Post.
For every one he ll lose 1 1/2 , two Republican women.
Trump s comments like You can t be a 10 if you re flat-chested, that ll come back to haunt him.
There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women, Rendell added.
People take that stuff personally.
Wendell, also a former Democratic National Committee chairman, has long been a top surrogate for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, having supported her in her 2008 bid for the White House.
