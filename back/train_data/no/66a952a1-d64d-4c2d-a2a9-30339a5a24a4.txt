united nations ( reuters ) - a u.n. special rapporteur said on thursday there had been little change in the human rights situation in iran over the past year , voicing outrage over the harassment of journalists and adding that progress on women s rights was extremely slow .
a day after submitting her report to the world body , asma jahangir , the u.n. special rapporteur on the iran rights situation , told reporters that torture was widespread in iran and that some people were imprisoned for seeking justice .
jahangir said she had not attempted to assess the impact of sanctions on human rights in iran in her report because she had not been allowed to visit the country , which does not recognize her mandate .
iran rejected jahangir s report as biased .
the report is politically-motivated , illegitimate , rancorous and disreputable , iranian state tv channel irinn quoted foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi as saying on thursday .
iran says western countries use the issue of human rights as a political tool to apply pressure on it .
