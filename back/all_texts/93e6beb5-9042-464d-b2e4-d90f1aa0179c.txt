In a scene reminiscent of a horrifying KKK rally, a torch mob chanted highly racist slogans as they descended on a park Saturday night in Charlottesville, Virginia.The crowd claiming to protect their white heritage shouted All White Lives Matter, and No More Brother Wars, in reaction to the proposed removal of the Virginia town park s confederate statue.They were also heard chanting Russia is our friend, and You will not replace us.
The protesters also lit tiki torches as it became dark.
I m her to take part in this great celebration of our heritage and to say no to the city of Charlottesville.
You re not going to tear down our statue and you re not going to replace us, said Richard Spence, white nationalist leader.You ll remember Spence as the asshole who was punched in the face on inauguration day in D.C. Spence lead this protest which received a lot of community backlash from the same people who are against taking down the statue.
This event involving torches at night in Lee Park was either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that hearkens back to the days of the KKK, said Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer, who opposed removing the statues.Listen, Singer, if you disagree with the actions of touch-wielding racists mob, why do you oppose removing the hate-fueling racist statue?
I guess it s ok to be racists in Charlottesville as long as you re not holding a torch.Here s the video, courtesy of MSNBC:Featured Image Via Embedded Video Screengrab
