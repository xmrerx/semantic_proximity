( reuters ) - the u.s. department of labor plans to announce on wednesday its rule requiring financial advisers and brokers to act in the best interest of retirement clients when providing investment advice .
the agency first proposed a new rule in 2010 but withdrew it in 2011 after widespread criticism from financial industry officials and lawmakers .
a modified version was presented in 2015 and also met with criticism .
here are some key provisions of the final rule , according to a white house fact sheet provided on tuesday : - financial brokers must now act in clients ’ “ best interest ” when giving retirement investment advice .
that is tougher than a previous standard in which they had to ensure products were “ suitable ” for clients .
- firms must ban financial incentives for advisers not to act in the client ’ s best interest .
- firms must disclose compensation arrangements on a webpage and by making sure customers are aware of their right to all fee information .
- the rule allows firms and advisers to continue receiving the most common forms of compensation for offering investment advice to retail customers and small-plan sponsors .
the rule also does not limit the types of assets they can invest in .
- firms are allowed to sell insurance products like variable and indexed annuities under the best interest rule .
- the rule clarifies treatment of small businesses that sponsor 401 ( k ) plans , allowing brokers to sell products and services to them .
- the rule allows firms and their advisers to recommend proprietary products .
- education is not included in the definition of retirement investment advice , allowing advisers to offer basic information without acting as fiduciaries .
- under the rule , financial advisers may communicate with potential clients before signing a contract .
but firms must eventually tell new clients in writing that they are acting in their best interest , and any advice given before a contract is signed must be covered by the contract and meet the best interest standard .
- to give firms more time to adapt to changes , the rule will be implemented in phases .
full compliance is required on jan. 1 , 2018 .
