There are a lot of things people can forgive in life, but utter stupidity for lack of even remotely trying to comprehend a subject isn t one of those things.
When information is readily available to learn about something, but you simply ignore the reality of that information to go with your own moronic viewpoint because it makes more sense to you, well, you deserve to be ridiculed.Global Warming, or rather Climate Change, is very real, and there are unending facts to prove it.
Yet, there are still those who choose to ignore 97% of scientists, decades of research, and a quite visible increase in abnormal weather patterns.
One of those people is Donald Trump supporter Scott Baio.
The Happy Days star may have literally just put one of the most moronic tweets to ever exist up on his feed Sunday night.He said: Dear Global Warming, Funny, I spent 4 days in Palm Desert playing golf, getting a tan while looking at the snow on the mountains.

Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 4, 2016Okay, first of all, he clearly doesn t understand local weather patterns involving altitude and moisture let alone the ongoing climate change crisis.
Yes, when it s hot in the dry California valleys and deserts it can still be cold in the mountain regions which get more moisture and are much higher in altitude, yet still visible from the valleys and deserts.Rarely would I dub someone so clearly and utterly moronic, but this seems to be well worthy of the condemnation.
We already knew he was pretty dumb for supporting Trump, but this takes the cake.Featured Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Clear Channel
