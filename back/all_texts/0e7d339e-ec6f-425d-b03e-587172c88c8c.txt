Monday marked the all-important Iowa caucuses, and every candidate on the right is busily competing for the votes of as many religious bigots as possible.
One such candidate was, of course, Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
He also had his celebrity supporters helping him along, and one such person was Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson, who likely enjoyed his role in Cruz s Iowa efforts, as it allowed him to do what he loves to do most: hate on gay people in public.Today s topic for Robertson was the evils of allowing two people who love each other but happen to be of the same sex to get married.
Robertson said of equal marriage: It is evil, it s wicked, it s sinful and they want us to swallow it.
He wasn t done there, though.
He went on to actually attack any and all people, particularly politicians, who support equal rights for everyone: We have to run this bunch out of Washington D.C. We have to rid the earth of them.
Get them out of there.
When it was time for Cruz himself to appear before the crowd, he actually endorsed the idea of purging the planet of all who disagree with him and his bearded supporter on this particular issue, and called Robertson a joyful, cheerful, unapologetic voice of truth.
So, in other words, these people are actually insinuating that a whole population of people and their supporters should actually die.
Sounds eerily close to what Hitler would have done to me.Watch Robertson s remarks below, via Right Wing Watch: Featured image from video screen capture from Right Wing Watch
