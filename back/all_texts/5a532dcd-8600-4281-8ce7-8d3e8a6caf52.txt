While Facebook has hired an entire team of employees to weed out fake news , their crack-team of censorship stooges consider news sources like the New York Times to the be the gold standard for the industry The New York Times published an almost 1300-word news story on Monday night about Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez s corruption trial, without ever mentioning Menendez s party affiliation.Both in print and on social media, the NYT failed to inform its readers that Sen. Menendez is a Democrat.
For the first time in 36 years, a sitting United States Senator is facing a federal bribery trial, read a NYT tweet promoting the story, which was titled: Menendez Trial Set to Begin With Tensions High and Washington Watching.
The NYT wasn t without opportunities to inform its readers which party Menendez belonged to: the paper referred to Menendez 29 times in the story, without once ever mentioning that Menendez is a Democrat.The paper referred to him as The senator, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Mr. Menendez, a senior senator, before referring to him as Mr. Menendez or the senator for the rest of the story.
Only after a barrage of online criticism did the NYT note that Menendez is a Democrat, adding in the identifier in the fourth paragraph.
