We re only two months into Trump s failing presidency, and even the Republican Party wants nothing more than to see the end of it.
What s even more surprising, is that many of the party s most prominent members are doing very little to hide their feelings and disappointment.Earlier today, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) took the opportunity to grill Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch during his confirmation hearing.
Graham has been a major critic of Trump since his presidential campaign, and he made sure to insult Trump on his stance on torture practices while questioning Gorsuch.
Sending a warning to Trump about his stance on waterboarding in particular, Graham said to Gorsuch: You have said several times he is not above the law.
So if we have laws on the book that prevent waterboarding do you agree with me that the Detainee Treatment Act prevents waterboarding?
Under the Detainee Treatment Act, waterboarding is illegal and yet, Trump has blatantly stated during his campaign that he doesn t believe waterboarding is a torture method.
He has previously said in several different interviews that waterboarding absolutely works and claims it is just short of torture.
Graham then followed his question to Gorsuch up with this statement, which sounded much like a promise and a threat to Trump: In case President Trump is watching if you start waterboarding, you may be impeached.
Gorsuch s response made it perfectly clear that he was in agreement with Graham.
He said: Senator, the impeachment power belongs to this body.
No man is above the law.
You can watch Graham send this shocking message to Trump below:There have never been more reasons to impeach a president, and now even Republicans are beginning to recognize that this man does not belong in the White House.Featured image via screenshot
