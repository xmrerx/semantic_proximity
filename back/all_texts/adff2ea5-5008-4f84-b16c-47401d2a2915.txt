Saturday night s debate saw Donald Trump and Ted Cruz going at each other repeatedly.
More specifically, it saw them calling one another liars.
Now, Trump has gone on record saying that Cruz is the biggest liar he s ever known.
In fact, Trump seems to believe that these alleged lies on the part of Ted Cruz is enough to bring a lawsuit against the Texas Senator.
Watch Trump seem to lose his mind as he repeats the same line over and over like a crazy parrot: So we will bring a lawsuit if he doesn t straighten his act out.
He s a lying guy, a really lying guy.
Some people misrepresent.
This guy s just a plain out liar.
In fact, I felt better because Marco Rubio called him a liar the other night on stage.
I felt so much better.
I said good, politician calls a politician?
Now I can actually call him a liar.
Well considering that Donald Trump has a pretty tenuous relationship with the truth himself, this isn t really saying a whole lot.
That whole field of GOP clowns lies through their teeth for sport, so it s really just hypocrisy at its finest.
But hey, at least it s great for entertainment.Watch the video below, as posted to Facebook by Fox News:// < !
