nairobi ( reuters ) - an outbreak of plague has killed 20 people in the space of a month in madagascar , with a further 84 infected , the world health organisation ( who ) said on friday .
plague is mainly spread by flea-carrying rats .
humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague , which swells lymph nodes and can be treated with antibiotics .
but the more dangerous pneumonic form invades the lungs and can kill a person within 24 hours if not treated .
about half of the 104 known cases are pneumonic , the who said .
who spokesman tarik jasarevic told reporters in geneva that areas affected included the capital antananarivo and the port cities of mahajenga and toamasina .
the u.n. health agency said it feared that the outbreak could worsen because the season for plague , which is endemic in madagascar , had only just begun , and runs until april .
on average , 400 cases are reported each year .
the overall risk of further spread at the national level is high , who said in a statement .
