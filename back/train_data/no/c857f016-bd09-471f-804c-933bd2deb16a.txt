berlin ( reuters ) - chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday donald trump must be shown appropriate respect for holding the office of the u.s. president , even if she may differ with him on policy issues .
merkel , campaigning for a fourth term in office after a sept. 24 national election , has refused to bend to pressure from her social democrat ( spd ) rivals to resist demands by trump for nato members to increase their defense spending .
as a committed atlanticist , she has stressed the strength of german relations with the united states even when flagging differences in opinion on policy .
if you take the president of the united states , whatever differences of opinion there may be , i know he prevailed in a tough election .
it wasn t reserved for him on a silver platter , she told business daily handelsblatt in an interview .
in the end , he won the election under american electoral law and that means he is democratically elected and that this person should be shown the appropriate respect , regardless of how i assess his views , she added .
her spd challenger , martin schulz , has been far more critical of trump , referring to the u.s. president as this irresponsible man in the white house .
merkel , who enjoyed holidaying in the united states before becoming chancellor in 2005 , said she missed the opportunity to vacation there now .
i can t go on holiday in san diego now as chancellor because the time difference is too much , and that is something i miss a bit , but the work itself is so marvelous that i can afford to miss it .
