dar es salaam ( reuters ) - tanzania s government has closed a critical newspaper for the second time in three months , banning the weekly mwanahalisi for two years after accusing it of inciting violence .
another newspaper mawio was banned in june over articles it published linking two former presidents to alleged improprieties in mining deals signed in the 1990s and early 2000s .
the moves appear to cement president john magufuli s pledge in january that the days of newspapers his government viewed as unethical were numbered a statement that triggered concerns about censorship .
the government has suspended publication and circulation of the weekly mwanahalisi newspaper for 24 months ... due to repeated unethical reporting , publishing fabricated and inciting articles and endangering national security , the state-run tanzania information services said in a statement .
the body said mwanahalisi published a series of inciteful articles about magafuli and that its editors had refused to apologize for their reporting .
magufuli , nicknamed the bulldozer , has won some praise from western donors for an anti-corruption drive and cutting wasteful public spending .
but opponents accuse him of increasingly undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech .
tanzania has one of the most highly diverse media industries in africa , with over 450 registered newspapers and journals , as well as 180 radio and television stations .
in november , magufuli signed into law a bill that journalists said was aimed at muzzling freedom of the press .
the media services act of 2016 gives officials powers to shut down media organizations that violate their licenses and requires newspapers to apply for an annual license .
