Saturday Night Live is back with new episodes, and this week s cold open did not disappoint.
As the iconic show went live coast-to-coast for the first time in history, they went all in on the incompetence of The Donald s reality show presidency.
Alec Baldwin returned as the reliably buffoonish Trump, and Jimmy Fallon played the notoriously silent son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kusher.
To round off the spoof, the Grim Reaper returned as the newly diminished Steve Bannon.
There was even a cameo by Mike Pence, played by Beck Bennett, where the show ruthlessly mocked reports that Pence actually calls his wife mother.
In the spoof, Baldwin s Trump is doing a reality-show style elimination round to finally end the Kushner vs. Bannon feud that has been irritating him and amusing the rest of us for weeks now.
He starts out by saying that he is holding a photo of each adviser, and only one will get to stay.
Trump praises Kushner for being photogenic, while telling Bannon that pictures of him make him want to puke.
In the end, Kushner is chosen, and another Grim Reaper-like figure comes to take Bannon to hell.
After that, SNL kicked off what is sure to be a successful President Kushner narrative, as they have Trump tell Kushner to sit at the president s desk in the Oval Office, while Trump himself returns to the child s desk to play with his toys, just as he did in previous episodes with President Bannon.
All in all, SNL outdid themselves with this one.
