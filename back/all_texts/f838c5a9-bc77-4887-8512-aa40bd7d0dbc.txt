After Donald Trump s Saturday morning tweetstorm, we have no choice but to wonder what, exactly, he is worried about.
Ever since the pee pee dossier was originally released, we have seen Trump s ravings evolve from complaints about FAKE NEWS to demands that the ILLEGAL LEAKS stop.
On Saturday, The Donald expanded on his at times incomprehensible ravings by blaming Obama for people learning about his and his campaign s illicit activities involving Russian oligarchs.Terrible!
Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.
Nothing found.
This is McCarthyism!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017This isn t McCarthyism.
While Trump did not provide any evidence of his claim, it was well known by intelligence agencies rather early in 2016.
Trump even publicly asked the dictator of a hostile foreign power to hack his political opponents.
It s only natural for our intelligence agencies to want to look into that.Saying nothing of the evidence that has been uncovered that his team kept in constant contact with high-ranking Russian officials during the campaign, Trump demanded to know if it is legal for our intelligence agencies to investigate someone who is openly colluding with Vladimir Putin against the interests of the American people:Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election?
Turned down by court earlier.
A NEW LOW!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Then, he threatened to go after President Obama in court because our intelligence agencies did their jobs:I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump didn t quite explain his next tweet, but he is more right than he knows about part of it.
How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.
This is Nixon/Watergate.
Bad (or sick) guy!
President Asterisk whined.This is, indeed, very much like Nixon/Watergate in that Nixon was guilty and did quite a bit of public flailing before the investigation into his crimes was complete.
But it seems that Trump was saying that Nixon, like himself, was innocent and that President Obama was sick for allegedly authorizing wiretaps against such a pristine example of a human being as Trump.Naturally, Americans were all over this one:.
@Mike_P_Williams this is truly staggering.
He seems paranoid.

@realDonaldTrump This is Nixon/Watergate, if by that you mean you'll be impeached and resign in disgrace.
Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Hopefully your presidency ends like Nixon/Watergate.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump you're the next Nixon dude.
You're an embarrassment for our great nation.
A traitor to real Americans.
You should resign ?
(@VeeVee) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump How long before you illegally delete this (supposedly) archived tweet?
#TheResistance (@AynRandPaulRyan) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump You've been tweeting paranoid, unsubstantiated, unproven crap for an hour.
WHO IS DRIVING AMERICA?
craig stone (@craigstone_) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Your attempt to spin a situation in which your staff broke laws by communicating with Russian spies is ludicrous!!!!
Stephen Robert Morse (@morsels) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump FOUR tweets now about this wire tap story and still no specifics Starting to think you re reading conspiracy blogs.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 4, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump he didn't NEED to tap anything, you're always on here spilling your guts.
Also, Nixon was guilty, rather like yourself.
Jane Slavin (@JaneSlavin) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump and you are Nixon?
You know how that ends?
???
Don't lie to your country or obstruct justice!
Jose Andrade (@jandrade) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Nope.
You are worse than Nixon, and this fiasco is worse than Watergate.
Andrea Kuszewski (@AndreaKuszewski) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Tweeting doesn t seem like the right way to level charges like these on a former President unless they are nonsense.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump even for you this is fucking embarrassing.
Michael Beveridge (@mickyb273) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Is this going to be another Obama isn t an American citizen until it s politically convenient to admit YOU WERE WRONG?
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Did he go so low as to collude with a foreign power to get himself elected?
Raoul Binderschmidt (@Skeletor_Jesus) March 4, 2017Ironically, last year it was revealed that Trump had a special console next to his bed at the Mar-A-Lago that allowed him to spy on guests phone conversations.
Though Trump denied it, numerous former staffers confirmed that the billionaire did, indeed, spy on guests.
Unlike the possibility that our intelligence agencies did tapp Trump s phone during the campaign with good reason this would be a crime.
It is illegal in Florida to intercept or record phone calls without the consent of everyone involved in the conversation.Hopefully, Trump is right that this is like Nixon/Watergate.
We all know how that ended.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab
