If you happened to miss Lady Gaga give the national anthem before kick-off at Super Bowl 50, you missed one of the most spectacular national anthems in recent history, probably the best ever.
Some are saying she did better than Whitney Houston, even.
In any case, no matter how well you rate her performance it was certainly up there.
She absolutely slayed it, making it her own, and that s no understatement.If you don t already know, Lady Gaga has been a long time advocate of gay rights.
The Queen of Twitter had everyone in an uproar after hearing her performance and for all it s worth, the only people who hated it, are, you guessed it, anti-gay homophobes.
They couldn t stand it!#WATCH: Lady Gaga s full performance/rendition of the National Anthem at the #SuperBowl??
