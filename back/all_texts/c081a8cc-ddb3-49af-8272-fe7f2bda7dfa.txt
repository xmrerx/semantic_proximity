Dead broke!
yes, that another doozy that Hillary told about their post White House life.
But Clinton grifters are breaking into the Cristal champagne to celebrate another Clinton spawn.
Oh joy!
If this is dead broke then I think I d like to be dead broke too!Bill and Hillary Clinton celebrated news of their second grandchild at 21, where spies said Bill asked the ma tre d to unearth a bottle of bubbly the couple left there to chill in 1997.We re told the Clintons arrived at the storied restaurant with daughter Chelsea, son-in-law Marc Mezvinsky and Marc s parents on Monday the night before Chelsea tweeted that she s expecting her second child.A regular at 21 told Page Six, The Clintons asked [general manager] Teddy Suric to go to the wine cellar and check on a magnum of Cristal from 1997, when Chelsea was 17.
They d said, Keep it on ice for when we come back!
They were ready for the bubbly 18 years later.Via: NYP
