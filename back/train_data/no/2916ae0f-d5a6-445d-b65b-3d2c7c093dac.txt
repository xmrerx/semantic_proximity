rep. maxine waters said today that if robert mueller does his job and is able to prove collusion between president donald trump s campaign and the russians , then we ve got him .
in an interview with msnbc host and self-professed waters fan joy reid , waters reiterated that democrats needed to work to remove trump from office .
reid asked waters if she had a sense that more republicans in congress were willing to stand up to trump.waters said she felt some republicans did not know how to handle the situation or were simply waiting for the president to implode .
many of them are not comfortable , and i believe that if mueller does his job , if he s able to connect the dots , if he s able to show collusion , then we ve got him , she said .
they will move away from him .
waters , a darling of progressives due to her constant calls for trump s impeachment , has previously likened mueller s investigation of russian interference in the 2016 election to a contest of sorts .
in an appearance friday on msnbc , she said mueller is going to win .
trump has consistently stated the mueller probe is a witch hunt and pointed to the partisanship of the investigators on his team , although other republicans have said mueller s reputation is unquestioned.on the view last week , waters said she welcomed the leaks coming from trump s white house and was so glad they re telling us what s going on .
