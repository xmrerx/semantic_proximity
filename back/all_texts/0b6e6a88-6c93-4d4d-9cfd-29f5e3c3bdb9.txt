TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may have won a major election victory on Sunday, but half the people surveyed post-election by the Asahi newspaper don t want him to stay prime minister.
It seems the election victory has boosted the approval rating for Abe s administration, but not him.
Public support rate for Abe s administration grew to 42 percent in the survey, conducted between Oct. 23 and 24, up from 38 percent in its previous survey in mid-Oct.
But 47 percent of respondents don t want Abe to continue as prime minister, exceeding 37 percent who want him to stay, said the survey published on Wednesday.
Abe s disapproval rating slipped to 39 percent from 40 percent, according to the Asahi s survey.
Abe is due to remain prime minister until September 2018 when his tenure as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader ends and a new vote for LDP leader is held Abe s LDP-led coalition won a combined 313 seats in Sunday s national election, keeping its two-thirds super majority in the 465-member lower house, local media said.
Several experts noted the ruling bloc s win was less a victory for the long-ruling LDP than a defeat for a divided opposition.
The Asahi s survey also showed 51 percent of respondents said the number of seats the ruling bloc s won was too many , while 32 percent expressed the seat number was good.
And 54 percent of respondents said they were concerned about Abe s policies, exceeding 29 percent who said they have positive expectations, the Asahi said.
A Yomiuri newspaper survey on Wednesday showed the approval rating for Abe s administration was up at 52 percent from 41 percent in its previous survey early this month.
Asked reasons for the LDP s winning majority on its own, only six percent said it was high hopes for Abe , 10 percent said appreciation of ruling parties achievements while 44 percent cited fragmentation of opposition, the Yomiuri said.
