new delhi ( reuters ) - india has issued new norms barring unruly passengers from flying for a minimum of three months to more than two years depending on the nature of the misdemeanor , the government said on friday .
the federal government has issued a no-fly list of unruly passengers after a lawmaker admitted assaulting an official from state-owned carrier air india .
the new rules will be applicable to foreign carriers as well , the government said in a statement , adding that unruly behavior has been categorized in three levels - verbal , physical and life threatening .
the concept of no-fly is based on safety of other passengers , crew and the aircraft , and not just on the security threat , the government said .
