Donald Trump was involved at the highest levels in a cozy real estate deal that allowed $20 million in taxes owed to the federal government to go uncollected.
The revelation comes as Trump still refuses to disclose his income taxes even as it emerged that years ago he paid no taxes, despite being a multi-millionaire (he claims to be a billionaire, but there is no independent proof of that).Trump s machinations were revealed by the British newspaper The Telegraph.The billionaire approved a $50 million investment in a company only for the deal to be rewritten several weeks later as a loan .Experts say that the effect of this move was to skirt vast tax liabilities, and court papers seen by the Telegraph allege that the deal amounted to fraud.Independent tax accountants and lawyers said that the documents Mr Trump signed copies of which were obtained by this newspaper as part of a three-month investigation contained red flags indicating the deal was irregular.The paper has also obtained the document making the deal, including Trump s one, unique signature.Kack Blum, chairman of the Tax Justice Network and a financial crime attorney told the paper that Trump is the poster child for elites that avoid their taxes, while the burden to make up the shortfall in revenue falls on the shoulders of middle-class Americans.Under New York law, up to 40 percent in taxes should have been paid on the deal if it went through as a traditional transaction.
But since Trump was able to get the transfer of funds classified as a loan, taxes were completely avoided.
Former employees of the company Trump was involved in, Bayrock, said that $20 million in taxes went uncollected.A professor of law and director of tax at the University of San Diego told the Telegraph that the he doesn t think the deal signed by Trump would survive a challenge by the IRS.Featured image via The Telegraph
