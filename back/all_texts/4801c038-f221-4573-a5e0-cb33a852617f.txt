HARARE (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters seeking to remove Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe from office heeded a call from a leader of the powerful liberation war veterans on Saturday to march on the 93-year-old s residence in the capital.
Let us now go and deliver the message that grandfather Mugabe and his typist-cum-wife should go home, war veterans secretary-general Victor Matemadanda told an anti-Mugabe rally in the Harare township of Highfield.
As he spoke, people started leaving the rally to head towards Mugabe s lavish Blue Roof residence, live television pictures showed.
