As the Donald Trump campaign shows signs of going broke, it s no surprise as to why: instead of paying staffers, building a political machine and reaching out to voters, Trump is using the measly dollars his campaign collects to pay himself and his businesses.
The money has even gone to his personal entities, including his jet plane and his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.In total, Trump has paid himself over $1.4 million.While Trump continues to paint himself as the champion and savior of the middle class, Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, reminds people that Trump is only in this for himself, his image, and his brand nothing else:What is Trump spending his meager campaign resources on?
Why, himself, of course.
https://t.co/6LsNwf4gTL Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 21, 2016While conservatives and liberals accuse Clinton of being beholden to money, it s good to remember that there s nothing illegal about this.
Clinton does it too, and so does every other candidate with any of their own businesses that provide even the smallest service to their campaign, because the law requires them to pay for it, even if the candidate owns 100% of that business.
What makes Trump different from Clinton and anyone else doing this is the sheer amount of money he s paid himself and how much he does it.
He s not following the law like Clinton, he s bending and manipulating it.As Clinton calls it, Trump s meager campaign resources aren t being used to actually win a presidential election.
This is all a charade for the billionaire mogul, who recently went on the record saying he d drop out of the race if someone offered him $5 billion.
That s how much the presidency is worth to him.
It s a game, and it s all about money.While Clinton gets endorsements from unions that represent millions of blue collar workers, Trump continues to line his pockets with the money of the people he s pretending to care about.Featured image via Angelo Merendino/Getty Images
