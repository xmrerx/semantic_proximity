There s been news erupting all over the place regarding what guests Donald Trump will be inviting to the last presidential debate.
So far, we know he s bringing in the mom of a Benghazi victim, and President Obama s half-brother.
Random, we know.Well, it seems as if the circus is about to get a new performer, because word just came in that Trump has invited someone else as well.NBC News correspondent Hallie Jackson let us all in on a little secret, and that is that Trump has invited none other than former half-term governor and failed reality TV star Sarah Palin to be his guest at the debate.So: Trump source tells me @SarahPalinUSA is an invited guest to tonight's #debate.

He s down by double digits in national polls, and many notoriously red states have the very real possibility of turning blue this year.He s either being this ridiculous on purpose just to give comedy writers material, or he really is just that crazy.
My guess in the latter.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle via Getty Images
