comedian mark dice explores the influence so-called comedians have on their viewers when it comes to pushing their political views on fans .
as part of his example , dice shows his viewers a clip from a 1980 interview with leftist comedian chevy chase .
chase is not only unapologetic for using his position as a writer for snl to push his liberal propaganda down the throats of unsuspecting viewers , he s actually quite arrogant about the power he believed he had over his fans on snl.in the 1980 interview with cnn , chevy chase admits to using his position to affect the outcomes of the gerald ford jimmy carter election .
chase admits to wanting to take down gerald ford and to promote jimmy carter : i just went after him [ ford ] .
and uh i certainly , and obviously my leanings were democratic and i wanted carter in and i wanted him out .
and i figured look , we re reaching millions of people uh .. every weekend , so why not do it ?
the cnn reporter seems stunned by chase s admission asks , wait a minute !
you mean to tell me that in the back of your mind you were thinking , hey i want carter and i m gon na make him [ ford ] look bad ?
chase , who seemed very pleased with his arrogant self bragged , oh yeah !
