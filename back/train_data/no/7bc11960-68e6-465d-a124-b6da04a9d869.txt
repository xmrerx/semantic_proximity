mexico city ( reuters ) - at least 13 people were killed in battles between rival gangs in two states in central and western mexico , officials said on wednesday , as murders climb to record levels this year .
five people were gunned down in a bar on tuesday night in the capital of central guanajuato state while seven people were found dead in two different places in the western state of michoacan , according to officials at state prosecutors offices .
three dismembered bodies , including a woman s , were found in the community of angahuan near the drug-gang hotbed of uruapan , the michoacan prosecutors office said .
michoacan has been one of the bloodiest states in mexico because of battles between rival gangs involved in drug trafficking , kidnapping , extortion of local businesses as well as mineral theft and illegal logging .
neighboring guanajuato state has seen a spike in violence .
murders were up 37 percent in guanajuato in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period last year .
the murder rate has already risen above levels seen in 2011 , which was the deadliest year under former president felipe calderon who sent the army out to battle drug gangs .
nationally , there were 14,190 murder investigations in the first seven months of the year , the highest total through july for any year in records going back to 1997 .
the increase in violence has hit the popularity of president enrique pena nieto and his institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) ahead of next year s presidential election .
