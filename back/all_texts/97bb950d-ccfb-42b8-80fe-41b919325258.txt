MADRID (Reuters) - Most public buildings that were intended to be used as polling stations in Sunday s disputed referendum on Catalan independence have been closed, Spain s Interior Ministry said on Saturday.
Only some potential voting stations were being occupied by people bent on obstructing police efforts to enforce a court order barring public buildings from being used for Sunday s planned vote, the ministry said in a statement.
