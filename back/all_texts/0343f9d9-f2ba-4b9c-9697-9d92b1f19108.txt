Adbusters latest magazine cover definitely lives up to its mission of fighting back against the hostile takeover of our psychological, physical and cultural environments by commercial forces.
The cover, which has Trump s face plastered across the entire page, has made very creative use of its bar code and Trump s head for a cover story about global fascism and Trump is NOT going to be happy about it.
Really, nothing could have been more appropriate:TwitterThis could be a jab at Trump for the anti-Semitic memes he got in trouble for a few months ago, or a statement about his overall leadership style as more of a dictator than a President.
Either way, the magazine was dead on in calling Trump out for his divisive, inflammatory statements and proposals.With The Donald boasting a bar code mustache meant to represent the facial hair of Adolf Hitler, Adbusters has hit the nail on the head.
The magazine s editorial says Adbusters Issue #127 takes on the rise of global fascism, exposing the symptoms of a sick and outdated system by looking at cyber threats, political activism and the current Fascist mood dominating Eastern Europe.
The magazine explains: Everywhere you look, fascist tendencies are creeping into view as each day our world falls further and further into chaos.
Have we forgotten the lessons of the past?
Will we bury our heads into the comforts of virtual reality while egomaniacs capture the imagination of the masses?
Cool Fascismo is an unprecedented exploration into a world where a culture of cool becomes a culture of fear.
If that doesn t describe Trump perfectly, I don t know what does.
We re waiting to see what Trump himself has to say about the new Adbusters cover, but there s a good chance it ll be a tweet about the magazine being dishonest, struggling and SAD!
