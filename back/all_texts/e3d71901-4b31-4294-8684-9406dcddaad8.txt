During a campaign stop, Republican primary candidate Ted Cruz was confronted with the most well-known troll in United States politics.
In case you are not in on the joke, Vermin Supreme runs in every presidential election.
He is a performance artist who pulls stunts that satirize the U.S. election system.The confrontation was hilarious, to say the least.
Supreme and a group of his supporters ambushed Cruz, who was standing outside his campaign bus.
They swarmed Cruz, carrying handmade Vermin Supreme 2016 signs.
Shouting into a megaphone, Supreme asks Cruz: Ted Cruz, do you agree that the waterboarding water should be fluoridated?
Shouldn t we at least fluoridate the water that we use to water board the bad people with?
That s Supreme s act in a nutshell.
He makes completely ridiculous comments about either real issues or fictional ones.
Supreme rose to fame instantly when a video was published online that showed him campaigning on the promise that if he is elected, everyone will get a free pony.Obviously not knowing what the heck is going on, Cruz flees to the safety of his campaign bus.
Once inside Supreme shouts into the megaphone towards the bus: Surrender, Ted Cruz, surrender.
We have you surrounded.
You must surrender immediately.
Put your hands in the air and drop your pants for your safety, thank you.
Mr. Cruz, why do you hate America?
Sir, why do you hate America?
Taking shots at both Cruz s religious zealotry and his hawkish foreign policy platform, Supreme concludes the protest/campaign event/performance piece by holding a prayer.
Supreme prays that: That, uh, we don t get into any wars, and the war that we do get into against Narnia, that there will not be very many American causalities.
The video of the encounter was posted to Twitter.
