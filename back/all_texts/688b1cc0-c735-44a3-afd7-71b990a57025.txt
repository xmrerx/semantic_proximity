The creator of Family Guy responded on Sunday to the Orlando mass shooting and humiliated a couple of gun nuts along the way.On Saturday, a gunman killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Florida.
It is now the worst mass shooting in American history and has reignited the calls for gun safety regulations.And comedian Seth MacFarlane added his voice to those making such calls by calling for a ban on automatic weapons in a post on Twitter.
These shootings are a regular occurrence, MacFarlane wrote.
You don t get to be shocked anymore unless you take action to stop them.
Ban automatic weapons.

Ban automatic weapons.
Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016Of course, a couple gun nuts took issue with MacFarlane s call to action.One Twitter user claimed that MacFarlane s call to ban automatic weapons would be like banning planes after the 9/11 attacks.
The voice of Peter Griffin responded that unlike guns, planes aren t designed to kill people.
RT @JIMDETHOMAS: @SethMacFarlane should ve banned planes after 9/11.
// A plane s primary function is not to kill.
Get the difference?
Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016A second gun nut posted the dubious conservative claim that if a single person had been carrying a gun that night less people would have been killed.
MacFarlane responded with the fact that there hasn t been a single example of a good guy with a gun preventing a mass shooting in progress.RT @xNathan30x: one person carrying a concealed handgun in that club could have ended that horror.
// Often stated, never once happened.
Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016In the end, MacFarlane lamented that all the responses, presumably the negative ones, are enough to cause even him to be depressed.
Man.
Twitter responses to all this on my feed are enough to send the even cheeriest soul into a deep depression.
Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016Banning automatic weapons is not the only way to reduce gun violence.
We need a better background check system and we need to ban people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy guns.
Plus, we desperately need better mental healthcare in this country.
But Republicans in Congress refuse to do anything that will upset their NRA masters, and that s why we can expect more mass shootings unless we send people to Congress who will take action to prevent gun violence instead of simply offering useless thoughts and prayers.Featured image via Wikimedia
