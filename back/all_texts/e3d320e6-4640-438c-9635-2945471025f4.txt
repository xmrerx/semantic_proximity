There are conflicting reports about why the outrageous Omarosa Manigault Newman is leaving her undefined job at the White House.
It was first reported that she was escorted out of the White House by Secret Service after General Kelly had enough of her nonsense, and fired her.
Omarosa appeared on Good Morning America the following day to refute those claims, saying she resigned from her job and was not fired or escorted out of the White House as reported.
So who is Omarosa, and why is she such a polarizing figure?
Does this 2006 video that just emerged offer any clues?A pop-culture polymath sent Page Six a link to Soul Sistahs, an ultra-camp, hyper-kitsch, uber-low-budget 10-minute sci-fi short film.While the plot is virtually incomprehensible, as far as we can tell it focuses on an intergalactic yenta in a housecoat who kidnaps Omarosa in an attempt to steal Donald Trump s hair as part of a difficult-to-understand get-rich-quick scheme.The mini-flick was made back in 2006 two years after Omarosa shot to fame on Trump s NBC show The Apprentice.
In this vaguely Barbarella -inspired work, the aging villain drugs Omarosa by feeding her spiked cake, whereupon the red PVC-clad former director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison goes off on a motorcycle to steal the future president s hair in a showdown on top of a CGI-created Trump Tower.The film, which has been viewed a mere 6,000 times as our source put it: It s a cult classic.
I m the cult was made by former In Touch Weekly photo director Michael Todd, tabloid veteran Matt Coppa and his brother Andrew Coppa.
