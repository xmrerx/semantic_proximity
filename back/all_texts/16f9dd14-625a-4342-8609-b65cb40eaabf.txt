Former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL.
Sansaricq exposes all of the dirty dealings of the Clinton s in Haiti while he was still in office.
Donald Trump to his credit, allowed him to speak his mind and expose to the world what kind of criminals are attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.Sansaricq also claims he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti.
His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to side with the Clinton Administration and he would be the richest man in Haiti.
He also suggests that Hillary Clinton disclose the audit of all money related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claims they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.
Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti.
So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake.
Haiti is a very poor country.
Haiti needs defenders.
You said you would champion our cause.
We welcome you sir and we will work with you.
Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.
Watch this stunning confession of bribery, and threats during the Clinton presidency when Bill tried to oust the regime in Haiti.
