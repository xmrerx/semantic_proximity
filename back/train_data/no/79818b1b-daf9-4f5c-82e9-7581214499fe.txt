don t you just love the absolute boldness of the mexican government in this move to charge people coming across their border in tijuana ?
unreal ! walking into mexico at the nation s busiest border crossing with the united states is no longer an uninterrupted stroll for foreigners.starting late wednesday , pedestrians going to tijuana from san diego at the san ysidro crossing must choose between a line for mexicans who get waved through , and a line for foreigners who must show a passport , fill out a form and if staying more than a week pay 322 pesos , or roughly $ 20 , for a six-month permit.about a dozen foreigners stood in line wednesday night , directed by english-speaking agents to six inspection booths where they got passports stamped .
it took about 10 minutes from start to finish.travelers have long followed similar protocol at mexican airports , but the new border procedure marks a big change at land crossings that weren t designed to question everyone .
pedestrians and motorists have generally entered mexico unencumbered along the 1,954-mile border with the united states .
this is about putting our house in order , said rodulfo figueroa , mexico s top immigration official in baja california state , which includes tijuana .
