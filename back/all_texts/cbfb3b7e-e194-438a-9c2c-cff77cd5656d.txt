Walmart s back to school advertising took a pretty horrible turn at a location in Evansville, Indiana.The big box chain has never been apologetic about its incessant need to make guns readily available to customers, but many felt the store went too far with a Back to School display encouraging kids to Own the school year like a hero.

It s the color of the backdrop.
The lighter blue clashes with everything in the photo, especially the gigantic display case of guns.For any thinking person viewing the display, it serves as a reminder of the school shootings that regularly plague our nation thanks to the NRA and Republicans resistance to any form of sensible gun control.To Republicans, guns should just be in school anyway.Walmart still refuses to say a word about the easy availability of guns.

We are very sorry.
