Adolf Hitler isn t enthused about being compared to Republican front runner Donald Trump, according to comedian Sarah Silverman, who dressed up as the Nazi dictator and made an appearance on Conan.
After being introduced, Silverman-as-Hitler said: Wow, look at that!
I have to say, that s more applause than I expected.
Don t get me wrong, Conan.
I agree with a lot he says a lot.
Like 90 percent of what he says, I m like, this guy gets it, but I don t like the way he says it.
It s crass.
In reference to a recent GOP debate when Rubio poked fun of Trump s hands and implicitly referred to the size of his penis, Silverman-as-Hitler had this to say: What kind of person talks about his penis size on national television?
Oh yeah, I m so sure Donald Trump has a big penis.
I famously have a micro penis.
That s what makes a tyrant.
Anyway, all these comparisons to Trump, it s like, it bums me out.
You know what I mean?
Sometimes I watch him and I m like, Is that how people see me?'
Watch the clip here:Trump has received a barrage of criticism, some comparing him to the notorious dictator including Louis CK, who said, he is dangerous.
Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto said Trump s campaign had similarities to the rise of the Nazi leader.In an interview with Good Morning America, Trump said of the comparisons:It s a terrible comparison.
I m not happy about that, certainly.
I don t want that comparison.
But you know we have to be strong, and we have to be vigilant.
People agree with that.
We don t want to lose our jobs to China.
And we don t want to lose our jobs to Mexico and Japan, If Trump doesn t want such comparisons, then he should stop propagating in ways that remind the world of the notorious Nazi dictator.
