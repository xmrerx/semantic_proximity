Monty Python s John Cleese owned two idiots on Sunday.
One of them was Donald Trump.
The other was a Trump supporter.
And it was hilarious.On Saturday, terrorists struck in London and killed seven people.
So, of course, Trump responded by posting divisive and fear mongering messages on Twitter in order to push for his pro-gun agenda and his travel ban.We need to be smart, vigilant and tough.
We need the courts to give us back our rights.
We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people.
If we don t get smart it will only get worse Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is no reason to be alarmed!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now?
That s because they used knives and a truck!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017That s right.
Trump actually used this tragedy to push his own agenda and then had the gall to attack London s mayor as the city continues to deal with the aftermath.Well, legendary actor and comedian John Cleese responded to Trump this afternoon by calling out Trump s stupidity.Seeing Trump s recent London tweet reminds me of the 9th Beatitude : Blessed are the stupid, for their confidence makes them so easy to spot John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 4, 2017And shortly after Cleese posted, a confident Trump fan made his point for him for the whole world to see.You re wrong.
He s right.
Adrian Wachowiak (@nurniflowenola) June 4, 2017It didn t take long for Cleese to proceed with the public humiliation.Thank you for explaining it so wellSorry for my mistake !
!Seriously Re-read what I said.
It s about you https://t.co/k07KpFqtbz John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 4, 2017Once again, John Cleese runs circles around Trump and his pathetically ignorant supporters.Featured image via Molly Riley-Pool/Getty Images
