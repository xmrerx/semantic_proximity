beirut ( reuters ) - tahrir al-sham , an alliance of jihadist factions in syria , on saturday decried turkey-backed syrian rebel factions planning an operation in the northwestern idlib province where it dominates , saying it would not be a picnic for them .
the lions of jihad and martyrdom are waiting to pounce on them , it added in a statement posted on a social media site .
earlier on saturday turkish president tayyip erdogan said syrian rebel fighters were preparing to launch a serious operation in idlib backed by turkish forces from inside turkey s borders .
the operation comes after an agreement last month between turkey , russia and iran to set up a de-escalation zone in northwest syria where idlib is located to reduce warfare there .
erdogan said russia , which backs the syrian government against rebel groups , would support the operation , but rebels taking part said russia s role was only in areas controlled by the syrian government .
tahrir al-sham s statement described the rebel groups involved as traitors , accusing them of working with russia and the syrian government , but without mentioning turkey .
