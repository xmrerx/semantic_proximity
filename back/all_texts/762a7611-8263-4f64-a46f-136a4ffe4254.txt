In the simplest of terms, one way to describe Donald Trump supporters would be to call them interesting.
However, not interesting in a way where they have profound things to say and should be respected for all the things they do, but rather interesting in a way like when you visit a circus and wonder how so many clowns can fit into one car.
That would, in fact, be interesting to find out.Catching up with a few of these interesting people was none other than Jimmy Kimmel s team on his late night show.
He interviewed a number of them on the street in Hollywood and told them that it s Hillary Clinton s birthday.
He then asked if they could say at least one nice thing about her for her birthday.
The replies were, let s just say, less than kind.One woman said: I can t say anything positive.
I d ask her if it s truly her birthday or if she s lying about that too.
Another guy said: Happy birthday, Hillary.
I hope you get arrested.
One woman did muster up the strength to compliment Hillary s hair, but she wasn t happy about saying it.It definitely seems like there s a lot of anger coming out of the Trump campaign and their supporters, along with a lot of false information.
Here s hoping they will be able to find happiness in life even when Hillary becomes president.Watch the segment and all their weird hatred towards Hillary here:[ad3media campaign= 1266 ]Featured image via video screen capture
