we think the stop hillary pac needs to double down on their ad campaign to make sure every american sees this brilliant ad : dear hillary clinton , i d like to ask you why you ignored calls for help in benghazi and then four americans were murdered , the ad starts .
i d like to know why you lied , saying the attack was a response to an internet video .
i d like to hear why you tried to silence the benghazi whistleblower .
but mrs. clinton , i can t. what difference does it make ?
