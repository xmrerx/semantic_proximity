the nationwide depression among democrats , specifically hillary supporters , has not declined much since the initial election day devastation occurred.they have now come up with a name for their plight , they re calling it post-election stress disorder .
the title is a nod toward the condition that many returning veterans experience , post traumatic stress disorder.ptsd is a serious disorder , it is believed to be responsible for suicides in a large number of active duty military and veterans .
every day , 22 veterans take their own lives .
that s a suicide every 65 minutes .
as shocking as the number is , it may actually be higher .
* some veterans are taking exception , with good reason , to liberals even insinuating that their disappointment over hillary clinton losing an election comes close to what is experienced on the battlefield .
