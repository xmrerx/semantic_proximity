abuja ( reuters ) - nigeria s president muhammadu buhari appealed for calm and an end to communal violence on saturday after police said armed herdsmen killed 19 people in the central state of plateau .
local police said fulani herdsmen attacked ancha village , in the bassa local government area of plateau state , in the early hours of friday .
they said it was thought to be a reprisal attack after a boy from the herding community was killed .
police provided details of the attack , in which five people were injured , late on friday .
fighting between semi-nomadic cattle herders and more settled communities over land use claims hundreds of lives a year in nigeria s central and northern states .
i urge all our communities in the state and the other parts of the country to embrace peace and bring to a stop these painful and unnecessary killings , said buhari , in an emailed statement .
he said communities and security agencies in plateau had taken steps to pull the state back from the brink of anarchy and senseless killings , adding that it would be a painful loss to allow these unsavory acts to return .
the violence is another security challenge for buhari in addition to the eight-year boko haram jihadist insurgency in the northeast and attempts to maintain a fragile ceasefire in the southern niger delta energy hub where militant attacks on oil facilities last year cut crude production by more than a third .
