BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Austria s likely next chancellor said on Thursday that EU membership talks with Turkey must be stopped.
Sebastian Kurz, whose conservative OVP party won the most votes in Sunday s parliamentary election, said after a meeting with German Manfred Weber, the head of the centre-right grouping in the European Parliament, that Turkey was not meeting the criteria for accession.
So entry negotiations with Turkey must be broken off, Kurz said in a tweet.
