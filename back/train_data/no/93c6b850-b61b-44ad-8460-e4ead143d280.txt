tashkent ( reuters ) - uzbek president shavkat mirziyoyev said on friday he would reform the central asian nation s state security service , adding that its power had become excessive under his predecessor islam karimov .
the national security service ( nss ) , the local successor to the soviet kgb , wielded sweeping powers under karimov who died in september 2016 after a quarter century-long rule criticized for systematic abuses of human rights .
rustam inoyatov , nss chairman since 1995 , is the only karimov-era senior security official still in his post , one year into mirziyoyev s presidency .
speaking to parliament on friday , mirziyoyev accused security bodies of rights abuses and called for deep reforms .
to strengthen national statehood , sovereignty , peace and stability of the people ... it is time to reform the work of the national security service , he said , asking mps to draft new legislation on law enforcement agencies .
at the moment , the national security service bases its work on a statute passed by the government 26 years ago .
the fact that this statute has remained untouched for a quarter of a century and that every problem was regarded as a threat to national security has led to a groundless expansion of this agency s powers .
