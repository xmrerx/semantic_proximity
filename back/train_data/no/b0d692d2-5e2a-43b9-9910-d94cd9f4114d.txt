how very progressive and how very ironic that our tyrannical president would take the opportunity to address how he plans to implement gun control in the u.s. while standing in paris , where only two weeks ago 130 unarmed people were slaughtered by armed terrorists.gun control , man-made climate change , open borders , one-world order just a few of the topics our anti-american president feels right at home discussing with a few comrades speaking from paris , france , on december 1 , president obama criticized the lack of gun control in the u.s. and pledged to remain focused on using executive action to enact new controls where possible.obama is in paris for a conference on climate change.during a press conference , obama was asked about the november 27 colorado springs planned parenthood attack that killed two civilians and a police officer .
he responded by claiming mass shootings are a something specifically american a problem not witnessed in other countries then criticized congressional inaction toward passing more gun control.according to bloomberg , obama said : in the united states we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides , that is unequaled by multiples of five , six , [ or ] ten , and i think the american people understand that .
so my hope is that , once again , this spurs a conversation and action.he said that congress , states , and local governments need to act , and he made it clear he will continue to focus on what [ he ] can do administratively , which is something he has been threatening to do since a gunman opened fire in the gun free zone at umpqua community college on october 1.on november 12 cbs news reported that obama has given a team of white house lawyers the job of finding a way that executive action can be used to expand background checks .
and breitbart news reported that part of what is being sought is an arbitrary threshold that can be set on private gun sales .
citizens who sell more than the allowable level will be forced to do background checks on every sale.obama and the democrat party have been obsessed with expanding background checks since adam lanza attacked sandy hook elementary on december 14 , 2012 .
yet it is interesting to note that expanded background checks would not have hindered that attack in the slightest , because lanza stole the guns he used he did not buy them.moreover , background checks are already expanded in colorado .
breitbart news previously reported that expanded background checks and a high capacity magazine ban are the law of the land in colorado , but neither were effectual in stopping the planned parenthood attack or the high profile public shooting that took place in co springs on halloween day .
