a health care executive cheated medicare out of $ 132 million and blew the money on a $ 7 million franklin mansion and courtside nba tickets , and stuffed secret storage units with cash , prosecutors allege.federal court records and prosecutors provided new details about the inner workings and riches of a health-care fraud conspiracy that ranks among the largest in detroit history , orchestrated by 37-year-old businessman mashiyat rashid .
prosecutors say the conspiracy involved recruiting homeless people as patients , sending phony bills to medicare , subjecting drug addicts to unnecessary back injections and prescribing powerful pain medication that ended up being sold on the street.the conspiracy generated so much money that rashid withdrew $ 500,000 from a bank this month and stuffed the cash in a duffel bag , the government said .
a surveillance team of federal agents watched him enter and leave the bank .
this was a crime of deceit .
his fraud was brazen , justice department trial attorney jacob foster said wednesday during rashid s bond hearing .
this was about the thousands and thousands of beneficiaries who were taken advantage of in order for ( rashid ) to line his pockets .
rashid , who lives in west bloomfield township , faces up to life in federal prison if convicted of crimes including health-care fraud conspiracy , money laundering and receiving kickbacks.rashid is not a flight risk or a criminal , defense lawyer mohammed nasser said .
he is a venture capitalist and business owner who paid $ 2.4 million in taxes last year .
rashid moved to the u.s. from bangladesh when he was 3 years old , graduated from the university of michigan , is married and has two young children .
he doesn t have as much as a speeding ticket , nasser said .
he has had absolutely no involvement with the criminal justice system .
this is his first parlay into the gamut of criminal law .
we are confident this will be resolved .
rashid is a flight risk , u.s. magistrate judge elizabeth stafford said , noting his international travel , ties to bangladesh and assets .
she ordered rashid held without bond pending an aug. 22 trial .
this is a uniquely troubling case in a lot of ways , stafford said .
