It s been more than three weeks since a group of terrorists, led by Ammon Bundy, took over Oregon s Malheur Wildlife Sanctuary.
Over that relatively short period of time, it appears the militia members have gone from mentally unbalanced to certifiably insane.Over the course of the terrorist occupation, various members of the group have posted various videos of themselves, including one that shows them taking down hidden cameras that are in plain site.The militants recently posted a video of themselves angrily discovering boxes of Native American artifacts in the basement of the wildlife refuge, which is exactly where they were left by the Burns Pauite Tribe that helped categorize them.Before that there was the video of militia member Jon Ritzheimer flipping his shit over an assortment of dildos and dicks that he got in the mail.But the most recent video to be published by a member of the group is the most insane yet.It shows a militia member named Kelly Gneiting challenging New Jersey governor Chris Christie to some kind of sumo duel.
Gneiting is dressed in what appears to be nothing but his underwear.The video appears to be the group s attempt at a response to statements made by Christie earlier this month.
Christie said Laws matter, and Laws have to be enforced, which in right-wing crazy language clearly means Kill them all.
In the video, Gneiting invites Christie to put on a diaper and slap bellies with him.There s been a lot of speculation about how the militia men have been spending their time over the past few weeks.
Isolated from society, with no one to turn to for comfort but each other, the terrorists have spawned more than a few Brokeback Mountain spoofs.There s even a twitter-based homoerotic fiction story, thanks to Colin Meloy of the Decemberists.Gneiting no doubt thought that inviting the governor of New Jersey to slap bellies with him, while wearing a diaper, would be a good way to make people stop questioning his sexuality on Twitter.Watch the video below, via Kelly Gneiting on YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture
