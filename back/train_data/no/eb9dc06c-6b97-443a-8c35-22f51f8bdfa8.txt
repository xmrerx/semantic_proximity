dublin ( reuters ) - the best way to avoid the return of a hard border between ireland and the british province of northern ireland after britain quits the european union is to continue to apply the same regulations on both sides , ireland s prime minister said on friday .
there is no demand from the irish government that any part of the united kingdom should remain in the ( eu ) customs union , what we want though is the language that we ve all agreed to ( on avoiding a hard border ) to be turned into reality , leo varadkar told a news conference after a meeting of the british irish council in the english channel island of jersey .
we believe that can be best achieved by continuing to apply the same sort of rules and regulations .
