jakarta ( reuters ) - indonesian authorities arrested nine men suspected of having links to a militant network loyal to islamic state and planning a series of attacks on police posts , said a police spokesman .
counter-terrorism police have grappled with a recent resurgence in homegrown radicalism in the world s largest muslim-majority country , inspired by extremist group islamic state .
police said eight men were arrested on tuesday in riau province and one man in south sulawesi province .
they were alleged to have links to indonesia s most high-profile militant network jemaah asharut daulah ( jad ) which is loyal to islamic state .
they were planning attacks on police stations from the district level all the way to the provincial level , national police spokesman rikwanto said of the men arrested in riau .
he added that the men were suspected of joining a training camp in a neighboring province where they learned to shoot guns and assemble bombs .
detachment 88 , the country s elite counter-terrorism police unit usually steps up surveillance and raids near the end of the year , foiling militant plots targeting new year s eve and christmas celebrations and popular tourist spots .
authorities suspect there are hundreds of islamic state sympathizers in indonesia , some of whom have traveled to syria to fight alongside the group .
there are heightened concerns over the return of battle-hardened militants as islamic state loses territory in the middle east .
four people were killed when islamic state-linked militants launched a gun-and-bomb attack in the heart of the capital jakarta in january , 2016 .
