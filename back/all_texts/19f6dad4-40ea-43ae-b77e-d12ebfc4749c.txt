LANGLEY, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told CIA officers on Saturday that he has great respect for the agency, denying that he had a feud with the intelligence community.
In his first official visit to a government agency as president, Trump was effusive with his praise, telling the officers, who came in on their time off to see him, that he loved them and had their back.
