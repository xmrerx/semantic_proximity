It s no secret that Trump s campaign isn t exactly raking in the donations.
After all, no one wants to risk being tied to a racist xenophobe who is running the biggest con job the American people have ever seen and pretending it s a presidential campaign.
Trump is being outspent by Hillary Clinton in a stunning 15-1 margin, and it doesn t seem that he s able to do anything about that right now.
To that end, what s an orange dictator-in-the-making to do when his opponent s campaign is so much more competent and well-funded?
When it s Donald Trump, there s just one answer to that question: Tweet.Trump has decided to literally beg his many fans on Twitter for money to fund his campaign.
Invoking his Crooked Hillary theme, he tweeted out to all the neo-Nazis, Klan members, misogynists, and other assorted bigots that litter his cesspool of a Twitter feed:To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign.
We must beat Crooked Hillary.

I mean, it s one thing for politicians and celebrities of various sorts to tweet out for donations to worthy causes, but nobody ever does that for themselves.
It really is astounding how the Trump presidential campaign is being run.
All it seems to be is a combination of social media insanity particularly on Twitter and violent rallies in which he fuels the fire of his bigoted masses.VOTE BLUE all the way down the ticket this fall, folks, unless you want this guy to be sitting in the Oval Office come January.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
