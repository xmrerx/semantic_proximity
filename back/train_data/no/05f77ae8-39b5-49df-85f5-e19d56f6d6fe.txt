in the realm of the nba , spurs head coach gregg popovich has been one of donald trump s most vocal critics .
he continued his cluelessness in the video below .
he obviously is watching too much cnn or msnbc because he uses some of the same buzzwords flying around.this coach has no idea what s really going on in the white house .
he only likes to spew lies about president trump just like every other armchair president wannabe.does politics belong in professional sports press conferences ?
we believe it doesn t. stick to the game and what you know .
don t spew political talking points for crying out loud .
popovich only makes himself look like a bitter man who can t get over the election .
