austin , texas ( reuters ) - the republican governor of texas signed into law on tuesday a measure that will restrict insurance coverage for abortions , compelling women to buy a supplemental plan if they want coverage for the procedure .
governor greg abbott said the measure known as house bill 214 would protect abortion opponents from subsidizing the procedure .
democratic critics decried it as forcing people to buy “ rape insurance. ” texas , the most-populous republican-controlled state , has been at the forefront in enacting abortion restrictions , with many of its measures followed by other socially conservative states .
but when hb 214 goes into law on dec. 1 , texas will be the 11th state to restrict abortion coverage in private insurance plans written in the state .
“ as a firm believer in texas values , i am proud to sign legislation that ensures no texan is ever required to pay for a procedure that ends the life of an unborn child , ” abbott said in a statement .
the republican sponsor of a senate bill on abortion insurance restriction , brandon creighton , has told local media supplemental coverage would cost $ 12 to $ 80 a year .
house bill 214 , which passed both chambers this month , mostly on a party-line vote , does not offer exceptions for cases of rape or incest .
abortion rights groups said they plan a court fight to prevent it from becoming law .
“ by signing hb 214 into law , governor abbott has told women and parents they must pay extra for what is tantamount to ‘ rape insurance , ’ ” democratic representative chris turner , who opposed the bill , said on tuesday .
there are 25 states with restrictions on abortion coverage in plans set up by state exchanges as part of the affordable care act under former democratic president barack obama , according to the guttmacher institute , which tracks such legislation .
also on tuesday , abbott signed another measure that expands reporting requirements for complications arising from abortions .
