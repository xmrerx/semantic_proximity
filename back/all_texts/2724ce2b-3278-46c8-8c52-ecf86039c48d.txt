Robin Williams was a one-of-a-kind comedian.
His brand of humor can never be replicated.
Fortunately, there are video clips of his performances that can still be found on the internet.The video clip below shows Robin Williams poking fun at Muslims, jihad, 72 virgins, the Quran, and taxi drivers.
The best part of the video is near the end, where Robin Williams actually calls out the audience for the reaction to his jokes, revealing their hypocrisy for bristling at his taxi joke because it was politically incorrect, while believing it was okay to laugh about beating the sh*t out of a Muslim terrorist.Only Robin Williams could have gotten away with calling his audience out not their ridiculous hypocrisy in the name of political correctness.Watch: Robin Williams on Jihad You are welcome #LaughOutLoud #SaturdayChillOutZone pic.twitter.com/WuZJIBGBB7 E I (@based4good) August 19, 2017
