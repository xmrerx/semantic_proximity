timika , indonesia ( reuters ) - u.s. miner freeport-mcmoran inc is evacuating spouses and children of workers from its giant indonesian copper mine after a string of shootings in the area raised security concerns .
the move follows efforts by indonesian authorities on friday to evacuate villages near freeport s grasberg mine in the eastern province of papua that authorities said had been occupied by armed separatists .
since august at least 12 people have been injured and two police officers have been killed by gunmen with suspected links to separatist rebels .
freeport has asked family and household members of its employees to prepare over the weekend for a temporary relocation from the mining town of tembagapura , about 10 km ( 6.2 miles ) from grasberg , company sources said .
workers have been asked to stay behind and maintain their work schedule , they said .
details of the evacuation or the number of people impacted were not immediately clear .
shots were fired at a light vehicle and two large mining trucks were set on fire at grasberg on saturday , one of the sources said .
the sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to talk to the media .
freeport in a statement on saturday confirmed the evacuation plan and said it will be carried out immediately .
we are working closely with government and law enforcement to ensure the safety of our people and those in the communities we support , and to bring about the return of peace and stability as soon as possible , it said .
grasberg is the world s second-largest copper mine by volume .
the separatist west papua national liberation army ( tpn-opm ) says it is at war with indonesian authorities and wants to destroy freeport in an effort to gain sovereignty for the region .
tpn-opm has claimed responsibility for the shootings but denies police allegations it took civilian hostages .
