baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi forces captured the akkas gas field from islamic state on thursday , oil minister jabar al-luaibi told reporters in baghdad .
iraqi forces launched an offensive last month to oust the militant group from the last area still under its control in iraq , on the border with syria , where the field is located .
the field hasn t entered production yet .
akkas , which has reserves of 5.6 trillion cubic feet , is operated by korea gas company ( kogas ) and located in western anbar province near the syrian border .
development of iraq s akkas gas field had been delayed after islamic state seized large territories in anbar in may 2014 .
kogas halted operations after multiple attacks by militants against the company s sites in the field .
iraqi oil ministry officials said they plan to send a crew to akkas to assess damages to the field s energy facilities .
we will make a field visit to write a report about the damages and what we need to bring back the field online as soon as possible , said engineer mohammed ibrahim who is a member of an oil ministry team supervising akkas .
iraq is planning to contact kogas soon to start preparations to resume development works at the field , said ibrahim .
security forces are working to clean akkas from landmines and booby-traps that might be left by daesh , said colonel saad hardan from anbar police .
