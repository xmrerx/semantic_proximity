according to the center for immigration studies , in 2012 approximately 51 percent of all immigrant households collected welfare : how the usda helps illegal aliens get free benefits paid for by you !
this is a problem .
a lot of american households also collect welfare , and that is a problem as well.a liberal newspaper claims it has obtained copies of two of president donald trump s upcoming executive orders that if implemented would once and for all stop immigrants from leeching off the american taxpayer.obtained by the washington post , the orders would reportedly deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge and set up standards for determining whether an alien is deportable for having become a public charge within five years of entry .
the underlying goal would be to make the u.s. immigration system more merit-based , so those with the potential to contribute to the country would be welcome , whereas those more likely to be a burden to the american taxpayer would be kept out.according to new york magazine , the order would also bar undocumented immigrants from accessing the child tax credit , even when their children are u.s. citizens , which would be a huge blow to illegal immigrant families hoping to cash in on their anchor babies.the simple fact is that as a sovereign nation , the united states reserves the right to demand the very best from anyone who aspires to live here .
it is a fact that the u.s. actually has much more lenient immigration policies than a large number of western countries that liberals profess to admire .
try immigrating to canada or western europe if you don t believe it.if an immigrant works hard , obtains citizenship and leads a good life but is later laid off and needs to collect welfare for a bit , that s one thing .
but when someone immigrates here and then immediately boards the welfare train , that is another and it s a problem that president trump hopes to finally resolve.for entire story : conservative tribune
