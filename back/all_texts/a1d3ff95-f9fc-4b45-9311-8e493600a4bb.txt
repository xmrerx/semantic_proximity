On Thursday, Donald Trump tweeted that if China, North Korea s sole major ally, doesn t deal with North Korea properly, the United States and its allies will.
Now China is neither an ally or enemy of the United States , but they are a major power with around 300 nuclear warheads and the largest army in the world a fact many of our allies would consider before backing us in any war that might involve them.
Trump would, as well, if he had any interest in averting World War III.
But, as Trump says, I love war.
We call on all parties to refrain from provoking and threatening each other, whether in words or actions, and not let the situation get to an irreversible and unmanageable stage, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Beijing, hoping to appeal to Trump s better nature and forgetting that he doesn t have one.
If a war occurs, the result is a situation in which everybody loses and there can be no winner, Yi added on Friday during a joint press conference with his French counterpart.
Lately, tensions have risen with the US and [South Korea] on one side, and [North Korea] on the other, and one has the feeling that a conflict could break out at any moment, Yi said, adding that the side provoking the conflict (Trump in this case or, more correctly, the taxpayers he represents) must assume the historic responsibility and pay the corresponding price.
As the world worries about what Trump will do to satisfy his massive ego especially after dropping the mother of all bombs recently he seems nonplussed, spending his weekend golfing instead of worrying about the crisis he has helped exacerbate.Will Trump risk a world war and a gigantic hit to the United States treasury?
I think we all know the answer to that: as soon as he is done golfing.
