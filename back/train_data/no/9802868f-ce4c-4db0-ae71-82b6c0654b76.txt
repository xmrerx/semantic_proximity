manila ( reuters ) - filipino lawyers on thursday announced a broad alliance to challenge president rodrigo duterte s 16-month war on drugs amid unprecedented scrutiny of the campaign in which more than 3,900 mostly urban , poor filipinos have been killed .
police say the deaths were in self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest .
critics dispute that and say executions are taking place , with zero accountability .
lawyers against extrajudicial killings adds to a growing number of voices calling on the government to end the campaign .
it is the duty of all lawyers to consistently , uncompromisingly uphold and defend human rights , said edre olalia , head of the national union of people s lawyers and one of the group s organizers .
duterte s spokesman , harry roque , a congressman and human rights lawyer , denied rights violations on the part of the president but welcomed the new group .
unless we can come up with actual evidence that there are extra-legal killings , then we can not overcome the presumption ( of regularity in the discharge of official functions ) , roque said .
he ( duterte ) will not tolerate murders .
he will only tolerate killings when it is in line with duty and when the engagement is legal , roque , who had prosecuted on behalf of murdered journalists , told reporters .
