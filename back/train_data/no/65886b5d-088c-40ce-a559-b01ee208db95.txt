madrid ( reuters ) - the influential catalan business lobby cercle d economia said on wednesday it was extremely worried by the prospect of catalonia declaring independence from spain and called for leaders from both sides to start talks .
such a declaration would plunge the country into an extraordinarily complex situation with unknown , but very serious consequences , the lobby said in a statement .
the lobby also condemned violence on sunday , saying catalan-spanish relationships had deteriorated as a consequence , after spanish riot police were seen beating catalans attempting to cast a ballot in a vote the government had said was illegal .
