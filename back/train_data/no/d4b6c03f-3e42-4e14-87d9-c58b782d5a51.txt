london ( reuters ) - britain s 91-year-old queen elizabeth has asked her eldest son , prince charles , to lay a wreath on her behalf at london s main war memorial on remembrance sunday , breaking with her usual custom of laying it herself .
the monarch will view the long wreath-laying ceremony at the cenotaph on whitehall in central london on nov. 12 from the balcony of the nearby foreign office , alongside her husband prince philip , who is 96 .
at her majesty s request , a wreath will be laid on her behalf by the prince of wales , buckingham palace said in a statement , referring to the heir-to-the-throne by his official title .
the wreath-laying itself involves bending over to place the wreath at the foot of the cenotaph , then walking backwards down a few steps .
a palace source said the queen had primarily made the decision to view the ceremony from the balcony to be with her husband , whilst also acknowledging that the event itself was demanding for someone in their 90s .
the head of state has been gradually reducing her workload and younger royals including charles have been taking up some of her duties .
philip retired from public life in august but was keen to attend the annual ceremony , which commemorates the fallen of two world wars and later conflicts .
the queen has missed the wreath-laying ceremony only six times in her 65-year reign .
on four of those occasions she was on foreign visits : to ghana in 1961 , brazil in 1968 , kenya in 1983 and south africa in 1999 .
she also missed the ceremonies in 1959 and 1963 , before the births of her two youngest children , prince andrew and prince edward .
