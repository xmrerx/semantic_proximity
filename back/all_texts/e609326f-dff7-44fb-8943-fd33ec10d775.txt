Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow is denying a story circulated by the Donald Trump presidential campaign that he will be a speaker at the Republican Convention.In a video posted to Facebook, Tebow said he just returned from the Phillipines and woke up this morning to find out I m speaking at the Republican national convention, it s amazing how fast rumors fly and that s exactly what that is, a rumor.
https://www.facebook.com/TimTebow/videos/500296036836329/Tebow points out that while one day it might be in the cards for him to be involved in politics, right now he s more interested in his work in the world of conservative Christianity.Tebow gained national notoriety as the quarterback for the University of Florida Gators where he won two national championships and the Heisman trophy.
He was less successful in the NFL where he played for four teams but never found a permanent place on a roster.
He is very popular with the religious right and has been part of the anti-choice movement.Earlier in the day, a spokesperson from Trump s campaign had confirmed to outlets that Tebow would be a speaker at the convention according to a reporter from NBC News.The denial again raises the question of how much can ever be believed from the Trump campaign.
They have constantly throughout the campaign told reporters and the public one thing while it turns out to be very different or not at all.How many other of the speakers rolled out by the Republican Party as speakers for the Convention will actually show up?
It is unclear.The list of speakers has also been criticized for being heavy on Trump family members, C and D list celebrities and Republican lawmakers (though many senators are skipping the convention, including high profile leaders like Senator John McCain).The convention has also been plagued by a push by a small faction of delegates to vote against Trump at the roll call.
Party chairman Reince Priebus has tried to tamp down on the rebellious faction, and even conducted secret meetings to undermine the effort.Featured image via YouTube
