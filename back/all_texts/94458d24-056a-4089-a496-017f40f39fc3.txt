CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Two men were injured in a drive-by shooting at South Africa s Cape Town International Airport, police said on Wednesday.
Operations at the airport, the second busiest in the country and a tourism hub, were not affected, police spokesman Vish Naidoo said, adding the motive for the shooting was unknown.
The airport is Africa s third busiest and handles around 10 million passengers a year, including tourists and businesspeople commuting to the economic hub Johannesburg.
A man, about 50 years of age, was shot in a drive-by shooting and in the process a bystander, a 30-year-old man, was also hit, Naidoo said.
The shooting took place in the early morning in a public area some distance from the airport s security gates, Naidoo said.
Flights had not been affected, the airport s general manager Deon Cloete said in a statement.
The shooting scene has been cordoned off while investigations continue, Cloete said.
Local media reported that the shooting was gang-related, but Naidoo could not confirm that was the motive.
