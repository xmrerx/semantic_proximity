berlin ( reuters ) - german foreign minister sigmar gabriel on saturday denied a report that said the social democrat , whose party has agreed to enter talks with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives on forming a coalition , was eyeing the post of finance minister .
news magazine der spiegel reported that gabriel had recently told senior members of his spd party that he was interested in becoming german finance minister if the spd agreed to a re-run of the current grand coalition with merkel s conservatives .
what spiegel is writing is sheer nonsense , gabriel told deutschlandfunk radio .
i m in a caretaker government and no one knows what the next government will look like .
more than two months after a national election , germany has not managed to form a new government , so the conservative coalition from the last legislative period is still in power .
merkel , who lost many supporters to the far-right in september s election , is banking on the spd to extend her 12-year tenure after attempts to cobble together an awkward three-way alliance with the liberal free democrats and environmentalist greens crumbled .
if the spd were to agree to another grand coalition - an option that the spd says is by no means a foregone conclusion - and demand the finance ministry , it would likely result in changes to germany s european policy such as more focus on spending and investment rather than austerity .
wolfgang schaeuble , who was germany s conservative finance minister until he took on the role of president in october , became unpopular among struggling euro zone states during his eight years in office due to his focus on austerity .
spd leader martin schulz said on thursday that europe could not afford to undergo another four years of the kind of european policy that schaeuble had practiced .
