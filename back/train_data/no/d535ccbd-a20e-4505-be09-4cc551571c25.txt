berlin ( reuters ) - fear of terrorism , political extremism and social tension due to mass migration are germans top concerns as they prepare to vote in a federal election , a survey showed on thursday .
worries about jobs and the economy have meanwhile fallen to record lows , according to the annual study by insurer r+v .
having presided over an economic upswing that has boosted wages and created jobs , chancellor angela merkel is widely expected to win a fourth term in the sept. 24 election .
some voters from her conservative alliance have however defected to the anti-immigrant alternative for germany ( afd ) over her decision in 2015 to open germany s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war in syria and iraq .
the r+v study showed terrorism remained the top fear , worrying 71 percent of germans compared to 73 percent last year , security officials have said the country should brace for further violence by islamist militants after it was hit by five attacks in 2016 , including one in december on a berlin christmas market that killed 12 people .
the fear of terror attacks is clearly in first place and is at one of the highest levels that has ever been measured , said brigitte roemstedt , who heads the r+v info centre that surveyed around 2,400 germans .
political extremism was the second biggest worry , troubling 62 percent of germans compared with 68 percent last year , while 61 percent fear that immigration could provoke social tension , down from 67 percent .
r+v said fear of unemployment and a poor economic situation were at record lows , while concerns about natural disasters and contaminated food had increased .
