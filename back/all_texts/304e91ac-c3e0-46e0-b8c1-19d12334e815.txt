I m convinced that whenever Trump says most people don t know, it really means I just learned.'
That was Chris Hayes s takeaway from watching Trump s flailing attempt to talk about Abraham Lincoln a man he clearly knew nothing about.
The fact that he was ignorant of one of America s most famous presidents was painfully obvious.An infamous bullshitter, Trump is either getting worse at it or we re getting better at spotting it.Trump was at a fundraiser for Republicans when he decided to share a little hidden gem about Abraham Lincoln that he assumed nobody knew: Lincoln was a Republican.For most people who graduated elementary school that is common knowledge.
For Trump, it was a revelation.
He was so impressed by it that he ordered Republicans to start paying to promote the fact.
Great president.
Most people don t even know he was a Republican.
Right?
Does anyone know?
A lot of people don t know that.
We have to build that up a little more.
Naturally, even that statement was a lie.
A recent Pew study found that over half of respondents knew that Lincoln was a Republican.Nevertheless, he instructed right-wing Political Action Committees to start buying television ads to inform the public that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.
The crowd politely laughed, unsure if it was a joke or not:The remainder of Trump s speech was equally insane.
At one point, he noted a few rival real estate developers in the crowd and had an on-stage meltdown.
He s President of the United States and still engaged in petty feuds with business tycoons that he views as his competitors.
His unfiltered rant is like watching his brain go to war with itself.
He knows he should be more dignified, less petty, but he just can t help it.This is, by far, my favorite bit from the president s speech tonight.
