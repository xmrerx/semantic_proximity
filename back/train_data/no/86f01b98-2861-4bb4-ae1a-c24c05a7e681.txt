rome ( reuters ) - the waters of rome s trevi fountain , one of italy s top tourist attractions , turned red on thursday after a man dumped dye into the main pool , a city official said .
police detained the man responsible , a statement from the mayor s office said , as city officials assessed if there had been any damage to the 18th century landmark .
the fountain , where tossing a coin into the pool is supposed by superstition to guarantee one s return to the eternal city , is a big tourist attraction in rome .
actress anita ekberg famously frolicked in the fountain s pool in the 1960 film la dolce vita .
acts like this demonstrate ignorance and a total lack of civic sense , deputy mayor luca bergamo said .
italian media said the culprit was the same person who dyed the fountain red in 2007 to protest the cost to the city of hosting an international film festival .
thursday s action took place on the opening day of rome s 2017 film festival .
