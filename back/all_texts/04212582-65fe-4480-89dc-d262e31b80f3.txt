Sean Hannity was on fire with bombshell after bombshell last night.
The entire video is so full of reports on scandal after scandal but the one towards the end is most disturbing.
Here s the one that is most important as it relates to Obama:Please go to the 23:55 point for the information on the uranium sale:HANNITY: Barack Obama purposely manipulated the process to allow this trucking company to be the conduit by which they got the uranium out of the country.
Tell us what you found.
JOHN SOLOMON HAD THIS SHOCKING REVELATION:SOLOMON: Yeah, there wasn t just one decision, we look at Uranium One and say we let them buy the mine and 20% of the ore that was being mined at that time under there control.
But there was a series of decisions made by the Obama administration time and time again, between 2010 and 2012 that are incredibly favorable to Russia s ROSATOM, the state owned nuclear energy industry, time and again these decisions are being made while the FBI knowns that there criminality going on by that company s executives HANNITY: The bribery, exhortation, money laundering, the racketeering, and so on.
SOLOMON: Yeah, Kickbacks.
And theres a second thing that I m just starting to report on now.
There we concerns in the Obama administration that where very specific concerns that Russia was engaged in a Uranium scheme that it was going to get enough control of uranium, dump it on the market, drive all the prices down HANNITY: Wow!SOLOMON: And put all the other people out of business.
Those are two legitimate national security concerns that don t seem to have had an effect on all these give aways.
