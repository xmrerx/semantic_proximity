Donald Trump made a lot of bullshit claims during his speech on the final night of the Republican National Convention.
On Friday, President Obama fact-checked the GOP nominee and said that the fears he expressed at the RNC simply don t jive with the facts.
The president was answering questions during a press conference following a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
He was asked about his reaction to the RNC.
Obama wasn t about to let the lies and twisting of facts Trump tried to pass off as truth go unchecked.During his speech accepting the Republican nomination, Trump tried to claim that crimes rates, particularly homicides, had risen under Obama.
The president took the opportunity on Monday to smack this down.
Some of the fears that were expressed throughout the week just don t jive with the facts, said President Obama.
When it comes to crime, the violent crime rate in America has been lower during my presidency than any time in the last three, four decades.
And although it is true we ve seen an uptick in murders and violent crime in some cities this year, the fact of the matter is the murder rate today, the violence rate today is far lower than when Ronald Reagan was president, and lower than when I took office.
Obama also noted that intentional killings of police officers are also lower than they were when Reagan was in office and when he took office.You can watch President Obama give Trump a dose of reality here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXOOhJMZMEw]Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
