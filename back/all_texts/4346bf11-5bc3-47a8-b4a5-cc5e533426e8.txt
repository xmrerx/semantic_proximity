The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA is spending an unusually high $500,000 for a digital ad campaign featuring a powerful indictment of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s cruelty towards disabled people.The ad, Dante, features a 17-year-old suffering from cancer and his reaction to Trump s mockery of a disabled reporter.Flashing cancer survivor tattoos on his forearms, Dante Latchman, 17, tells of surviving a rare spinal-cord affliction that was diagnosed when he was 1.
I ve spent my whole life fighting back, he says.
He is shown watching television and seeing Mr. Trump mock a reporter (Serge Kovaleski of The New York Times) who has a condition that limits the functioning of his joints.
I don t want a president who makes fun of me, I want a president who inspires me, Dante says.
That s not Donald Trump.
The ad drives home its theme a Stop Hate graphic flips to say Stop Trump as Dante is seen walking down the sidewalk with his mother, his gait noticeably laborious.A previous ad also showcased a family with a disabled child recoiling in horror at Trump s heartless behavior.Both the official Clinton campaign and Priorities USA are on the air, boosting Clinton and attacking Trump in multiple swing states with millions of dollars in advertising.
Clinton recently reported that her campaign had over $40 million on hand, while Trump came up extremely short with just over a million dollars.Despite his claim to be a billionaire, Trump has put no serious resources into his campaign and has been reluctant to do the type of fundraising that previous presidential candidates have done.Outside funding is a problem for Trump as well, as the super PAC supporting him, Restoring America Now, lacks the kind of money needed to advertise in swing states.
Instead, they are spending money to advertise on cable news, where most of the audience is already firmly in the Trump camp or against it, and unlikely to sway voing patterns.Featured image via YouTube
