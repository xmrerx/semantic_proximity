Another Republican has dropped out of the race.
This time, it s Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.
In a released statement, Paul said: It s been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House.
Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty.

Since the beginning of his candidacy, polls consistently showed Paul in the back of the pack.
Paul always failed to break away from Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, and even the lowly Jeb Bush.Paul struggled to raise money from both large and small donors, resulting in a cash strapped campaign that was never able to spend and then replenish through donors, whether big or small.
His ideas of a non-interventionist and non-violent approach in U.S. foreign policy apparently didn t sit well with Republicans.
Ted Cruz, the guy who plans on killing lots of folks, especially in the Middle East, is the current front runner for the Republican nomination.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons
