watch : sobbing woman confronts prime minister @ justintrudeau over the cost of her hydro bill # cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/mpac7v6noi globalnews.ca ( @ globalnews ) january 13 , 2017prime minister justin trudeau issued an ultimatum to the provinces in october 2016 , announcing his government s plan to set a minimum carbon tax even as environment ministers were meeting in montreal to discuss options for carbon pricing.several provinces and territories reacted angrily three environment ministers walked out of the federal-provincial climate talks after mr. trudeau s unilateral announcement in the house of commons .
saskatchewan premier brad wall said the decision is a betrayal of the co-operative approach the prime minister had promised and that the tax would devastate his province s economy.the self-described feminist leader of canada however seems hell-bent on pushing his radical agenda on his citizens .
kudos to this brave woman for speaking out against him
