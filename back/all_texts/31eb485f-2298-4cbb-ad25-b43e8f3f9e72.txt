JUSTICE FOR CHILDREN WITHOUT VOICES: We have spoken to Detective Luerra with Arcola Police Department and confirmed that the children seen in the video are safe and a case now has been opened.
Arcola Police Department is diligently working with CPS and the District Attorney s Office.
We want to send a HUGE thank you to Deputy Fisherhill and Detective Luerra for the fast response in making sure these children are safe.
And a huge thank you to all of our members who gave this child a voice and helped us get the info to the correct investigating department.
We look forward to working with this department, and with all of you, in the future as we advocate for our children and ensure them a voice!
Thank you!
When in the course of raising awareness, alarmism occurs, we would do well, as a civilized society, to acknowledge those alarming statistics and act accordingly.
We should never allow ourselves to believe falsely that awareness is enough when action is required.
