Donald Trump is terrible.
He wants to build a wall to keep brown people out of the country, blames all of our nation s problems on certain religious and ethnic groups, wants to force members of a single religion to be registered in a national database and to wear special little badges as they are rounded up and thrown into internment camps as a temporary measure, thinks Mexicans are mostly rapists hell, he even has been known to keep a book of Adolf Hitler s speeches by his bedside for light reading.Trump regularly retweets white supremacists, including their propaganda about African-Americans, throws out antisemitic imagery, and attracts the KKK and other white supremacist groups in droves.Unfortunately, the Republican Party proved themselves to be utterly without principles when they officially adopted many of Trump s ridiculous ideas into their official platform, and even continued his tradition of courting white supremacists by blowing up a tweet from one on a giant f*cking marquee.
Nothing can sum up what the Republican Party has become under Trump better than a scene from right-wing propagandist Laura Ingraham s speech at the RNC Wednesday.The content of Ingraham s mindless babbling that vaguely passes for a speech is unimportant it s how she ended it that is.
In the background was an image of Donald Trump with his arm and palm outstretched one that matches a familiar gesture commonly associated with a man whose name rhymes with Schmadoff Schmittler.
Ingraham turned to that photo and returned the gesture, then waved to the crowd.#RNCinCLE in one GIF: pic.twitter.com/OlrqbnKUVd Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) July 21, 2016Here is a still of the rather chilling scene:Twitter accuses Laura Ingraham of giving Trump 'Nazi salute' at the RNC https://t.co/YOjSZrkhQR pic.twitter.com/ETXqMvlQKD Haaretz.com (@haaretzcom) July 21, 2016Yes, that sure appears to be a brief Sieg heil to Donald Trump s photograph.This is what the Republican Party has become.
