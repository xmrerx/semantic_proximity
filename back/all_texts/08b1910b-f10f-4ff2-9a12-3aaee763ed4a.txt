What would you do if a gay couple requested that you bake a cake for them?
Probably bake it because you re not a bigot, but what if you were?
Would you take your battle to court?
Would you fight for a legal right to discriminate?
Well, Saturday Night Live takes us on the journey of one bigoted baker s fight to prove that God is a boob man and would not approve of gay cakes.This absolutely brilliant parody film promo points out the utter absurdity of the anti-LGBT laws so many states have put forward, and they went about it the most hilariously honest way possible.Those seeking legislated discrimination seem to think that the LGBT community wants special rights and privileges by just ordering cakes from bakers, or that they want everyone to think that God is gay as pointed out in this video.
These bigots fail to see that they re not the ones being persecuted, but rather the ones doing the persecuting.LGBT money doesn t have cooties, despite what anyone may have previously told you.
In fact, it spends just the same, and many gay couples often have a lot of it to spend since they re often dual income with no kids.Kudos to SNL for hitting the nail on the head with this video.
It s probably one of the funniest things they ve ever put out.
