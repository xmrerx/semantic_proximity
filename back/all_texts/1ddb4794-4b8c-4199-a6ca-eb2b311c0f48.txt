A father decided to record his daughter after she got her wisdom teeth removed and probably got a more interesting response than he bargained for.
In a video that is making the rounds on social media, he asks the teen girl if she would vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
At the mention of Trump s name, she instantly began crying.
Oh my God, Donald Trump is the redneck leader, she says quite accurately.
He s going to take you away from me.
Why would he take me away?
dad asks.
Because it s the redneck people that take us away from here, she replies once again, accurately.
She then begins rambling incoherently in what sounds like Arabic.
I need to go.
Oh my god, Allah needs to come protect me from this.
Then she begins praying.
Oh my god, he is a redneck, the girl says, adding that he looks like an orange and his parents were so ugly.
He s going to kick me out, he s going to kick all of us out, the hysterical girl cries as her father reminds her she was born in the United States, in Utah.Technically, that just means that he would force her to register in a national database, wear a special little badge informing everyone she is a Muslim, and be rounded up into a concentration camp you know, as a temporary measure.
The teen then notices her mouth is bleeding and asks, Is this blood from the rednecks?
While this is hilarious, the question of what Donald Trump will do to her family and every other Muslim in the United States must be weighing on the girl s mind in some form.
Unfortunately, Muslims will not like the answer to that.Watch the video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMxrjfoMmi4Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (John Moore)
