berlin ( reuters ) - angela merkel s conservatives maintained a strong lead over their rival social democrats ( spd ) , who lost ground slightly , in a poll published on thursday , three days before an election the german chancellor is set to win .
the forschungsgruppe wahlen poll for broadcaster zdf showed merkel s cdu/csu bloc was unchanged on 36 percent while the spd dropped by 1.5 points to 21.5 percent .
the anti-immigrant alternative for germany ( afd ) , which is expected to become the first far-right party in parliament for more than half a century , looked set to come third with 11 percent - one point more than last week .
the pro-business free democrats were on 10 percent , followed by the radical left on 8.5 percent and the greens on 8 percent .
that would present as potential alliance options a grand coalition between merkel s conservatives and the spd , or a three-way jamaica alliance of the conservatives , fdp and greens - so named because the colours of the parties match those of the caribbean island s flag .
in a theoretical direct vote for chancellor , merkel would win 56 percent while her spd challenger martin schulz would score 32 percent , according to the poll of 1,725 people conducted on sept. 20 and 21 .
