The reason the Baltimore Mayor gives for the huge settlement to the Gray family is just insane!
Just listen to her state that this settlement could prevent a future riot.
Who is she trying to fool here?
Is she getting a kick back from this settlement?
A much better use for the $6.4 million would be to help the businesses who lost everything in the riots because the police were told to stand down and do nothing while the city burned.
