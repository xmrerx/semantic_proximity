brasilia ( reuters ) - brazil s leftist workers party ( pt ) approved a resolution on saturday formally supporting the candidacy of former president luiz inacio lula da silva , as the nation s left continues to rally around the leader despite a corruption conviction .
we arrive in 2018 , an election year , with the candidacy of lula consolidated in such a way that it doesn t belong to the pt ; it belongs to the brazilian people , read the resolution , drafted by the party s national committee after a two-day meeting in sao paulo , brazil s largest city .
we must defend the candidacy against systemic attacks from coup mongers , that are going to use all means to stop the people from expressing their will in the elections .
lula , a former union leader who ran brazil from 2003 to 2011 , was convicted in july of accepting 3.7 million reais ( $ 1.12 million ) in bribes from an engineering firm in exchange for public works contracts .
if an appeals court fails to overturn the conviction on jan. 24 , he will be barred from running for elections scheduled for october 2018 .
even after the conviction , lula remains beloved by much of brazil s working class for bringing millions out of poverty through generous social welfare programs .
a datafolha poll released on dec. 2 showed lula getting at least 34 percent of votes if a presidential election were held today , double the support for his nearest rival .
if they dare find lula guilty , it will prove the political nature of the entire process , the pt resolution read .
