where s the outcry from the left about the mistreatment and relentless badgering of black conservative gop presidential candidate , dr. ben carson ?
are we to believe by listening to cnn or msnbc that the only thing americans care about is gay rights ?
does racism only apply to black democrats ?
wednesday morning on cnn s low-rated new day , co-anchor chris cuomo floated the idea that the rainbow gay pride flag might be equivalent to the confederate flag by asking presidential candidate if both should come down .
many people are equating what the confederate flag stands for with the gay pride flag , and saying , hey that flag should be taken down too because all it represents is hatred towards christians [ . ]
with cuomo you can never tell if a particular act of intellectual dishonesty on his part is based on the fact that he s a none-too-bright beneficiary of nepotism-privilege , or his raging left-wing biases.https : //youtu.be/pz4gdhjgtoyin chris cuomo s eternal , racist crusade to disqualify ben carson , the left-wing cnn anchor lied about the argument against the gay pride flag .
breitbart news was the first to make this point , and in doing so made it painfully clear that we were not making an equivalence argument.but cuomo has proven himself time and again to be either a dimwit or a serial fabricator ( jeff zucker s useful idiot , so to speak ) , and pointing out his dishonesty is becoming the ultimate dog-bites-man story .
