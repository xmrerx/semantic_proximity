MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish judge on Thursday issued a European arrest warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four members of his sacked cabinet, now in Belgium, after they failed to appear at a High Court hearing, newspaper La Vanguardia said.
A spokeswoman for the High Court could not confirm the warrant had been issued.
Spain s state prosecutor had asked the judge to issue such a warrant earlier in the day.
