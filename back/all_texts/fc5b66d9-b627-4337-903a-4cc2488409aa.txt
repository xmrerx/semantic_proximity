NEW YORK (Reuters) - A meeting in New York on Thursday between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has ended, a Trump transition team official said.
The hastily arranged meeting was an attempt to smooth relations following Trumpâ€™s campaign rhetoric that cast doubt on long-standing U.S. alliances.
