berlin ( reuters ) - germany welcomed u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson s announcement that he was probing opportunities for dialogue with north korea about its nuclear weapons program and called for washington to take a similar step with iran .
german foreign minister sigmar gabriel also warned in a statement that going back on a nuclear deal with iran signed by former u.s. president barack obama would risk undermining washington s credibility in negotiating with north korea .
in 2015 , tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the loosening of economic sanctions that had crippled its economy .
but u.s. president donald trump has called the deal an embarrassment and washington said last month it was weighing whether to pull out of it .
germany , one of the few western countries with a permanent embassy in pyongyang , has advocated peaceful approaches to de-escalating tensions on the korean peninsula and criticized some of trump s more bellicose rhetoric regarding the potential nuclear flashpoint .
this is exactly the right direction .
north korea would be well advised to take this offer of talks seriously .
gabriel said on sunday of tillerson s announcement .
he added : i would like to see a similar offer for iran .
if the u.s. canceled its nuclear deal with iran , that would undermine the credibility of its offer to north korea .
