The May 8 episode of Saturday Night Live featured a spoof commercial for Mattel s new President Barbie.
The commercial and the product are both fictional creations from the SNL team, who used the mock ad to highlight how far feminism has come in the 21st Century.As the video opens the narrator proclaims in a sing-song voice: We know our little girls can go as far as their imaginations will take them.
As cheerful music plays in the background viewers are entertained with scenes of pre-teen girls playing with things like rockets and engineering sets.The narrator goes on, saying: To show just how far we ve come, Mattel is proud to introduce President Barbie, the first Barbie Commander In Chief.
After this exciting build up, the scene shifts back to the girls, who just don t seem that into the doll.
Oh, neat, one of them replies half-heartedly, before putting the Barbie down to return to the construction set in front of her.
Don t you want to play with her?
the narrator asks, adding, She s a girl, just like you.
The girl responds by saying, Ya, but girls don t have to play with dolls.
We can play with whatever we want.
The narrator replies, That s true, you don t have to play with dolls, but it would be great if you played with this doll right now.
To this, one of the girls replies, I like Legos.
The mock spokesperson tries to boost the kids interest in the doll by saying: Oh but look, President Barbie even comes with sunglasses and a smart phone with Snapchat.
Do you like her now?
The girls remain unimpressed.
One of them replies, It feels like she s trying too hard.
The narrator explains: She is trying hard because there was a time when Barbie couldn t even be president.
In response one of the kids sums it up by saying: I wasn t alive then.
