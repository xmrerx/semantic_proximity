ankara ( reuters ) - turkish and sudanese intelligence agencies have captured and returned to turkey a man believed to be a financier for the u.s.-based cleric accused of orchestrating a failed coup in turkey , the state-run anadolu news agency said on monday .
citing security sources , anadolu said turkey s mit and sudan s niss intelligence agencies carried out a joint operation targeting memduh cikmaz in sudan and returned him to turkey early on monday .
cikmaz , labelled by turkish media a money safe for the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , is believed to have transferred millions of dollars to gulen s network from sudan since he fled there in january 2016 , anadolu said .
sudanese officials could not immediately be reached for comment .
gulen is accused by ankara of orchestrating the failed july 2016 coup against president tayyip erdogan .
he has denied any involvement .
since the abortive coup , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to gulen , while some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military , public and private sectors .
rights groups and some of turkey s western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says deeply infiltrated institutions such as the army , schools and courts .
