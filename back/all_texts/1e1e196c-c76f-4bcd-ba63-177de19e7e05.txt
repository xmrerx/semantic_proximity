The NRA tells us that guns make us safer, that a responsible gun owner or a good guy with a gun will leap into action at the first sign of danger to act as savior.
Unfortunately, many gun-toting individuals completely fail to live up to the gun rights organization s lofty ideals.
The problem is that a good guy with a gun is only a good guy until he pulls the trigger in a completely unwarranted situation like in a spat over dog poop.A Texas man found himself on the receiving end of gunfire after he Stood His Ground when a neighbor s puppy wandered into his yard and relieved itself.
Frustrated that the young animal came into his yard, ate his cat s food, and relieved itself, Joe Ramirez grabbed his trusty shotgun and ended its life.
In true responsible gun owner fashion, he told investigators that he thought the gun was loaded with blanks but, of course, it contained live ammunition.The dog s owner heard the gunfire and the sound of her pet yelping, so she ran outside to investigate.
Another person noticed, as well her neighbor, who applied a Second Amendment Solution to the situation.
When Angela Cruz saw Ramirez standing over the dog and shooting it at close range, she opened fire on him and his roommate, fortunately injuring neither of them.Cruz was arrested on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
Ramirez was charged with cruelty to a non-livestock animal.
The dog owner and Ramirez s roommate weere questioned, but were not charged with a crime.Unfortunately, as long as it is easy for quite literally anyone to buy a gun, we will continue to see incidents like this where popping off shots becomes the first solution rather than an option employed only in self-defense.
Ramirez should absolutely be charged and punished but think about how different the situation would have been if none of these people had guns.Watch a report on the shootings below:Featured image via screengrab
