these social justice warriors always think they know what s best for you and everyone else .
social justice is socialism so perhaps the white house press is correct .
it s easy to spread the wealth with other people s money pope francis and president obama have both dedicated their lives to helping the less fortunate , and that commonality will be central to their meeting wednesday during the pope s first visit to the united states , a white house spokesman said hours before obama left to greet the pontiff as he landed at andrews air force base tuesday afternoon .
both men have talked , quite publicly , about their commitment to social justice , white house spokesman josh earnest said in previewing their oval office meeting scheduled for wednesday morning .
and both men have dedicated their , not just their careers , but their lives , to that effort .
certainly the kind of commitment that we ve seen from pope francis is unique and singular , earnest allowed but i think the values that both men live out have some common ground .
earnest talked about how obama turned down high-paying jobs upon graduating law school to instead work in chicago s poor south side , and how francis is known for advocating on behalf of impoverished communities in his home country of argentina before ascending through the roman catholic church s ranks.via : gateway pundit
