Newsweek reporter Kurt Eichenwald came under fire Thursday after sending a tweet that incorrectly reported that Iowa supporters of president-elect Donald Trump booed astronaut and former senator John Glenn when informed of his recent passing.Eichenwald s initial tweet (which has since been deleted) racked up thousands of retweets and likes in a short time.
MediaiteWhen asked why they might have booed, he speculated that it was because Glenn was a Democrat.He just moved on, said "maybe they'll come around."
I think context was that Glenn was a democrat.

According to other reports on the ground, Trump said this while his supporters were booing protesters.Post-election Trump: as protesters heckle and crowd boos them, he says: "I think they're actually on our side.
They just don't know it yet."

The mainstream media is panicking over the realization that they ve lost their influence over Americans, and the market share with advertisers to alternative conservative alternative news sources.
And now, it s their obsession with convincing Americans that Trump worked with the Russians to influence the outcome of our election.After Eichenwald was caught fabricating story about Trump supporters, he made an apology on Twitter: Meanwhile, he s still trying to excuse Hillary s seizure in NYC at the 9-11 ceremony as pneumonia related:It s time to get over it Kurt Hillary lost.
America voted for a majority in the House and Senate, and for the next two years, there are no more chances at changing that simple fact.
