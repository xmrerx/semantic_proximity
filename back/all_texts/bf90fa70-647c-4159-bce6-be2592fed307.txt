More and more people have had just about enough of Donald Trump s ridiculous shenanigans.
Trump has been racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic, and has catered to groups that hate LGBT equality.
He s a person who has no right running for President of the United States, not only because of his bigoted views, but because he has absolutely no experience whatsoever.With Donald Trump being so scrutinized by so many, including the press that has the freedom to ask him questions and report what he says, Trump has taken action against the press.
He s been prohibiting news organizations from attending his events.
An action that goes directly against the freedom of press listed in the United States Constitution.
The latest publication Trump has gone after is the Washington Post.Now, taking action against Trump in the same regard, is Late Night host Seth Meyers.
On his latest show, Meyers brilliantly went after Trump for his reaction to the Orlando shooting, but also stated: As for the Washington Post, we here at Late Night believe in freedom of the press and therefore have decided to stand in solidarity with them.
So as long as the Washington Post is banned from Donald Trump s campaign, Donald Trump will be banned from ever coming on this show.
Good on you, Seth.
Hopefully that becomes a trend.Featured image via video screen capture
