the question is who obama will protect ?
will he stand by his yes woman , attorney general loretta lynch , or will he provide cover for hillary , allowing her to emerge as the successor to his corrupt two terms in office ?
our money is on obama protecting attorney general loretta lynch if valerie jarrett has anything to do with it a former u.s. attorney predicts a watergate-style showdown in the department of justice if attorney general loretta lynch overrules a potential fbi recommendation to indict democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton .
the [ fbi ] has so much information about criminal conduct by her and her staff that there is no way that they walk away from this , joseph digenova , formerly the district of columbia s u.s. attorney , told laura ingraham in a tuesday radio interview .
they are going to make a recommendation that people be charged and then loretta lynch is going to have the decision of a lifetime .
i believe that the evidence that the fbi is compiling will be so compelling that , unless [ lynch ] agrees to the charges , there will be a massive revolt inside the fbi , which she will not be able to survive as an attorney general .
it will be like watergate .
it will be unbelievable .
digenova is referring to the watergate scandal s saturday night massacre oct. 20 , 1973 , when president richard nixon sacked special prosecutor archibald cox and attorney general elliot richardson and deputy attorney general william ruckelshaus resigned in protest .
