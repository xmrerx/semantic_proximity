belgrade ( reuters ) - serbian gay right activists marched with their first openly lesbian prime minister through the streets of belgrade on sunday , protected by police in riot gear as a helicopter flew low overhead .
senior government officials joined hundreds of revelers on the belgrade pride parade an event campaigners said was a test of the conservative balkan state s rights record as it seeks to join the european union .
seven years ago , hardline nationalists attacked people at the march , prompting authorities to cancel it until 2015 .
the european union said in 2016 serbia needed to do more to help minorities including roma , disabled , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people .
serbia respects diversity , my message is that the serbian government is here for all of its citizens ... the people have the right to march , prime minister ana brnabic said as marchers waved rainbow flags and blew whistles around her .
co-organizer groan mile tic told reporters human rights had improved over the past decade .
we still have to work a lot more to make it even better , he said .
homophobia remains widespread in serbia and other societies in the balkans ; the head of the serbian orthodox church last week compared homosexuality to pedophilia and incest .
president aleksandar vucic , a former ultranationalist who has rebranded himself as a pro-western reformer , said this week he had no intention of joining the march .
pride parades have largely passed without trouble in serbia since 2015 .
