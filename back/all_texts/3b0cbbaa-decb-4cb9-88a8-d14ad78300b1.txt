UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas called on the United Nations on Wednesday to pursue efforts to bring an end to Israeli occupation of the state of Palestine within a set timeframe.
Abbas, addressing the United Nations General Assembly, warned that if the two-state solution were to be destroyed, Palestinians would have no choice but to continue the struggle and demand full rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine .
