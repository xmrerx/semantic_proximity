kibbutz shaar haamakim , israel ( reuters ) - an israeli kibbutz is taking considerable pride in a former volunteer , u.s. democratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders , even though no one on the communal farm can quite remember him .
in 1990 sanders , then running for congress , told israel ’ s haaretz newspaper he had volunteered for several months as a young man at kibbutz shaar haamakim , a community with deep socialist roots on the edge of the biblical jezreel valley in northern israel .
sanders , 74 , has mentioned in the past that he once worked on a kibbutz , but its name remained a mystery until haaretz republished its interview with him earlier this month .
there are no records at shaar haamakim of sanders ’ stint in 1963 and none of its veteran members can say for sure they ever met him .
that hasn ’ t stopped journalists from streaming into the community to try to dig for details about sanders ’ experience at the kibbutz , where the brooklyn-born vermont senator , who is jewish , is now the talk of the farm .
“ the fact that bernie sanders ’ name was linked with kibbutz shaar haamakim is a big honor for the kibbutz , ” said its chairman yair merom .
“ the values that bernie sanders speaks about and his ideology in the presidential race - the modern social democratic values - are incredibly compatible with kibbutz shaar haamakim. ” kibbutz elder albert ely , 79 , told reuters he couldn ’ t put a face to the name but he remembered that “ an american called bernard ” had once been a volunteer .
“ everybody mentions it .
now that the election campaign began , there is great happiness in the entire kibbutz , ” said gilad hershkikovich , who tends to its cows .
“ i ’ m sure he had a good time here. ” ( reporting by elana ringler ; writing by jeffrey heller ; editing by tom heneghan ) sap is the sponsor of this content .
