Has Nancy Pelosi been drinking?
She repeated herself and giggled while ordering the crowd at an GLAAD function to clap on command bullying became bulleting?
Wow!
It s a little unsettling when a woman who is supposedly a leader in Congress giggles like a young girl over and over.
If she s serious about the policy she s trying to promote then it s probably not the best idea to behave like this Ya think?
This isn t the first time Pelosi has behaved this way in front of the cameras.
We have a huge list of past gaffes and giggles from the California Rep:Nancy Pelosi: You Can t Cry Wolf in a Crowded Theater Not a day goes by that we have another gaffe from Nancy Pelosi Term Limits Please!.
@NancyPelosi screws up the oath of office while lecturing reporters about the seriousness of her job.

Not an omnibus, everything, minibus.
And it, on the subject of security, as you know, all of us, anyone who serves in government or civically involved takes an oath of office to protect and defend.
Support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
Our first responsibility is to protect the American people and our constitution.
If people are not safe, how can we proceed in any other way?
