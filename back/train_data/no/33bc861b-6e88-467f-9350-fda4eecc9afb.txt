tripoli ( reuters ) - libyan authorities are attempting to negotiate with a group that has cut water supplies to the libyan capital for the second time in two months to press for the release of a jailed ally , an official said on tuesday .
the group shut down pipes pumping water to tripoli and other coastal towns at the al-hasawna well system south of the capital , said tawfiq shwehaidi , a manager at the great man made river in the eastern city of benghazi .
today is the fifth day in a row that the water has stopped and we are trying to negotiate with them , he said .
the group , loyal to late former leader muammar gaddafi , is demanding the release of mabrouk ehnaish , a militia leader detained last month by tripoli s special deterrence force ( sdf ) , which is aligned with libya s u.n.-backed government .
ehnaish s backers have made various threats to sabotage infrastructure including oil and gas supplies , and in october blocked water supplies to the capital for about two weeks .
the great man made river is a pipeline system built under gaddafi that pumps water to coastal areas from underneath the country s southern desert .
the water cuts come as libyans struggle to cope with a steep decline in living standards during the conflict that developed after gaddafi s 2011 overthrow , and an economic crisis that has led to rapid inflation and severe cash shortages .
in recent days there have also been long queues for fuel and cooking gas in tripoli .
though distributors have denied any shortages , some residents nervous about disruption to supplies have queued for more than an hour to fill vehicles or jerry cans .
