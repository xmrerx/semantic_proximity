paris ( reuters ) - france s budget rapporteur on thursday asked the government to spell out how much the rich stood to gain if a wealth tax was scrapped , as unease over president emmanuel macron s plan within his own party bubbles up .
macron made good in early october on a campaign pledge to abolish the tax , earning him a president of the rich tag among critics .
joel giraud , a lawmaker from macron s republic on the move ( lrem ) party in charge of steering the 2018 budget bill through the lower house , sought details of how the wealthiest 1 percent would benefit .
in the light of the discussion of the 2018 budget law , it would be particularly useful for me to have a study of the impact of the tax and budget measures on the wealthiest french , giraud said in a letter to finance minister bruno le maire , seen by reuters .
le maire had on wednesday declined to respond to a similar request from the opposition .
the lrem s lawmakers , who hold a clear majority of 313 in the 577-strong assembly , have largely toed the party line since june , conscious of how closely their fortunes and macron s are linked .
but with macron s approval ratings on the wane and polls showing four in five french voters consider his policies slanted towards the rich , lrem lawmakers many of whom initially come from the left have started making their voices heard .
last week they proposed an amendment to the budget bill to increase taxes on luxury yachts and precious metals .
one of them , brigitte bourguignon , a former socialist who heads parliament s social affairs committee , last week told le parisien newspaper that she was one of a number who were pushing the government to do more on welfare , though she insisted she was no rebel .
the 2018 budget aims to cut both taxes and spending as france seeks to restore its fiscal credibility with its european neighbors .
macron s socialist predecessor francois hollande saw much of his reform program undermined by rebellion within his party .
