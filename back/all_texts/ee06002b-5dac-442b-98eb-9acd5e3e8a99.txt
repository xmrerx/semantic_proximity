Brunell Donald-Kyei: We want tougher immigration.
To make sure that our borders are safe!
That we are not fighting illegal aliens and refugees for jobs!
Americans are tired of fighting other people for jobs!
That frustration is real.
That hurt is real.
And for the pols and different people to dismiss that?
It s not right!
The most important issue to me is economics.
Because the last eight years the economy the poor people of this nation have suffered.
The middle class has suffered.
And let me tell you something: The American people don t want to be dealing with a President going into office with all the baggage, with all the investigations that are going to be on top of Hillary Clinton.Our nation needs to heal.
We want to heal.
We want peace between the races.
We want to make sure that our youth, whether they re white, black, Hispanic have jobs!
We want to make sure that the Constitution is protected!
Those are American issues!
that has absolutely nothing to do with your race.
That s to protect this nation!
And we want tougher immigration.
To make sure that our borders are safe!
That we are not fighting illegal aliens and refugees for jobs!
Americans are tired of fighting other people for jobs!
That frustration is real.
That hurt is real.
And for the pols and different people to dismiss that?
It s not right!
