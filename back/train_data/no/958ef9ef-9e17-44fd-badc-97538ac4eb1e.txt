karachi , pakistan ( reuters ) - pakistani police on monday exhumed the bodies of a young couple believed to have murdered by their families in a so-called honor killing , an investigator said .
zeeshan siddiqui said abdul hadi , 25 , already married with three children , and his 21-year-old cousin hussaini bibi ran away together a month ago and had yet to marry .
the couple had settled in a rented house in the southern city of karachi .
their landlord informed the police after the couple went missing .
the house had bloodstains and signs of murder .
questioning of their relatives led police to a graveyard where the bodies were exhumed , said the officer , who suspected the two families colluded in the killing .
honour killings are mostly carried out by relatives over the perceived damage to their honor when a girl decides to marry someone of her choosing or refuses to marry someone her family would pick .
the couple were from the kohistan tribal district of northwest pakistan .
in 2012 , four women and a girl were ordered to be killed by a tribal council in kohistan after a cell phone video of them dancing and singing apparently in a wedding became public .
