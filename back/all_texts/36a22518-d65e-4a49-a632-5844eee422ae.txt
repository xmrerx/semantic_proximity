WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Thursday called on the FBI to publicly confirm whether or not it is probing President Donald Trump, who said in a letter this week he had been assured that he was not under FBI investigation.
In a statement, Grassley said that now-former FBI Director James Comey had previously briefed him and the panel’s top Democrat, and that the lawmakers “heard nothing that contradicted the President’s statement.”
