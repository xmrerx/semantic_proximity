Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president and many in the GOP elite have a serious problem with this reality.
They don t have a problem with Trump because he s a racist, a chauvinist, or an advocate of violence.
Let s keep in mind that many Republican politicians have shown those tendencies, all be it veiled with civility.
Rather, today s GOP elite have a problem with Trump because he s got a big mouth about what the GOP stands for and because he s not a part of the elite Republican establishment.Well, Fox host Sean Hannity, a whack job in his own right, wasn t having it with the Republican establishment and quickly came to The Donald s rescue by becoming unhinged on his Fox News show.
In an interview with Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, Hannity appeared emotional and frustrated because of the lack of support coming for Trump from the heavy weights of the Republican Party, including Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, George H.W.
Bush, and George W. Bush.
To me it seems selfish, the whiny Hannity told the RNC chair.Priebus gave a measured response, telling Hannity that it s gonna take some time for some people to come to grips and to get to know Donald Trump and to get on board.
This has been going on a year!
Hannity pouted.
What do they need to know?
At one point Hannity went on the attack against House Speaker Paul Ryan saying, I m not ready to support Speaker Ryan anymore.
I m thinking maybe we need a new speaker.
To his credit, Donald Trump has done one thing that has made many people happy.
He has the Republican Party in shambles and that bodes well for democracy come November.Watch video here:Feature image via video screenshot.
